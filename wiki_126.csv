He has played in the Football League for Chesterfield, Lincoln City and Aldershot Town. Smith came through the youth ranks at Chesterfield, who had originally spotted him playing local football. He broke into the first team squad in 2001 and made his debut a year later. He was forced to undergo knee surgery in 2005 and has suffered several injuries during his career.

He trialled at Football League clubs Huddersfield Town and Oldham Athletic at the ages of 14 at 15 respectively. While playing for Kirkheaton he was spotted by Chesterfield and was invited for a trial match, and was eventually offered a place on the club' scholarship scheme. He began training with the first team during the 200102 season and was first named on the bench for Chesterfield's 10 victory over Reading at the Madejski Stadium on 1 December 2001. He made his debut in a Football League Trophy match against Port Vale on 22 November 2002, where he came on as a substitute in the 77th minute, and scored in the penalty shoot out that was eventually lost 43.

He went on to make further appearances that month against Brighton Hove Albion and Brentford, where he played on the left wing. He was offered a two year professional contract with Chesterfield in March 2004, effective from the 200405 season. His first league start for Chesterfield came in a 10 defeat to Hull City on 10 October. He underwent laparoscopic surgery on his knee to repair cartilage damage in February 2005, which was expected to rule him out for six weeks. He made his return on 18 March after coming on as a 60th minute substitute for Carlos Logan in a 22 draw with Brentford. Soon after making his return, he picked up an injury to his left ankle, which was sustained during Chesterfield's 32 defeat to Bournemouth. This ruled him out for the rest of the season, which he finished with 19 appearances. He was fit for the start of 200506 and set up two of Chesterfield's goals in the 31 opening day victory over Blackpool. He went on to score his first goals for Chesterfield with a brace after coming on as a half time substitute against Yeovil Town he scored from a pass from Paul Hall after Yeovil goalkeeper Chris Weale was left stranded after being lobbed, and then scored his second after gaining the ball from Mark Allott, which helped his team to a 31 victory. An 89th minute goal from Smith against Bradford City on 7 January 2006 saw his team earn a 10 victory. He agreed to a new two year contract at Chesterfield in March and finished 200506 with 29 appearances and scoring three goals. His recurring knee injury was confirmed to be severe patella tendinitis, which resulted in him being unfit for the start of 200607. He made his return to action in a friendly against Staveley Miners Welfare in August and made his first league appearance of the season in a 40 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 2 September 2006 after coming on as a 63rd minute substitute. He scored the winner for Chesterfield in the Football League Trophy against Oldham Athletic with a diagonal shot from distance. Smith suffered from a knee injury in March 2007, which resulted in him undergoing surgery that ruled him out for the remainder of the 200607 season in which he made 17 appearances and scored one goal, while Chesterfield were relegated to League Two. His severe tendinitis affected him in September, and eventually made his return in a 21 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup first round on 10 November. He was sent out on loan at League Two club Lincoln City for a month on 4 January 2008 and made his debut for the team a day later, helping set up the first goal in a 20 victory over Rochdale, after Jamie Forrester scored from goalkeeper Sam Russell's parry of a Smith effort. He made four appearances during his stay at Lincoln, all as a substitute, which was concluded after Lincoln decided against extending his loan at the club. Smith was released by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract at the end of 200708. He trialled with Darlington of League Two, but was told by manager Dave Penney he was not what they were looking for. He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 11 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August.

Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 11 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 31 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club in a higher division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this. York eventually made an offer of a quarter of Gainsborough's asking price, which was rejected. He signed for York permanently on 26 January for an undisclosed fee on a contract until the end of 200910 season. His first appearance after returning came as a 74th minute substitute in a 11 draw against Altrincham on 27 January. A bruised foot picked up in a reserve team match meant he was unable to play for York against Grays Athletic in April.

Soon after this match, he suffered from sciatica during a training session. He featured as a substitute in York's play off semi final first leg victory over Luton Town, which finished 10, with the tie ending 20 on aggregate. After finishing the season with 34 appearances and two goals for York he entered negotiations with the club over a new contract. He eventually turned down talks with York and agreed to sign a one year contract with fellow Conference team Mansfield Town on 19 May. On signing, Smith said It was time for a change after not getting as much football as I would have liked. I'm still young, Mansfield are going in the right direction and I'm excited about the new season .

Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 40 victory over Altrincham on 30 August.

"The Ashley Smith inquest was an Ontario coroner's inquest into the death of Ashley Smith, a teenager who died by self inflicted strangulation on 19 October 2007 while under suicide watch in custody at the Grand Valley Institution for Women. Despite guards watching her on video monitors, Smith was able to strangle herself with a strip of cloth, and it was 45 minutes before guards or supervisors entered her cell and confirmed her death. The warden and deputy warden were fired after the incident although the four guards and supervisors in immediate contact with Smith were initially charged with negligent homicide, those charges were withdrawn a year later. Smith's family brought a lawsuit against the Correctional Service of Canada CSC for negligence this lawsuit was settled out of court in May 2011. The CBC documentary news program The Fifth Estate produced two separate episodes on the life and death of Ashley Smith. The documentaries describe the circumstances leading up to her death, as well as some disagreement inside the Correctional Service of Canada. The Fifth Estate claims Corrections Canada filed an unprecedented publication ban on all exhibits presented at the coroner's inquest into her death. The inquest was frequently interrupted by multiple legal challenges and a change of coroner, before finally being terminated as a mistrial on 30 September 2011 a new inquest into Smith's death began on 19 September 2012. On 2 December 2013, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations with respect to a verdict on Smith's death. On 19 December 2013, the coroner's jury returned a verdict of homicide in the case of Ashley Smith, and provided dozens of recommendations to the presiding judge. Ashley Smith born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada was adopted when she was 5 days old, and according to her adoptive parents, Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13 14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a psychologist who found no evidence of mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre NBYC . Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself. On 29 January 2006, Ashley Smith turned 18 on 29 July a motion was made under the Youth Criminal Justice Act to transfer her to an adult facility. Smith hired a lawyer to fight the transfer, but was unsuccessful. On 5 October 2006, Smith was transferred to the Saint John Regional Correctional Centre SJRCC . Due to her behaviour at SJRCC, Smith spent most of her time there in segregation she was tasered twice and pepper sprayed once. On 31 October 2006, Smith was transferred to the Nova Institution for Women in Nova Scotia a federal institution . Through 2007, Smith was transferred a total of 17 times among the following 8 institutions during 11 months in federal custody While at Grand Valley Institution for Women in Kitchener, Ontario, on 16 October 2007, Smith requested to be transferred to a psychiatric facility she was placed on a formal suicide watch on 18 October. In the early hours of 19 October, Smith was videotaped placing a ligature around her neck, an act of self harm she had committed several times before. Guards did not enter her cell to intervene, and 45 minutes passed before she was examined and pronounced dead. On 25 October 2007, three guards and a supervisor at the Grand Valley Institution for Women were charged with criminal negligence causing death in relation to Smith's suicide the warden and deputy warden were fired, but warden Cindy Berry after almost a year was quietly rehired. The criminal charges against her subordinates were later dropped. No charges were ever brought against the warden or deputy warden. On 8 October 2009, Smith's family launched a wrongful death lawsuit against the Correctional Service of Canada, demanding C 11 million in damages the suit was eventually settled out of court in May 2011 for an undisclosed amount. On 8 January 2010, CBC News Network's The Fifth Estate broadcast a documentary about the case titled Out of Control. In the documentary, reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen year old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing crabapples at a mailman. Smith was placed in solitary confinement after disruptive behaviour on her first day. Her initial one month sentence would last almost four years, entirely in isolation, until her death in 2007. Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed. The frequent use of force reports required to document responses became a source of concern for facility officials. According to an internal document obtained and partially read aloud by Gartner, eventually Corrections Canada administrators instructed guards and supervisors not to respond to self strangling attempts by Smith, to ignore her, even if she was choking herself . CSC officials kept transferring her to other facilities, preventing the implementation of a Canadian law requiring mandatory review of prisoners kept in isolation for more than sixty days. After Smith's death, and the firing of both wardens and four directly involved officers, the four officers were charged with negligent homicide. The spokesman for the union for the four guards alleged the guards were scapegoated by senior management There was daily direction given right from the highest levels of management all the way to the front line staff, and we're not talking once or twice, we're talking everyday, repeatedly, 'you are not to go in the cell this is your orders' . The union's spokesman relayed his organization's stance that the guards' prosecution was part of a cover up by those in CSC management. At the conclusion of the documentary, Smith's mother raised the question of responsibility Who gave that order, Hana ... Who gave the order to keep that child, we're talking about a child in the youth centre, segregated that length of time Who gave the order 'don't intervene' if she's still breathing The four guards saw the charges against them dropped and were reinstated to their positions they declined to talk to The Fifth Estate. The Corrections Service of Canada viewed the case as closed, and while the current minister did talk to Hana Gartner, CSC refused any interviews with the reporter, while a lawsuit was pending. A second documentary titled Behind the Wall was first broadcast on 12 November 2010, and looks at the case of another similar detainee, while probing more closely at a four month period in Ashley Smith's detention while at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, Prairies, Saskatoon. The program also depicts the two year conflict between The Fifth Estate and CSC to broadcast more footage of the last days of Ashley Smith. The first coroner's inquest into Smith's suicide began in May 2011. The inquest, initially led by deputy chief coroner Dr. Bonita Porter, was controversial it was originally scheduled to begin in November 2010, but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family. As a result of this challenge, the scope of the inquest was broadened to cover the entire 11 month period of Smith's incarceration under the federal Correctional Service. Further, a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec. On 21 June 2011, the proceedings of the inquest were suspended until 12 September the reason for the delay was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast. In late June 2011, Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding coroner, apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011 the replacement presiding coroner was Dr. John R. Carlisle. The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith's family to formally accuse the chief coroner of interfering in the inquest with no legal basis Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she would deliver three outstanding rulings in July, days before the announcement of her replacement. The inquest resumed briefly on 12 September, only to be suspended once again until 19 September, when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new coroner to continue the inquest, and called for a mistrial. On 30 September 2011, the Ontario Coroner's Office formally terminated the inquest and dismissed the jury. A second inquest began on 20 September 2012, opening with a hearing for those who wished to apply for standing at the proceedings. Dr. John Carlisle continued as presiding coroner, and in a lengthy ruling released on 25 September 2012, granted standing at the inquest to Smith's family, prison authorities, inmate advocacy groups, and a group of current and former mental health patients known as the Empowerment Council. Dr. Carlisle further widened the scope of the inquest to include the effects of long term solitary confinement, repeated transfers between institutions across the country, the role of mental health care and the management of Smith as an inmate by prison authorities, and all youth custody issues arising from Smith's death. Motion hearings for the inquest took place on 2324 October 2012. Lawyers for the Correctional Service of Canada filed a motion to seal video materials and documents related to Smith's forced restraint and sedation while incarcerated in the Quebec prison facility when the motion was denied by the presiding coroner, the government lawyers requested a temporary injunction to stay the inquest proceedings through Ontario Divisional Court. This motion was also denied and the video and documentary material were made available to the inquest, which subsequently proceeded as planned. Additionally, three doctors involved in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged the expansion of the inquest to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario. Presiding Coroner Dr. Carlisle dismissed this motion at the same time as that of the Correctional Service of Canada motion, but subsequently granted the out of province doctors standing at the inquest when they agreed to testify voluntarily at the inquest proceedings. Formal hearings for the inquest began on 13 January 2013, and were expected to last between 6 months and a year. The jury of five women were expected to be presented with over 100 witnesses and 8000 documents in the course of the inquest. On 22 January 2013, the jurors were shown prison guard Valentino Burnett's 45 minute video of Smith tying her neck, asphyxiating, and the guards discovery and response. When questioned about their response, Valentino admitted that in a perfect world , the guards would have intervened to save Smith. On 2 December 2013, after more than a year of testimony and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations, and requested they come back with a verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of such an event. On 19 December 2013, the coroner's jury returned a verdict of homicide in the Ashley Smith case, indicating the actions of others contributed to her death but stopping short of a finding of criminal or civil liability. The jury additionally provided 104 recommendations to the presiding coroner, most of which were intended to suggest ways in which the Canadian Correctional System could better serve female inmates and inmates suffering from mental illness. The jury specifically recommended that indefinite solitary confinement should be banned. In November 2012, the Ashley Smith case began to have a visible impact on Canadian federal politics. After the public release of video material depicting Smith's treatment while incarcerated, interim leader of the federal Liberal Party Bob Rae raised the matter in Parliament during Question Period, asking why the government was attempting to restrict the scope of the inquiry through the Corrections Canada legal challenge. Prime Minister Stephen Harper responded that the government would not interfere with the inquest, and Public Safety Minister Vic Toews later indicated that Corrections Canada officials had been directed to cooperate with the inquest. However, Toews later appeared to contradict the official government stance and drew significant criticism from the opposition Liberal and NDP Members of Parliament when he suggested that Smith was not the victim in the case. On 8 November, Rae called for a formal public inquiry into Smith's treatment while incarcerated, and additionally into the treatment of mentally ill offenders by the Canadian prison system, after concluding publicly that the government would not release all the information it held relating to the Smith case. Subsequent to the release of the inquest verdict on 19 December 2013, the current Minister of Public Safety, Steven Blaney, stated that he had asked his officials to carefully review the jury's recommendations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley%20Smith%20inquest

After the funeral, Babe tells Sylvie, who is residing in a care home, that Stan has died, which frustrates Sylvie as she could not attend the funeral. Babe and Sylvie argue and exchange insults, leading to Babe slapping Sylvie. Sylvie then bites Babe's shoulder and threatens to report a criminal act that Babe and Queenie Trott Judy Cornwell committed several years earlier. Babe continues to create a rift between the Carter family and pays a teenager to throw a brick through the window of Shirley's son Dean Wicks's Matt Di Angelo salon. However, Dean's father, Buster Briggs Karl Howman , learns the truth behind the attack and confronts Babe in front of the Carters, tipping a trifle over her head. After realising Babe's deceit, Mick and Shirley force Babe to leave Walford, but Babe warns that she will return. A few months later, Mick and Tina go to Babe's house to confront her, as Stan's ashes have been replaced by custard powder, only to be greeted by a man who says that Babe has moved to Ramsgate.

Abi later reveals to a busy pub, including Ben and Paul, that she is pregnant, however it transpires Babe encouraged Abi to fake her pregnancy until she becomes pregnant.

The casting of Annette Badland was announced on 12 December 2013, when Badland commented, I'm thrilled to be joining the cast of EastEnders as I've always admired the show and everyone involved in it seems so warm hearted. Aunt Babe is a fabulous and complex woman and I can't wait to get stuck into the role. Executive producer, Dominic Treadwell Collins, introduced Babe as part of his plan to reinvigorate the show's older generation and teased Babe would start to fill in some holes in the dark Carter family history. Treadwell Collins later revealed that the billed personalities of Babe and Stan Carter Timothy West were actually swapped, with Babe actually being manipulative . Laura Morgan of Digital Spy liked the swap in personalities, although found it surprising. She commented, we've got to hand it to EastEnders for adopting this clever tactic. Speaking of how she received the role, Badland recalled that she had previously worked with Treadwell Collins on an independent film so she was requested for a chat with him, before they read through scenes from the show. She was subsequently offered the role of Babe, with Badland describing the process as terrifying . When discussing plotlines for 2014, Treadwell Collins said he wanted to see younger characters through the eyes of their parents and not the other way around and that was part of the reason behind Babe's introduction. Badland was filming episodes for Wizards vs Aliens and Outlander during 2014 and so, Babe was slowly introduced to the show. She appeared in eleven episodes between February and July 2014, before eventually appearing permanently from 8 September 2014.

She said she that Babe enjoys keeping control in a social way and that despite having a front of being jolly , Babe could also get very angry and be ruthless . She said that Babe is the kind of person who, when someone crosses her, just does and says the things that other people would not think of doing or saying until it is too late, and though she had tried to find trigger points that influence Babe's vengefulness, had realised that Babe was wicked just for the joy of it . Rebecca Scroggs, who plays Tosh Mackintosh, described Babe as a lovely woman with a darker side that could make her the most fearsome Carter of all .

Babe has a large amount of interaction with her family because she lives and works at the family's pub, The Queen Victoria. Babe is close with her niece Tina Carter, portrayed by Luisa Bradshaw White, and Badland said that Babe has a soft spot for Tina and would always try to help her. Babe is wary of Tina's partner Tosh Mackintosh, portrayed by Rebecca Scroggs, so when Tina is attacked by Tosh, Babe becomes protective of Tina. Babe has a tense relationship with Tina's older sister Shirley Carter, portrayed by Linda Henry, as they share an emotional history. Badland believed Babe loves Shirley, but would protect herself over Shirley. Hughes Digital Spy described Babe as the bad apple of the Carter family. Shirley and Tina's brother Mick Carter, portrayed by Danny Dyer, was revealed to the audience as Shirley's son. Badland explained that Babe and Shirley's mother, Sylvie Carter, portrayed by Linda Marlowe, knew this because they covered up Shirley's pregnancy and helped her give birth, which estranged Shirley from Babe. Babe threatens Shirley with her knowledge and promises to tell Mick if Shirley crosses her. Babe is unmarried and has no children so Shirley, Tina and Mick are the closest thing she ever had to children and her backstory states she was devastated when Tina and Mick were taken into care.

The reason for their shared hatred was not explained until Sylvie arrived, when it was revealed that Babe was in love with Stan and believed Sylvie stole Stan when they were younger.

All About Soap said that all those years of unrequited love ... made Babe pretty bitter .

Stan becomes engaged to Cora Cross Ann Mitchell and when his health deteriorates, they decide to marry quickly. Babe attempts to ruin it by bringing Sylvie to see Stan, but they decide to marry nevertheless. Babe is delighted when Stan is physically unable to say his vows, but is devastated when he dies. Gary Gillatt of Inside Soap expressed his approval of Babe's rivalry with Cora and said, there's a hot new rivalry in Walford and we can't get enough if it Babe dislikes Shirley's son Dean Wicks, portrayed by Matt Di Angelo, and Badland explained that Babe thinks Dean is hot headed and a slippery fish .

Following Babe's arrival, it was speculated that she could be in contact with her sister, Sylvie Marlowe . In her first episode, Babe was shown to be frequently in contact with her, despite telling Shirley she had not spoken to her. In a later episode, Babe claims to the Carter family that she lives alone and feels lonely without Sylvie, having not been in contact with her. Babe also claims that she misses having someone to share half a beer with at the end of a long day. However, later scenes in the episodes depict Babe talking to an unknown person off screen as she opens a bottle of beer for them to share. On 1 August 2014, it was announced that Sylvie would be introduced to the show, but no character details or casting news were announced. Marlowe's casting was announced on 23 September 2014 and Treadwell Collins promised that Sylvie's appearance would open old wounds in the Carter family . He added that watching Linda Marlowe, Annette Badland, Ann Mitchell and Timothy West going for it on screen is going to be electric. Marlowe explained that Babe had hidden Sylvie away because of her Alzheimer's disease and the behaviour that accompanies the illness. She noted that Babe and Sylvie were close because they were fond of each other, but opined that Sylvie is a little bit intimidated by Babe because she can be very scary and a bit conniving . Hughes Digital Spy disapproved of Babe's treatment of Sylvie and noted that Babe struggled to overcome Stan choosing Sylvie instead of her, making her a woman with issues. Daniel Kilkelly of entertainment website Digital Spy on Babe's influence on Abi. 2016 Producers created a friendship between Babe and Abi Branning Lorna Fitzgerald and used Babe to manipulate Abi. Fitzgerald believed that Abi was easily manipulated by characters who are stronger than her because she was very vulnerable . Sophie Dainty, writing for Digital Spy, branded Babe an unlikely ally for Abi. Lindsay Metro described Babe and Abi as a villanious double act which was genius and the most bonkers and outrageous double acts of all time in soap . Abi wants a family unit for her and her boyfriend, Ben Mitchell Harry Reid , despite Ben being a closeted homosexual and hopes to get pregnant by Ben, but he stuns her by revealing he has contracted an STI. Babe comforts Abi and Fitzgerald explained, Abi thinks Babe is looking out for her, and she trusts her . Tyler Inside Soap praised Babe's involvement in Abi's fake pregnancy, writing, We're beyond thrilled that Aunt Babe is back to her wicked best leading Abi into disaster just because Babe herself was once ditched by her true love Stan. She added that she especially enjoyed Babe's assumption that Abi is a lesbian, and that she and Ben are each other's 'beards' and thought the scene was funny. Babe encourages Abi to tell Ben she is pregnant. Fitzgerald explained that when Babe suggests the idea, Abi decides to trust her. Lindsay believed the moment Abi tells Ben she is pregnant had Babe written all over it , adding that as a puppet of Aunt Babe's, there isn't much hope for Abi . Digital Spy named the moment the bombshell of all bombshells . Viewers speculated that Abi had lied about the pregnancy and the Sunday Express questioned whether Babe had put the idea in Abi's head . The speculation was confirmed in the following episode. Lindsay believed that in the weeks following the scene, viewers would laugh at Babe and Abi, cry for them, feel for them, root for them and scream furiously at them while throwing plates at televisions. Fitzgerald enjoyed Babe and Abi's friendship and said she loved working with Badland, while Badland also liked working with Fitzgerald, saying that she thought Babe and Abi had genuinely connected but their friendship was inevitably soured with all the shenanigans . Lindsay praised the show for recognising the qualities this insane partnership has and suggested the portmanteau Babi for their pairing.

Abi's attempt at getting pregnant is unsuccessful so when Abi suffers a fall in The Vic, Babe persuades Abi to fake a miscarriage. This leaves Ben crushed when he learns of Abi's miscarriage.

Deen Metro opined that Abi created a deal with the devil when she asked for help from Babe. She noted that while it all blew up in Abi's face , Babe stood back and watched the fireworks. Dainty noted that the baby storyline concluded with a somewhat dramatic end . Babe threatens Abi and burns her as a way of keeping her in the clear. Deen included the scene where Babe deliberately burns Abi in her list of 12 times soaps were scarier than any horror movie . She described the moment as chilling , writing, The fact that the grim moment isn't seen you just hear Abi's anguished scream makes it even more terrifying. In a separate article, Deen also praised the scene where Babe forced her way into Abi's house and said, the way she says 'watch your back' makes our blood run cold. In 2017, Lindsay opined that Babe should receive her comeuppance and that Abi needs to be instrumental in this.

On Babe's reasons for revealing the secret, Badland explained, She's not sure where she stands, but she's desperate to get back inside the family. She loves Mick so much she wants to be around him. Linda and Mick have hurt her and you mustn't do that... Babe can get very upset Abi consequently reveals that Babe encouraged her to have a one night stand, which causes Mick and Linda to reject Babe. However, after she is attacked, Mick and Linda try to fix their relationship with Babe. Of Mick and Linda making amends with Babe, Badland explained, Although it might appear on the surface the Carters have forgiven her for playing a part in Abi's fake pregnancy lie and encouraging her to sleep with Lee, there could be repercussions further down the line. The show reintroduced Mick's mother in law Elaine Peacock Maria Friedman in October 2015 and introduced her toy boy lover Jason Adams portrayed by Scott Neal . It was reported on 29 September 2015 that Babe and Jason would be caught in a state of undress by Mick and his partner, Linda Carter Kellie Bright .

Babe's baby farming secret was met with shock and disgust by viewers on Twitter. All About Soap said that Babe's illegal baby selling business run from a grubby caravan in Ramsgate is pretty murky . Deen Metro said the storyline was one of Babe's darkest storylines and praised the scenes where Babe set her caravan alight, writing, Like all good soap villains, Babe hit the self destruct button in spectacular fashion, making her family believe briefly that she had perished inside the caravan fire. Shelley Daily Mail was critical of Babe's excuse for baby farming, We were victims of our own success , and struggled to understand why the Carter family invited Babe to live with them in Walford, describing it as inexplicable . He was disappointed that the week long episodes had ended on a shot of Babe moving her marijuana plants and noted that it confirmed nothing much will have changed when she gets back home with the family. Comparing the baby farming storyline and Abi's fake pregnancy, Brown Radio Times questioned Babe's baby obsessed nature, writing, what is it with her keen interest in other people's newborns .

Babe witnesses this and steals a half burnt photograph of Christine. Badland said that Babe is quite Dickensian in the way that she finds things and slips them into her pocket to use against people The storyline was revisited in May 2016 when Babe begins anonymously blackmailing Les and Pam in exchange for her silence. Of Babe's motivation to blackmail the Cokers, Badland said that Babe hasn't got any respect for Pam and Les and she's using them to get money. It's as simple as that really. She also said that she resents seeing and Pam together as a unit after he rejects her romantic advances, because she has never had what they have . When Les threatens to inform the police about her blackmail, Babe increases the price of the blackmail so Pam tries to appeal to Babe's better nature . A reporter from Soaplife believed that this would get Pam absolutely nowhere because Babe does not have a better side. Pam is unable to appeal to her better nature and a show insider explained that Pam doesn't see that she has any other option but to pay up . Billy Mitchell Perry Fenwick discovers Les's secret, which made Kilkelly Digital Spy believe that it's only a matter of time before more characters find out. He opined that it would be refreshing to see Babe receive the backlash for putting the Cokers through months of misery . He also described Babe as a vicious blackmailler who should be ashamed . Following the death of their grandson, Les and Pam confess their blackmail secret to their friend, Claudette Hubbard Ellen Thomas , who warns Babe to end the blackmail. However, despite Claudette's warnings, Babe continues to blackmail the Cokers. This sparks tension between Babe and Claudette, who tells Babe that she will be moving back to the square to keep a closer eye on her. Badland explained Babe's rivalry with Claudette Claudette's sticking up for Les and Pam. She's a fair match for Babe and it's interesting when they go head to head. Badland hoped that the feud would last a long time, opining that it was fabulous , and that neither will back down easily , and adding that she thought Babe would triumph over Claudette, though admitted she was biased and probably the only person on Babe's side . An Inside Soap reporter said Babe and Claudette's feud was exciting because Claudette is fearsome and Babe is equally terrifying , and suspected that Cunning Babe be so easily intimidated . A reporter for All About Soap questioned if Babe had finally met her match in Claudette, and compared the two women. In terms of cunning, they said that Babe has it by the bucketload , while Claudette may be getting soft in her old age and may not be sharp enough to take on Babe . They also opined that Claudette had more fighting strength as she continues to come back after a knock down and would not go down without a fight, while Babe's craftiness means she'd easily come up with a new way to destroy an enemy . They said that Claudette has a nasty and murderous history while Babe's past is chequered but she had never killed someone, concluding that Claudette would be the winner of the feud, but still saying that they wouldn't mess with Babe .

The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's duff duff . Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack takes Babe by surprise as she clearly didn't know there was somebody out there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming. She opined that Babe doesn't think for a minute that Abi could ever get the better of her. On 18 September 2016, it was announced that Babe would be written out of the series in 2017, having appeared on the show for three years. A show spokesperson recalled that before moving to Walford, Babe was seen coming and going from The Square with her own life and stated that she would still very much be in the wings and could cause aggro for the Carters. Ian Sandwell of Digital Spy hoped that Babe's exit storyline would see her receive her just deserts as punishment for her despicable schemes , but believed that she would get away without getting a proper comeuppance. The Metro ran a poll on their website to ask readers for their opinions on whether they would miss the character when she left the show 71 of people who answered said they would not miss her because she is awful , while the other 29 said they would miss her and agreed that she brought brilliant drama to the show.

She made the shortlist in 2016, but lost out on the award to Hollyoaks' Persephone Swales Dawson, who played Nico Blake. Shelley Daily Mail regularly spoke negatively of the character and wrote, The most eccentric member of the Carter clan may dress like a female version of Compo from Last of The Summer Wine but she acts like the meanest con in Prisoner Cell Block H. He added that the characters of Babe, Sylvie and Stan are unremittingly grim and unappealing , but Babe was namingly gratuitously vile . Shelley was pleased when Babe left in May 2015 and said the last thing anyone wanted was for her to come back when discussing her return in September 2015. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy praised Babe's introduction, writing that her addition worked beautifully . Sally Brockway, writing for magazine Soaplife, wrote, She may rustle up a mean trifle, but you'll pay the price if you get on the wrong side of Aunt Babe Smith. Ellis Inside Soap said, Of all the villains in Walford, we never would have thought that a trifle making, Reliant Rialto driving, apron wearing aunt would turn out to be the most fearsome She may not have the brute force of Phil Mitchell or the steely determination of Gavin Sullivan, but Babe is not someone we'd ever want to do battle with. A reporter from Soaplife noted that Babe's own desperation that makes her the monster of the woman she is... On Babe's evil streak, Morgan Digital Spy said that Babe was about as bad as they get . She observed that Babe began by fooling people her smiles and tasty looking trifles , but her family soon realised her wicked ways . In June 2016, Dainty Digital Spy included Babe in a list of soap opera villains she hoped would get their comeuppance, stating, Cold, callous and cruel Aunt Babe is fast emerging as one of Walford's most unexpected villains, but we think it's time she got her just deserts. ... Babe has got away with many a manipulative scheme over the years, but her treatment of lovely Les and Pam is just one step too far. Because we are very much Team Coker over here, we'd like to see Aunt Babe brought down a peg or two. And soon. Badland explained in an interview with Lindsay Metro that some fans of the character have cried at her actions and sympathise with her. Members of the Digital Spy forums labelled Babe the show's current June 2016 most hated character, adding that Babe was compelling to watch and an evil character that people will remember in years to come . One member also praised Badland's spot on performance. In a 2017 storyline, Babe hosted a 'Twelfth Night' event at The Vic where she secretly served pigeon pie. Justin Harp of Digital Spy expressed his disgust at this and demanded a lifelong Queen Vic ban was handed to her. Deen Metro described Babe swapping Stan's ashes for custard power as a seriously grim move that only Babe could have thought of.

Kate White Inside Soap said that EastEnders should hang on to Babe, giving the reasons that she always makes things happen , she's genuinely very sinister and she's so entertaining , stating that her various scams show that she is totally fearless when it comes to taking on the locals and can be relied upon to generate entertaining storylinessomething Walford has been short of lately . White went on to say that Babe can do more than in a week with just one evil look and called her properly unhinged , saying that Babe is the sort of silent threat that many underestimate at their peril . Finally, White said that Badland had used every look and gesture to build up Babe's eccentric personality, and has been able to skip lightly frin dark to hilarious in a hearbeat. Babe has had us in stitches over the years, as well as frightening us silly. Surely you'd be mad to let go of a character that versatile Writing about Babe's final words, where she curses the Carter family and The Queen Victoria, an Inside Soap writer said, The departing Aunt Babe, raging into the storm like some Disney witch, was the undoubted highlight of our soap week. Tyler Inside Soap said that Babe's departure was the most wonderfully outrageous episode of EastEnders in months. Annette Badland's roar, as Babe cursed the entire Square, was camp, shameless, preposterousand soap gold. We sincerely hope this isn't the last we see of her. Babe's revenge plot is too much fun to waste Specific General",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe%20Smith
"Henry Franklin Buster Smith August 24, 1904 August 10, 1991 , also known as Professor Smith, was an American jazz alto saxophonist and mentor to Charlie Parker. Smith was instrumental in instituting the Texas Sax Sound with Count Basie and Lester Young in the 1930s. Smith played saxophone for a number of prominent band leaders including Duke Ellington and Earl Hines as well as vocalist Ella Fitzgerald. He recorded his only album as leader in 1959 and despite intending to record a follow up, he was injured in an accident and nothing else was released. Smith was born and raised in Alsdorf, Texas, a small township near Telico in the outskirts of Dallas, where he attended school as a child. Smith earned the name Buster from his parents as a baby, as he was born as an overweight child. Buster was the third of five boys and had no sisters, though both of his older brothers died in childhood of measles. Smith's early musical influences were his mother, and his father, who played guitar. At the age of four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because he believed it would only direct Buster to a life of sin. In 1919, Smith picked cotton for a week to earn himself the money to buy a 3.50 clarinet. Smith learned to play several instruments by the time he was eighteen years old. In 1922, Smith and his family moved to Dallas. He joined the Voodie White Trio, playing Alto saxophone and clarinet. In 1923, he began his professional music career playing alto saxophone with the medicine shows, though he had to play very loudly to draw in more customers. This experience led to Smith defining his own musical style, known for being loud. The time with the medicine shows also led to Oran Hot Lips Page inviting Smith to join his group, the Oklahoma City Blue Devils, in 1925. Over the next few years, Smith wrote much of the group's music, learning from banjo player Johnny Clark, writing lyrics with co workers from the bank that he worked in. When Smith joined the Blue Devils, the line up consisted of Walter Page, Oran Page, Lester Young, Count Basie, Jimmy Rushing, and Emir Bucket Coleman. They toured the Kansas City area and the Midwest, playing jazz for a year, bringing all of its members into prominence. Basie and Page both left the group however Smith decided to stay on, though this was very short lived and soon after he left also. After leaving the group, he and Basie formed the Buster Smith Count Basie Band of Rhythm, where the two innovated a louder style of Jazz. Buster's contribution to the unique sound was by using a tenor saxophone reed in his alto saxophone to achieve a louder, fatter sound. Lester Young also joined the band and, to complement Smith's louder sound, he also opted for a harder reed, using a baritone saxophone reed on his tenor saxophone. This sound was later labelled the Texas Sax Sound. Smith gained a great amount of influence in the Texan music community and industry. Smith mentored legendary saxophonist Charlie Parker during the 1930s, developing a father son relationship through mentoring Parker. In 1941, Smith decided to return to Dallas and to cease touring, though he remained active in the local music scene. In the following years, he wrote for jazz and blues bands, played often, and taught many young Texan musicians, including Aaron T Bone Walker and Red Garland among others. He also performed session work with artists such as Pete Johnson's Boogie Woogie Boys, Eddie Durham, Leo Snub Mosley, Bon and His Buddies, and the Don Redman Orchestra. In 1959, Buster led his first solo recording session in Fort Worth, as prompted by Atlantic Records. From these sessions, released by Atlantic with the title The Legendary Buster Smith, Smith's notable songs included Kansas City Riffs, Buster's Tune, E Flat Boogie, and Kurt Weill's September Song. For the sessions, Buster enlisted his brother Boston Smith to play piano, along with musicians spanning his career to date. In the 1960s, Smith was involved in an auto accident, in which he was injured and no longer able to play the saxophone. In order to continue playing music, he started to play the bass guitar throughout Dallas and continued to participate in the Dallas musical community. Buster led a dance music band until 1980, and played in the Legendary Revelations in the mid 1980s. Smith died in Dallas on August 10, 1991 of a heart attack.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster%20Smith
"Christopher Alan Smith born 30 June 1981 is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre back in the Football League for York City. Smith started his career with Leeds United's youth system, but aged 15 joined Reading in their youth system. In 1999, he signed a professional contract, before joining Third Division club York City in 2001. In the 200102 season, Smith did not establish himself as a first team regular, but in 200203 became a fans' favourite. However, 200304 saw York relegated to the Conference National, and after being released by the club he spent a season with Stafford Rangers in the Conference North. In 2005, Smith joined their divisional rivals Worcester City, and in 200607 was named the club's Player of the Year. After a third season at Worcester, in which he was captain, the club was re allocated to play in the Conference South. Smith signed for Tamworth in 2008, winning the Conference North title in 200809, and thus promotion to the Conference Premier. After serving 200910 as captain, he signed for Tamworth's divisional rivals Mansfield Town in 2010. Later that year, he rejoined Conference Premier club York, initially on loan, and was immediately appointed captain. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final and 2012 Conference Premier play off Final, both staged at Wembley Stadium, the latter seeing the club promoted to League Two. Having helped York avoid relegation in 201213, he fell out of favour the following season, joining Conference Premier club F.C. Halifax Town in 2014. Smith spent 201415 with Alfreton Town, including a loan spell back at Tamworth. Born in Derby, Derbyshire, Smith began his career in Leeds United's youth system as a schoolboy having been spotted playing for a local junior team in Derby. After being released by Leeds he joined Reading's youth system aged 15, spending three years as a trainee before signing a professional contract on 22 June 1999. Smith had a two match trial with Third Division club York City at the end of the 200001 season, impressing manager Terry Dolan. With him due to be released by Reading, Smith signed for York on 26 May 2001 on a two year contract. He made his first team debut as a 75th minute substitute for Matt Hocking in a 32 home defeat against Exeter City on 6 October 2001. Smith made his first start for York in the following match, a 30 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 13 October 2001, Dolan describing his performance as the one bright spot from the match. However, following York's 41 away defeat by Kidderminster Harriers on 23 October 2001, Dolan placed the blame on the team's inexperienced defence. He did not feature in the team again until being recalled for an FA Cup first round 00 draw away to Colchester United on 17 November 2001. According to the Evening Press, Smith gave a near faultless display when York beat his former club Reading 20 at home in the FA Cup second round on 8 December 2001. He was forced to miss the Christmas period with a virus, which resulted in him losing his place in the team, with Mike Basham, Gary Hobson and Hocking forming solid partnership. After being sent off for the first time in his career in a 30 defeat away to Rushden Diamonds on 19 January 2002, he received a one match suspension. Smith was substituted at half time in York's 11 away draw with Halifax Town on 12 February 2002 due to a tight hamstring, returning over two months later in a 30 home victory over Bristol Rovers on 16 April. Having failed to establish himself as a first team regular, Smith finished 200102 with 19 appearances for York. He started 200203 well, taking his place in the team due to injuries to other players. He made his first appearance in the opening match, a 11 draw away to Macclesfield Town on 10 August 2002, with chairman John Batchelor claiming Smith had a wonderful game and if we can get that sort of attitude from everyone in the team we won't have any problems . Smith was dropped to the bench for a 11 home draw with Wrexham on 29 October 2002 due to a change in formation, having started every match in 200203 prior to this match, although he did play as a 48th minute substitute. He suffered a hamstring injury in early November 2002, making his return in a 10 victory away to Rochdale on 23 November. Smith received his first red card of 200203 for a second bookable offence in a 11 home draw with Hull City on 28 December 2002, resulting in a one match suspension. This meant he missed York's match against Torquay on 11 January 2003, and after a short spell on the sidelines returned in a 21 home win over Macclesfield on 2 February. Smith finished 200203 with 39 appearances for York, and was described by the Evening Press as the surprise star of the season . Despite being in outstanding form and becoming a fans' favourite, he was not offered a new contract with York at the end of 200203 by Dolan, although he hoped to still to have a future at the club. This decision was reversed by newly appointed player manager Chris Brass, and Smith signed a new one year contract in July 2003. Smith underwent a hernia operation in the close season, but due to swelling and bruising around the bone his return was delayed and was an unused substitute for York's first match of 200304. He made his first appearance of the season as a second half substitute for the injured Brass in a 20 defeat away to Bury on 30 September 2003, although Smith commented that It was my first appearance but unfortunately it was not one to remember . Due to injuries to other players, his first start of 200304 came in a 21 defeat away to Halifax in the Football League Trophy first round Northern section on 14 October 2003. This was followed by his first league start four days later in a 11 home draw with Boston, and York went on a seven match unbeaten run in the league with Smith in defence alongside Brass and Richard Hope. He received his fifth yellow card of the season in a 21 away win over Rochdale on 28 December 2003, meaning he was suspended for York's match against Northampton Town on 17 January 2004. Smith was dropped for York's match against Scunthorpe on 9 March 2004 after failing to be vocal and organisational in defence in a 41 defeat away to Kidderminster three days earlier, which was expected of him due to Brass' absence. His return came in a 00 draw against Torquay on 13 March 2004, with Brass praising his performance. After York's relegation to the Conference National was confirmed in April 2004, it was announced that Smith would be released in the summer, despite having been verbally offered a new contract over a month before. He finished 200304 with 30 appearances. Smith dropped into non League football after signing for Conference North club Stafford Rangers in the summer of 2004. He suffered with a knee injury in September 2004 and had an operation in October. His debut came in a 32 home victory over Stalybridge Celtic on 14 December 2004, scoring his first goal with the winner in a 10 victory away to Moor Green on 19 April 2005. He finished 200405 with 23 appearances and one goal for Stafford. Smith joined Stafford's Conference North rivals Worcester City on 25 May 2005, manager Andy Preece calling him the best centre half in the league by far . His debut came in the opening match of 200506, a 21 defeat away to Kettering Town on 13 August 2005, in which he performed impressively. He scored his first Worcester goal in a 21 home victory over Gainsborough Trinity on 20 August 2005, looping the ball over goalkeeper Jamie Holmshaw. Following this, Smith was described by the Worcester News as the team's stand out performer in the first eight days of the campaign . He missed Worcester's matches against Droylsden and Harrogate Town with an ankle injury sustained in a 22 away draw with Workington on 26 August 2005, making his return in a 10 home defeat by Hucknall Town on 10 September 2005. He played in a 10 home defeat by League One team Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup second round on 4 December 2005. Smith picked up an injury to his left knee during a 11 draw away to Stafford on 26 December 2005, with the bone bruising along with a tear to the posterior cruciate. He returned as a 79th minute substitute in a 10 victory away to Northwich Victoria on 11 February 2006. Smith was made captain for the final match of the season, a 30 victory away to Worksop Town on 29 April 2006, and according to the Worcester News he anchored his side expertly from the back . He made 40 appearances and scored four goals for Worcester in 200506. Smith committed his future to the club over the summer of 2006 and captained the team during the 200607 pre season. His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 10 victory away to Barrow on 12 August 2006, before scoring from inside the six yard box in a 20 victory away to Worksop on 22 August. During August 2006, Smith started a spell of playing as a central midfielder after Des Lyttle moved into defence. After receiving his fifth yellow card of the season in a 32 home defeat by Harrogate on 6 October 2006, he was suspended for Worcester's match against Hucknall on 21 October 2006. He signed a new one and a half year contract with Worcester in December 2006, contracting him to the club until the summer of 2008. Smith received a two match suspension after picking up his 10th booking of the season in a 31 home win over Hinckley United on 20 January 2007. This meant he missed matches against Welling United and Scarborough, before scoring on his return in a 33 home draw with Vauxhall Motors on 12 February 2007. He missed a match against Alfreton Town on 9 April 2007 to rest an ankle, despite playing through some previous matches with this complaint. Smith returned in the following match, a 21 home win over Worksop on 14 April 2007, as a 69th minute substitute, despite not being fully fit. He completed 200607 with 47 appearances and five goals, and was named Worcester's Player of the Year. Throughout the season, he often deputised as captain when Lyttle was absent. Smith took over as Worcester captain full time during the 200708 pre season before suffering an ankle injury in July 2007. Despite being doubtful to recover from this injury in time to play in the first match of the season, he started as Worcester were beaten 20 away by Hyde United on 11 August 2007. He suffered a hamstring injury and a recurrence of the ankle injury during this match, meaning he missed Worcester's match against Hinckley on 13 August 2007. He was due to be rested for the following match, a 21 defeat away to Burscough on 18 August 2007, but was brought on as a half time substitute for the injured Adam Burley. His first goal of the season came after heading low into the goal for Worcester's second in a 31 home victory over Leigh RMI on 15 September 2007. After receiving his fifth yellow card of the season in a 21 home win over Stalybridge on 10 November 2007, he was suspended for Worcester's match away to Guiseley in the FA Trophy third qualifying round. Smith was sent off for the first time as a Worcester player after being the last man when pulling back Jason Walker when he was through on goal during a 11 home draw with Barrow on 1 December 2007. This resulted in him being suspended for Worcester's match against Boston on 15 December 2007. He returned in the next match, a 10 victory away to Harrogate on 22 December 2007. Worcester's Conference North rivals A.F.C. Telford United had a bid of 1,500 and a small additional payment for Smith rejected in January 2008, which Worcester manager Richard Dryden labelled as derisory . A.F.C. Telford made a second bid, and if this had been successful, Smith would have become the club's record signing, as the eventual payment would have exceeded the 5,000 paid for Lee Moore in 2006. Worcester rejected A.F.C. Telford's second bid of 5,000, which would have potentially risen to a figure believed to be around 7,000 based on appearances, on 31 January 2008. He received his 10th yellow card of the season during a 10 defeat away to Stalybridge on 22 March 2008, resulting in a two match suspension. His return came in a 60 defeat away to Blyth Spartans on 12 April 2008, before playing in the second leg of the Worcestershire Senior Cup final against Redditch, which Worcester lost 20 on the day and 21 on aggregate. The 200708 season, which Smith said was the worst of his career to date due to the injuries suffered throughout, saw him make 34 appearances and score three goals. Having not wanted to play in the Conference South following Worcester's re allocation into this division, Smith signed for Conference North club Tamworth on 28 May 2008. Gary Mills, the Tamworth manager, had previously tried to sign him for Notts County and Alfreton Town. He made his Tamworth debut in a 11 draw with Droylsden on 9 August 2008, before scoring his first goal in a 21 victory away to King's Lynn on 21 October after the ball fell to him from a corner kick in a crowded penalty area. An undiagnosed groin problem meant Smith missed Tamworth's match against Hinckley on 26 December 2008, although he returned for the following match, a 51 defeat away to Gateshead on 11 January 2009. He was forced into a late withdrawal from Tamworth's match against Burton Albion in the Birmingham Senior Cup on 13 January 2009 after his groin problem reappeared during the warm up. His return to the team came on 24 January 2009 in a 21 victory away to Hyde, during which he conceded a penalty kick after fouling Chris Simm. Smith finished 200809 with Tamworth winning the Conference North title, thus earning promotion to the Conference Premier. He was named the club's Players' Player of the Season, having made 42 appearances and scored two goals in the process. Following the confirmation of Tamworth's title victory, he said We deserved to win the league though from day one really and full credit to the lads because they have all been superb . Smith signed a new one year contract with the club in June 2009. Following Martin Foster's departure, Smith was handed the Tamworth captaincy during the 200910 pre season, which he described as a massive honour . His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 11 draw away to Stevenage Borough on 8 August 2009. Smith's first goal of the season came after scoring a powerful header in a 21 home victory over Wrexham on 25 August 2009. In October 2009, he paid tribute to the defensive partnership he had struck up with Michael Briscoe, saying Football is about partnerships on the pitch, having trust in team mates and good understandings and we seem to have one. Smith suffered a heel injury in October 2009, while also having a hernia problem that possibly needed an operation. After having a hernia operation, he was expected to be ruled out for a long term period, but returned two weeks later in the following match, a 31 home win over Chester City on 14 November 2009. He was handed a one match suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in a 00 home draw with Forest Green Rovers on 28 December 2009, meaning he missed Tamworth's match against Oxford United on 16 January 2010. His return came in a 00 draw away to Gainsborough in the FA Trophy second round on 19 January 2010. After receiving a yellow card in a 10 defeat away to Histon on 9 March 2010, he was given a two match suspension, returning in a 20 away defeat by Cambridge United on 24 March. He scored from close range in the 82nd minute for Tamworth's equalising goal in his first match against York since leaving the club, which finished a 11 away draw on 27 March 2010. Smith made 38 appearances and scored four goals in 200910. Having been disappointed by the new contract offered to him by Tamworth, Smith agreed on 25 May 2010 to join fellow Conference Premier team Mansfield Town on a one year contract. He made his debut in a 31 home victory over Forest Green on 14 August 2010, the opening day of 201011, and his first goal came from a close range header as Mansfield beat Eastbourne Borough 40 at home on 25 September. He was Mansfield's stand in captain for a 11 away draw with Gateshead on 2 October 2010. However, after Mansfield signed defenders Rhys Day and Simon Grand, Smith became surplus to requirements and was made available on loan. Following Mills' appointment as manager at York City, Smith signed for his former club, by this time still playing in the Conference Premier, on 21 October 2010 on a three month loan with a view to a permanent transfer. The move came after making 15 appearances and scoring one goal for Mansfield by that point in 201011. He was immediately installed as captain on his return and made his second debut as a York player in a 20 win away to Kidderminster in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round on 23 October 2010. After receiving his fifth yellow card of the season in a 00 draw away to League Two team Rotherham United in the FA Cup first round, he was handed a one match suspension. Smith's return was marked by a goal for York with a header from Michael Rankine's left footed cross in a 30 home win over Rotherham in the replay on 17 November 2010. He signed for the club permanently on 5 January 2011 on a one and a half year contract that would expire in the summer of 2012. His first appearance after joining permanently came three days later in a 20 defeat away to Premier League team Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup third round, which was the first time Smith had faced top flight opposition in his career. After goalkeeper Michael Ingham's 15th minute sending off away to Luton Town on 18 January 2011, Smith played in goal until half time when being replaced by Greg Young, conceding four goals in a 50 defeat. He received a two match suspension after picking up his 10th booking of the season in a 21 home win over Mansfield on 15 March 2011, meaning he missed York's matches against Cambridge and Histon. He returned in a 11 draw away to Kettering on 2 April 2011, before missing York's matches against Darlington and Cambridge in April due to worries involving the birth of his son. He finished 201011 with 30 appearances and one goal for York. Smith's 201112 season kicked off after starting York's opening match, a 21 away victory over Ebbsfleet United on 13 August 2011. During York's 21 defeat away to Tamworth on 10 September 2011, he conceded the opposition's two successfully converted penalty kicks. He was dropped from the starting line up for the subsequent match against Bath City on 13 September 2011, with Jamal Fyfield taking his place in central defence. Smith remained out of the line up until he started a 21 victory away to Stockport County on 1 October 2011, being favoured over Daniel Parslow as the replacement for the suspended David McGurk. He retained his place for the following match, a 62 home victory over Braintree Town on 8 October 2011, despite McGurk returning from suspension. Smith remained in the team until an FA Cup fourth qualifying round match away to Wrexham on 29 October 2011, when he and a number of other players were left out of the starting line up, but was re installed to the team for the 00 home draw match against Wrexham in the league on 5 November. After making a mistake that led to York conceding a goal late on in a 11 draw away to Forest Green on 26 November 2011, he was replaced in the line up by McGurk for the next match at home to Lincoln three days later. This was the start of a second extended spell out of the team for Smith that season, before returning to play as a defensive midfielder in a 352 formation for York's FA Trophy first round replay away to Solihull Moors on 13 December 2011. He scored his first goal of the season in the 11th minute of this match, converting Scott Kerr's cross at the far post, with York going on to win 30. However, he returned to the bench for the subsequent league match against Kidderminster on 19 December 2011, with York reverting to their usual 433 formation. With York reverting to 352 for a 11 draw away to Mansfield on 26 December 2011, Smith returned as a defensive midfielder, but after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season was suspended for the reverse fixture at home to Mansfield on 1 January 2012. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, with Newport County being beaten 20. This was the first time York had won a national knockout competition. Eight days later, he captained York to a 21 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play off Final at Wembley Stadium, meaning the club regained Football League status after eight years with promotion to League Two. Smith started York's match away to Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup first round in the opening match of 201213 on 11 August 2012, which the team lost 42 in a penalty shoot out following a 11 draw after extra time. He played in York's first Football League fixture since their promotion, a 31 defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. His first goal of the season came three days later with a header in a 22 away draw with Morecambe. Smith scored York's goal in a 10 win away to Dagenham Redbridge on 27 April 2013, as York avoided relegation on the final day of the season, with an eight yard shot after collecting the ball from Michael Ingham's long free kick. He finished the season with 50 appearances and four goals and rejected interest from a League One club to sign a new one year contract with York in May 2013. Smith left York by mutual consent on 28 January 2014 having struggled to break into the team in the previous weeks. He signed for F.C. Halifax Town of the Conference Premier on 23 February 2014 on a short term contract. His debut came as a 70th minute substitute for Adam Smith in a 20 home win over Tamworth on 1 March 2014. Smith's first start for Halifax did not come until 5 April 2014, in which he scored an 85th minute winner in a 10 away win over Nuneaton Town with a header from a corner kick. He remained in the starting line up for the remainder of 201314, and played in both play off semi final matches against Cambridge, in which Halifax were eliminated 21 on aggregate. Smith signed for Conference Premier club Alfreton Town on 11 July 2014 on a one year contract. He made his debut in a 31 home defeat to Woking on the opening day of 201415 on 9 August 2014. Having not played regularly for Alfreton, Smith returned to Tamworth on loan for the rest of the season on 6 March 2015. He made his second debut for Tamworth in their 60 away defeat Chorley in the Conference North on 28 March 2015, and finished the loan spell with five appearances. Smith was not retained by Alfreton for 201516, having made nine appearances as they were relegated in 21st place in the Conference Premier. In December 2015, Smith joined East Midlands Counties League club South Normanton Athletic. He signed for Heanor Town of the Midland League Premier Division in June 2016. He spent the 201718 season with Pinxton in the Central Midlands League South Division before retiring from playing. He won the Central Midlands League Challenge Cup with the club, scoring in the 43 win over Collingham in the final. Smith primarily plays as a centre back. He has been praised for his organisational skills and ability to communicate, Mills describing him in 2010 as somebody on the pitch to organise with a big mouth . He has been recognised for his goalscoring ability for a defender in 2005, he was described by the Worcester News as often a predator in the opposition's penalty box . He has also had spells playing at right back and in defensive midfield in the latter role every attribute he has is geared to that job , said Worcester assistant manager Andy Morrison in 2006. He was described in 2003 by the Evening Press as being cool on the ball, quick in the tackle and strong in the air . After signing for Worcester in 2005, Preece rated him as being good on the ball, aggressive in the air, got a lot of pace and reads the game very well . He was recognised by the Worcester News as a calm and assured presence in defence that breeds confidence throughout the team in 2007. According to the Nottingham Post, he established himself as a tough, uncompromising player with a winning mentality at Tamworth, and these qualities led to Mansfield manager David Holdsworth signing him in 2010. Smith and York teammate Neville Stamp were assaulted by a gang in an unprovoked attack while on a night out in York in August 2001, and after suffering concussion he was admitted to York District Hospital. As part of a scheme by York for forging links with local primary schools, he was involved with Lord Deramore's Primary School. As of 2010, Smith lives in Derbyshire with girlfriend Chantelle. While playing as a semi professional for Stafford, Worcester and Tamworth he combined playing with a plastering career, which he gave up after resuming his professional career with Mansfield.

"Connie Smith born Constance June Meador August 14, 1941 is an American country music artist. She is considered one of the most influential female country artists of all time. Discovered in 1963, Smith signed with RCA Victor Records the following year and remained with the label until 1973. Her debut single Once a Day reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in November 1964 and remained at the top position for eight weeks. The song became Smith's biggest hit and was nominated at the Grammy Awards for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Smith's success continued through 1960s and mid 1970s with nineteen more top ten hits including Then and Only Then , Ain't Had No Lovin' , Cincinnati, Ohio , I Never Once Stopped Loving You and Ain't Love a Good Thing on the country songs chart. In the early 1970s, Smith began recording Gospel music more frequently as she became more serious in her Christianity. As she focused more heavily on religion, Smith became known for her outspoken religious demeanor at concerts and music venues. At the same time, Smith spent more time raising her five children than focusing on music. She eventually went into semi retirement in 1979. Smith would return to recording briefly in the mid 1980s with Epic Records. However, it was not until her collaboration with Marty Stuart in the 1990s that she returned permanently. Their musical friendship would turn romantic, leading to their marriage in 1997. The pairing led to Smith's first studio album in twenty years, Connie Smith. Critically acclaimed, Smith began performing again and has since recorded two more studio albums. Smith has been nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, including eight nominations for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. She has also been nominated for 1 Academy of Country Music award and 3 Country Music Association awards. Rolling Stone included her on their list of the 100 greatest country music artists and CMT ranked her among the top ten in their list of the 40 greatest women of country music. She has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry cast since 1965. In 2012, Smith was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Connie Smith was born Constance June Meador on August 14, 1941, to Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana. Her parents were originally from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there. They would later move to Dungannon, Ohio. Her father was abusive when she was a child, which would eventually cause her to suffer a mental breakdown when she was a teenager. When she was seven, her mother divorced her father and married Tom Clark. Clark brought 8 children to the new marriage Meador brought five, including Smith. The couple would eventually have two more children together, which in total added up to fifteen children. As a child, Smith was surrounded by music. Her stepfather played mandolin, while her brother played fiddle, and her other brother played guitar. On Saturday nights Smith would listen to the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast. While she was a teenager, she was injured in a lawnmower accident, which nearly cut her leg off. While in the hospital recovering, she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords. Following the recovery, she began to perform in various local talent contests. In 1959, Smith graduated from Salem Liberty High School as the class salutatorian. In August 1963, she entered a talent contest at the Frontier Ranch country music park near Columbus, Ohio. Performing Jean Shepard's I Thought of You , Smith won the talent contest and five silver dollars. That day at the park, country artist Bill Anderson heard Smith perform and was impressed by her voice. In January 1964, Smith ran into Anderson again at a country music package concert, where he invited her to perform with him on Ernest Tubb's Midnite Jamboree program in Nashville, Tennessee. After performing on the program, Smith returned to Nashville that May to record demos by Anderson that he planned on pitching to other country artists. Anderson's manager Hubert Long brought the demo recording to RCA Victor Records, where producer Chet Atkins heard it. Also impressed by her vocals, Atkins offered Smith a recording contract, and she eventually signed with the label on June 24, 1964. Because Chet Atkins found himself too busy with other artists, Bob Ferguson acted as Smith's producer on her first sessions and would continue to work as her producer until her departure from RCA. Smith's first session took place on July 16, 1964, where she recorded four songs, three of which were written by Bill Anderson. One of the four songs recorded during the session entitled Once a Day was chosen to be Smith's debut single. The song was rush released as a single on August 1, 1964, and became Smith's breakout single, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart on November 28 and remained at the number one position for eight weeks. Once a Day became the first debut single by a female country artist to reach number one. For nearly 50 years the single held the record for the most weeks spent at number one on the Billboard country chart by a female artist. RCA Victor released Smith's self titled debut album in March 1965 which also reached No. 1, spending seven weeks at the top of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and spending 30 weeks on the chart overall. In addition, the album also peaked at No. 105 on the Billboard 200 albums chart around the same time. Dan Cooper of Allmusic called the production of the album to sound as if she was a down home Streisand fronting The Lennon Sisters. During this time, Anderson wrote a series of singles that would jump start Smith's career in the country music industry. Among these songs was Smith's follow up single to Once a Day released in early 1965 titled Then and Only Then . The song peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard country chart. In addition, its B side, Tiny Blue Transistor Radio originally intended for Skeeter Davis , was also written by Anderson and peaked within the Top 25 on the same singles chart. In 1965 Smith officially became a member of the Grand Ole Opry radio show in Nashville, Tennessee. It had been a dream of Smith's to become a member since childhood, remembering saying at the age of five, Someday Im gonna sing on the Grand Ole Opry. In the mid 60s Smith was temporarily fired from the Grand Ole Opry for not being on the show for twenty six weeks out of the year, which was the required number of weeks to stay a member at the time. In the 1970s, Smith was nearly fired from the show for testifying about Jesus Christ. Bill Anderson wrote her next single with Bette Anderson, which was released in April 1965 called I Can't Remember . The single peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart and No. 30 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart. In October 1965, Smith released her second studio album Cute 'n' Country. The album featured both cover versions of other country songs and newer songs written by Bill Anderson. It included cover versions of songs by such artists as Jim Reeves, Webb Pierce, and Ray Price. Like her first album, Cute 'n' Country reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and spent thirty weeks on the chart as well. Her next two singles, If I Talk to Him and Nobody But a Fool Would Love You , both reached No. 4 on the Hot Country Singles chart and were issued on Smith's third album, Miss Smith Goes to Nashville 1966 . The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. With her next few sessions, Smith's producer Bob Ferguson felt pressured from RCA headquarters in New York City to market Smith's sound toward more middle of the road country pop material. This change of sound was evident on her next two studio albums Born to Sing 1966 and Downtown Country 1967 . Both albums featured full orchestras in the background and cover versions of singles by pop artists of the time. Spawned from Born to Sing and Downtown Country were the singles Ain't Had No Lovin' and The Hurtin's All Over , which both peaked within the Top 5 on the Hot Country Singles chart. During this time, Smith also appeared in several country music vehicle films, where she performed many of her current hit recordings. In 1966, she appeared in the films Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar and The Las Vegas Hillbillys, the latter of which starred Jayne Mansfield. In 1967, she appeared in The Road to Nashville and Hell on Wheels. In February 1967, Smith released an album on RCA Camden entitled Connie in the Country, which mainly featured cover versions of country hits recorded at the time, including songs by Loretta Lynn and Buck Owens. In May 1967 Smith released an album of songs written entirely by Bill Anderson entitled Connie Smith Sings Bill Anderson. She later commented that, ...it was an honor, not a favor to record an album of all Bill Anderson songs. Included in the album was covers of Anderson's own hits such as City Lights and That's What It's Like to Be Lonesome . Also featured was Anderson's I Love You Drops , which Smith wanted to release as a single however Anderson wanted to release the song as his own single. Smith stated, We begged him for that song. But I cut 33 of his songs. It would later become a top ten hit for Anderson. Between 1966 and 1968, Smith had five top ten singles in a row on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart I'll Come Running which Smith wrote herself , Cincinnati, Ohio , Burning a Hole in My Mind , Baby's Back Again , and Run Away Little Tears . Cincinnati, Ohio would later inspire the city of Cincinnati, Ohio to declare their own Connie Smith Day in June 1967. By 1968, Smith began to feel large amounts of pressure from the music business. The stress of touring, recording, promoting, and trying to keep a personal life reportedly led Smith to contemplate suicide but she later stated she never considered the prospect as an actual possibility. These pressures eventually led Smith to seek solace in both her family life and religion, becoming a Born Again Christian in the spring of 1968. Although she did not give up her music career completely, Smith did balance it with a lighter schedule in order to avoid stress. In 1968 69, she began to record darker songs, including the single Ribbon of Darkness , among others. Smith stated that it was reflection on her personal life, after recently divorcing her first husband Jerry Smith. Despite her recent personal troubles, Smith continued to enjoy the same commercial success she had before. In 1969 her next single You and Your Sweet Love written by Bill Anderson reached No. 6 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. This was followed by another top ten single in 1970, entitled I Never Once Stopped Loving You , which reached No. 5 on the same singles chart. Between 1969 and 1970, she released two collaborative albums with American country artist Nat Stuckey called Young Love and Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith, the latter of which was a gospel album. From 1970 to 1971, both the singles Louisiana Man and Where Is My Castle became top 20 hits on the Billboard Magazine country singles chart. In 1971, Smith's cover of Don Gibson's 1960 single Just One Time reached No. 2 on the Hot Country Singles chart. An album of the same name was also released, which reached No. 20 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. By the early 1970s, Smith started to incorporate more Gospel music into her regular studio albums and touring show. Smith later stated that by incorporating more Gospel music into her secular recording career would make her leap into Christianity count . In 1971, she released her third gospel album, Come Along and Walk with Me, which Smith later stated was her favorite gospel record out of the many she has made. In 1972, all three of Smith's singles reached the top ten on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart Just for What I Am 5 , If It Ain't Love Let's Leave It Alone 7 , and Love Is the Look You're Looking for 8 . In addition, three albums were also released to accommodate the success of the three singles, including a tribute to songwriter Dallas Frazier named If It Ain't Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs. In November 1972, Smith announced she would depart from RCA the same week that country artist Eddy Arnold also announced his temporary departure. Smith later explained in an interview with Razor Tie that she felt RCA showed a lack of respect for her and she felt she would have been happier recording elsewhere. After parting ways with RCA, Smith moved to Columbia Records in 1973. With her new contract, she insisted that she would be able to record one gospel album a year. She released her first gospel album under the label in November 1973, entitled God Is Abundant. In addition, the label also gave her the advantage of being able to incorporate more gospel songs into her regular country studio albums. Because of these factors, most of her singles remained out of the top ten, but she did manage to stay in the top 20 most of the decade. That year Smith recorded her first country album for the label entitled A Lady Named Smith with producer George Richey. Smith and Richey co wrote the album's lead single, You've Got Me Right Where You Want Me , which became a minor hit on the Billboard country chart. However Smith was dissatisfied with Richey's production strategies and replaced him with Ray Baker for her next album, That's the Way Love Goes 1974 . Her next single released on That's the Way Love Goes was written by Dallas Frazier called Ain't Love a Good Thing , which peaked at No. 10 on the Hot Country Singles Chart in 1974. After signing with Columbia, many music critics considered that Smith lost much of the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor. When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits 1997 , Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the grain in her voice. Jurek went on to write, It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style. In 1974 Smith released the singles I Never Knew What That Song Meant Before and I've Got My Baby on My Mind , which both reached No. 13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. In 1975, she released her second gospel album with the label, entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel, which was a tribute to the gospel material that Hank Williams recorded. That year, she also released a cover of Williams' secular Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do as a single. In 1976, Smith released two cover versions of previously made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles Till I Kissed You and So Sad To Watch Good Love Go Bad . In 1977 Smith moved to Monument Records. With her new recording contract, she was marketed as a country pop artist and was pressured into recording softer material. While reviewing Smith's 1993 Monument compilation Greatest Hits on Monument, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that she not only recorded country pop material, but also heavily produced adult contemporary ballads and big, shiny disco influenced pop numbers. Meanwhile, both of Smith's albums under the label stiffed upon release. Her debut 1977 Monument album, Pure Connie Smith, only spawned one single, entitled Coming Around , which peaked outside the Top 40. Only one single released on the label became a significant hit, a cover of Andy Gibb's 1977 pop hit I Just Want to Be Your Everything , which peaked at No. 14 on the country singles chart in 1978. Her next five singles on the label continued to descend into progressively lower positions on the country singles chart and because of poor record sales, Smith decided to go into semi retirement in 1979 to raise her five children. Smith was encouraged to restart her mainstream career in 1985 with a new recording contract to Epic Records. The label released two singles over the course of two years. The first single, A Far Cry from You 1985 , was written by Alternative country artist Steve Earle and reached No. 71 on the Hot Country Singles chart. The second single did not chart and Epic failed to release any further singles or an album. In 1986, she made a cameo appearance in Stephen King's horror film Maximum Overdrive as dead lady in car . One day in the mid 1990s, Smith was at her home talking to one of her daughters on the phone. After telling her mother what she was going to do that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart whom she later married in 1997 , acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self titled studio album. It consisted of ten tracks, nine of them co written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream . Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it a solid effort , also commenting, ...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer. Also in 1998, Smith made a second cameo appearance in a film, portraying a Singer at the Rodeo Dance in The Hi Lo Country starring Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup. In August 2003, she released a collaborative gospel album with country artists Barbara Fairchild and Sharon White called Love Never Fails on Daywind Records. In an interview with Country Stars Central, Smith said that she was ill with the stomach flu while recording the album, but, still enjoyed making the record, Produced by country and bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs White's husband , the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards. The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans who really like tinkly pianos and less twangy vocals , and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, for folks who are fans any of these three singers, this is kind of a treat. In November of 2008, Smith joined the cast of Marty Stuart's television series The Marty Stuart Show, which airs on the RFD TV network every Saturday night. The thirty minute program features traditional country music performed by both Stuart and Smith, as well as radio personality Eddie Stubbs. Since 2008, Smith had been writing new songs for her next album. In August Smith released her first new solo recording in thirteen years, entitled Long Line of Heartaches via Sugar Hill Records. The record was produced by Marty Stuart and includes five songs written by the pair. Harlan Howard, Kostas, Johnny Russell, and Dallas Frazier also wrote songs that were included on the album. In 2012, Smith was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Connie Smith's sound is defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, primarily during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as sharp and prominent . Her steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called The Connie Smith Sound . In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer Bob Ferguson wanted the guitar to sound, He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls. I thought it was an awfully thin sound, but it wound up being very popular. Smith is considered by many critics and historians to be one of country music's most celebrated and respected artists. In his review of Smith's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith, Jurek explained why Smith's vocals are usually compared to Cline's, Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline's throne. It's not that there aren't many amazing vocalists in the field, and plenty of legends among them. But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction, Smith is it. Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography. Elvis Presley had many of Smith's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith's version of The Wonders You Perform , but never got around to doing so. In a discussion with country songwriter Fred Foster, Dolly Parton famously said, You know, there's really only three female singers in the world Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, and Connie Smith. The rest of us are only pretending . Smith has been married four times. In 1961, she married Jerry Smith, a ferroanalyst at the Inter Lake Iron Corporation in Beverly, Ohio. They had one child together, born on March 9, 1963, named Darren Justin. In the late 1970s, Darren went to Europe to become a missionary he is currently a psychologist. In the mid 1960s, the couple divorced and Smith married the guitarist in her touring band, Jack Watkins. They had a son, Kerry Watkins, before separating nearly a year after marrying. Shortly afterward, Smith married telephone repairman Marshall Haynes. In the early 1970s, Haynes frequently toured with Connie on her road show. The couple had three daughters Jeanne, Julie, and Jodi Haynes. After divorcing Haynes in the early 1990s, Smith stated that she would never marry again. However, on July 8, 1997, she did get married for the fourth time, this time to her producer, country artist Marty Stuart. Stuart began producing her after writing songs for Smith's 1998 comeback album. Stuart described encountering Smith 26 years earlier, after attending her concert I met Connie when I was 12 years old. She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown Philadelphia, Mississippi to work at a fair. She hasn't changed a bit. She looked great then and she looks great now. Stuart said he told his mother then that he was going to marry Connie Smith. Smith explains how they have sustained their marriage Make the Lord the center ... and commit. Smith has won two awards from both Billboard Magazine and Cash Box. Besides her nominations from music magazines, she has been nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, one award from the Academy of Country Music, and three awards from the Country Music Association, as well as several nominations from the fan voted Music City News Awards including one win.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie%20Smith
"Cyril Stanley Smith 4 October 1903 25 August 1992 was a British metallurgist and historian of science. He is most famous for his work on the Manhattan Project where he was responsible for the production of fissionable metals. A graduate of the University of Birmingham and Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT , Smith worked for many years as a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company. During World War II he worked in the Chemical Metallurgical Division of the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he purified, cast and shaped uranium 235 and plutonium, a metal hitherto available only in microgram amounts, and whose properties were largely unknown. After the war he served on the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, and the President's Science Advisory Committee. Smith founded the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first interdisciplinary academic organization devoted to the study of metals in the United States. He studied the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. In 1961, he moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. He applied the techniques of metallurgy to the study of the production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords. Smith was born in Birmingham, England, on 4 October 1903, the third of four children of Joseph Seymour Smith, a commercial traveller for Camp Coffee, and his wife, Frances, nee Norton. He was educated at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. He read metallurgy at the University of Birmingham, having not met the requirements in mathematics to study his first choice, which was physics, and was awarded a second class BSc in 1924. That year Smith entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT , where he earned a ScD in 1926. He was a research associate at MIT from 1926 to 1927, then left to take up a position as a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company. His research there was mainly involved with the electrical, thermal, and mechanical and magnetic properties of copper alloys. He published numerous papers, and was awarded 20 patents. He married Alice Marchant Kimball, a student of English social history at Yale University, from which she earned a PhD in 1936, on 16 March 1931. Of the marriage, Alice's sister remarked that If he didn't go to Oxford or Cambridge, isn't Church of England, and doesn't like sports, you might as well marry an American . He became a naturalized American citizen in 1939. His wife sparked an interest in history, a subject that he had disliked at school. He acquired old texts, and in 1945 he produced a translation of a classic metallurgical text, Vannocio Biringuccio's Pirotechnia 1540 . In 1942, during World War II, he was called into service at the War Metallurgy Committee in Washington, D.C. In April 1943 he went to work on the Manhattan Project, joining the Chemical Metallurgical Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory as the head of its Metallurgy Group. When the laboratory was reorganized in April 1944, he became the Associate Division Leader in charge of metallurgy. His first task was recruiting metallurgists, who were in great demand by the war effort. He also had to arrange for the transport of their metallurgical equipment to Los Alamos under wartime conditions. Smith's metallurgists found ways of fabricating boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat treating steel. They also had to work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large scale process for producing pure uranium metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, when and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure uranium metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process. But by far the biggest challenge for Smith and his group was plutonium, a metal hitherto available only in microgram amounts, and whose properties were largely unknown. It was initially assumed that plutonium would have properties similar to that of uranium, but this assumption turned out to be invalid. Plutonium proved to be the most complicated metal known to man . There were found to be six allotropes of plutonium, more than any other metal, and its melting point turned out to be hundred of degrees lower than uranium. The metallurgists found that at around 125 C, plutonium expanded in volume by 20 percent, which is unusual. Plutonium was delivered to Los Alamos in the form of what was found to be a mixture of plutonium trifluoride PuF3 and plutonium tetrafluoride PuF4 . Work with plutonium was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons. The metallurgists figured out how to purify the plutonium, and found that heating it to 250 allowed them to work it in the malleable phase. It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the phase. When plutonium at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. In a race against the clock, the metallurgists produced plutonium spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by 23 July 1945. Smith was awarded the Medal for Merit by President Harry S. Truman for these activities in 1946. After the war Smith founded the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first interdisciplinary academic organization devoted to the study of metals in the United States. He considered it a natural outgrowth of the close association of metallurgists with chemists and physicists on the Manhattan Project. He developed methods for deriving the three dimensional shapes of the crystalline structures of metals from the two dimensional microscope images of the grains of the metals. He also studied the propagation of induced phase changes in metals. He was fascinated by the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. Perhaps his most influential paper was on Grain Shapes and Other Metallurgical Applications of Topology 1952 , an explanation of metallic microstructure. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955 to study the History of Science and Technology. From 12 December 1946 to 10 January 1952, Smith served on the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission AEC . Chaired by Robert Oppenheimer, the wartime director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the General Advisory Committee provided policy as well as technical advice to the commissioners. One of Smith's first papers for the commission recommended that it concentrate on the development of fast breeder reactors and high flux reactors. A 1948 visit to England to discuss plutonium metallurgy with British scientists nearly escalated into an international incident, as Senator Bourke Hickenlooper and Secretary of Defense James Forrestal feared that he would give atomic secrets away to the British. Smith did no such thing but AEC Commissioner Sumner Pike faced severe criticism for authorizing Smith's visit. In common with other members of the General Advisory Committee, Smith opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb on technical and moral grounds. He also served on the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy and the President's Science Advisory Committee. In 1961, Smith moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into the study of the production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC. Smith received numerous awards, including the Franklin Institute's Francis J. Clamer Medal in 1952, and the History of Science Society's Pfizer Medal and American Society for Metals' Gold Medal in 1961. He was awarded the Society for the History of Technology's Leonardo da Vinci Medal in 1966, and the Institute of Metals' Platinum Medal in 1970. In 1981, Cyril Stanley Smith received the Dexter Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society. In 1991 he received the American Institute of Physics' Andrew Gemant Award for pioneering the use of solid state physics in the study of ancient art and artefacts to reconstruct their cultural, historical and technological significance. He was also a member of the editorial board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. On retirement from MIT in 1969, Smith became a professor emeritus of the History of Science and Technology, professor emeritus of Metallurgy and Humanities and Institute Professor Emeritus, an unusual title reserved for only a few whose work transcends the boundaries of traditional departments and disciplines . He died of colonic cancer in his Cambridge, Massachusetts home on 25 August 1992. He was survived by his wife of sixty years, Alice Kimball Smith, his two children, Anne Smith Denman, chair of the Department of Anthropology at Central Washington University, and Stuart Marchant Smith, a marine geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a sister, Mary Smith. His papers are in the Niels Bohr Library in College Park, Maryland. His collection of antiquarian metallurgical texts was left to the Burndy Library at the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril%20Stanley%20Smith
"Dean Edwards Smith February 28, 1931 February 7, 2015 was an American men's college basketball head coach. Called a coaching legend by the Basketball Hall of Fame, he coached for 36 years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Smith coached from 1961 to 1997 and retired with 879 victories, which was the NCAA Division I men's basketball record at that time. Smith had the 9th highest winning percentage of any men's college basketball coach 77.6 . During his tenure as head coach, North Carolina won two national championships and appeared in 11 Final Fours. Smith played college basketball at the University of Kansas, where he won a national championship in 1952 playing for Hall of fame coach Phog Allen. Smith was best known for running a clean program and having a high graduation rate, with 96.6 of his athletes receiving their degrees. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott, and pushing for equal treatment for African Americans by local businesses. Smith coached and worked with numerous people at North Carolina who achieved notable success in basketball, as players, coaches, or both. Smith retired in 1997, saying that he was not able to give the team the same level of enthusiasm that he had given it for years. After retiring, Smith used his influence to help various charitable ventures and liberal political activities, but in his latter years he suffered from advanced dementia and ceased most public activities. Dean Smith was born in Emporia, Kansas, on February 28, 1931. Both of his parents were public school teachers. Smith's father, Alfred, coached the Emporia High Spartans basketball team to the 1934 state title in Kansas. This 1934 team was notable for having the first African American basketball player in Kansas tournament history. While at Topeka High School, Smith lettered in basketball all four years and was named all state in basketball as a senior. Smith's interest in sports was not limited only to basketball. Smith also played quarterback for his high school football team and catcher for the high school baseball team. After graduating from high school, Smith attended the University of Kansas on an academic scholarship where he majored in mathematics and joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. While at Kansas, Smith continued his interest in sports by playing varsity basketball, varsity baseball, and freshman football, and was a member of the Air Force ROTC detachment. During his time on the varsity basketball team, Kansas won the national championship in 1952 and were NCAA tournament finalists in 1953. Smith's basketball coach during his time at Kansas was Phog Allen, who had been coached at the University of Kansas by the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. After graduation, Smith served as assistant coach at Kansas in the 195354 season. Smith next served a stint in the United States Air Force in Germany, later working as a head coach of United States Air Force Academy's baseball and golf teams. Yet, Smith's big break would come in the United States. In 1958, North Carolina coach Frank McGuire asked Smith to join his staff as an assistant coach. Smith served under McGuire for three years until 1961, when McGuire was forced to resign by Chancellor William Aycock in the wake of a major recruiting scandal, and consequently, an NCAA mandated probation. Years later, Aycock recalled that McGuire came to his office on a Saturday and told him he was resigning. Smith was waiting in McGuire's car outside South Building UNC's main administration building , so Aycock called him in and asked him if he wanted to take over as head coach. Smith accepted, and the hiring was formally announced the following Monday. When Aycock named Smith as head coach, he told the 30 year old Smith that wins and losses didn't matter as much as running a clean program and representing the university well. The Atlantic Coast Conference ACC had canceled the Dixie Classic, an annual basketball tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina, due to a national point shaving scandal including a North Carolina player Lou Brown . As a result of the scandal, North Carolina de emphasized basketball by cutting their regular season schedule. In Smith's first season, North Carolina played only 17 games and went 8 9. This was the only losing season he endured during his career. In 1965, he was famously hanged in effigy on the university campus following a disappointing loss to Wake Forest. After that game, UNC would win nine of their last eleven games, and Smith would subsequently go on to turn the program into a consistent success. From 1965 66 onward, Smith's teams never finished worse than tied for third in the ACC. For the first 21 of those years, they did not finish worse than a tie for second. By comparison, during that time the ACC's other charter members each finished last at least once. His first major successes came in the late 1960s, when his teams won consecutive regular season and ACC tournament championships, and went to three straight Final Fours, going all the way to the national championship game in 1968. They would appear in either the NCAA or NIT in every one of Smith's final 31 years in Chapel Hill. However, this run occurred in the middle of UCLA's stretch of 10 titles in 12 years, and in fact Smith lost to UCLA's John Wooden in the 1968 title game. Smith's first national championship occurred with his 198182 team, which was composed of future NBA players such as Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins. After winning the NCAA Tournament, North Carolina had a record of 32 2. The other teams that advanced with North Carolina were Georgetown, Houston and Louisville. The Tar Heels actually finished in a tie for first in the ACC regular season with the Ralph Sampson led Virginia Cavaliers. In the semifinals, North Carolina defeated Houston 68 63 in New Orleans, while Georgetown defeated Louisville 50 46. The national title game against Georgetown was evenly matched throughout. However, with 17 seconds left on the clock, and the Tar Heels behind by 1 point, Jordan made what ended up being the game winning shot to put the Tar Heels up 63 62. On Georgetown's ensuing possession, Hoya guard Fred Brown inexplicably passed the ball directly to Worthy with no Georgetown player anywhere near the pass. Worthy attempted to dribble out the clock, but was fouled with 2 seconds left. He missed both free throws, but Georgetown had no timeouts left. The Hoyas missed a halfcourt shot as time expired, giving Smith his first national championship in his seventh appearance in the Final Four. Dean Smith's 199293 squad featured George Lynch, Eric Montross, Brian Reese, Donald Williams, and Derrick Phelps. The Tar Heels started out with an 8 0 record and were ranked 5 in the country when they met 6 Michigan in the semi finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79 78 on a last second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back to back road games against unranked Wake Forest and 5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked 1 heading into the last week of the regular season their first 1 ranking since the start of the 198788 season . North Carolina beat 14 Wake Forest and 6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77 75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, defeating 16 seed East Carolina 85 65 , 8 seed Rhode Island 112 67 , 4 seed Arkansas 80 74 and 2 seed Cincinnati 75 68 to reach the Final Four in New Orleans. In the National Semifinals, Smith's Tar Heels defeated his alma mater Kansas coached by future North Carolina coach Roy Williams 78 68. In 1991, the same two teams also met in the National Semifinals with Kansas prevailing and Dean Smith being ejected. The 1993 victory for UNC set up a rematch from earlier that season with 3 ranked Michigan in the Finals. The 1993 national title game was a see saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time out that Michigan didn't have with seconds left and Michigan trailing by only 2. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77 71, giving Smith his second national championship due to an unforced error or intentional give away by the opposing team. After a six year investigation by the NCAA, Webber's association and financial dealings with Ed Martin determined that there had been a series of violations and direct payments to players and was termed the University of Michigan basketball scandal and resulted in Michigan pulling down all of its banners and titles from that era. Smith announced his retirement on October 9, 1997. He had said that if he ever felt he could not give his team the same enthusiasm he had given it for years, he would retire. His announcement was unexpected, as he had given little warning that he was considering retirement. Smith had been the only coach that a generation of Tar Heel fans had ever known. Bill Guthridge, his assistant for 30 years, succeeded him as head coach. During his retirement, Smith had a large influence on the North Carolina basketball program. In 2003 Smith talked to Roy Williams regarding his decision about whether or not to replace a struggling Matt Doherty as head coach. Williams had previously declined the head coaching position three years earlier when Guthridge retired. In July 2010, John Feinstein disclosed that he had planned to write a biography of Smith, but had to shelve it due to Smith's deteriorating memory. Shortly after, Smith's family released a letter on July 17, 2010, stating that he had a progressive neurocognitive disorder , which has not been publicly disclosed as Alzheimer's or anything else. He had trouble remembering the names of some of his players, the letter said, but he could not forget what his relationships with those players meant. He also remembered words to hymns and jazz standards, but did not go to concerts. He had difficulty with traveling but continued to watch his former team on TV. Williams said, He does have his good days and bad. Smith coached teams varied in style, depending on the players Smith had available. But they generally featured a fast break style, a half court offense that emphasized the passing game, and an aggressive trapping defense that produced turnovers and easy baskets. From 1970 until his retirement, his teams featured an impressive shooting percentage of over 50 in all but four years. Smith was credited with creating or popularizing the following basketball techniques The tired signal, in which a player would use a hand signal originally a raised fist to indicate that he needed to come out for a rest, huddling at the free throw line before a foul shot, encouraging players who scored a basket to point a finger at the teammate who passed them the ball, in honor of the passer's selflessness, instituting a variety of defensive sets in one game, having the point guard call out the defense set for the team, and creating a number of defensive sets, including the point zone, the run and jump, and double teaming the screen and roll. But strategically, Smith was most associated with his implementation of John McLendon's four corners offense, a strategy for stalling with a lead near the end of the game. Smith's teams executed the four corners set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best selling technical basketball book in history. Smith also instituted the practice of starting all his team's seniors on the last home game of the season Senior Day as a way of honoring the contributions of the subs as well as the stars. In a season when the team included six seniors, he put all six on the floor at the beginning of the game drawing a technical foul rather than leave one of them out. During the 1993 run for the national title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him at a conference in Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers. Student athletes under Smith achieved a graduation rate of 96.6 at North Carolina, and he established a reputation for running a clean program. Although athletes benefited from academic improprieties at the university during Smith's reign, there is no evidence that Smith was aware of the practice. Dean Smith married Ann Cleavinger in 1954, shortly before his deployment overseas with the United States Air Force. They had three children daughters Sharon and Sandy, and son Scott. Smith and Cleavinger divorced in 1973. Smith married Linnea Weblemoe on May 21, 1976. They have two adult daughters, Kristen and Kelly. Dean Smith died on the evening of February 7, 2015, twenty one days before his 84th birthday, at his Chapel Hill home surrounded by his wife and five children. A private funeral was held on February 12 at Binkley Baptist Church in Chapel Hill, with burial following at Old Chapel Hill Cemetery on the UNC campus. A public memorial service was held at the Dean Smith Center on February 22. He willed a 200 check to each of the former lettermen he coached during his 36 years at North Carolina, which included the message Enjoy a dinner out compliments of Coach Dean Smith. Among the accomplishments of Smith Smith received a number of personal honors during his coaching career. He was named the National Coach of the Year four times 1977, 1979, 1982, 1993 and ACC Coach of the Year eight times 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1988, 1993 . Smith was also inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on May 2, 1983, two years after being enshrined in the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. Smith was the first recipient of the Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by the University of North Carolina Committee on Teaching Awards for a broader range of teaching beyond the classroom. He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by Eastern University and Catawba College. The basketball arena at North Carolina, the Dean Smith Center, was named for Smith. It is also widely referred to as the Dean Dome . Smith coached the last 11.5 years of his career in the arena, making him one of the few college coaches to have coached in an arena or stadium named for him. In 1997, upon his retirement, Smith was named Sportsman of the Year by the magazine Sports Illustrated. ESPN named Smith one of the five all time greatest American coaches of any sport. In 1998, he won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, presented at the annual ESPY Awards hosted by ESPN. On November 17, 2006, Smith was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, John Wooden and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. In 2007, he was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame. On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Dean Smith was one of the most prominent Democrats in North Carolina politics. Politically, he was best known for promoting desegregation. In 1964, Smith joined a local pastor and a black North Carolina theology student to integrate The Pines, a Chapel Hill restaurant. He also integrated the Tar Heels basketball team by recruiting Charlie Scott as the university's first black scholarship athlete. In 1965, Smith helped Howard Lee, a black graduate student at North Carolina, purchase a home in an all white neighborhood. He opposed the Vietnam War and, in the early 1980s, famously recorded radio spots to promote a freeze on nuclear weapons. He has been a prominent opponent of the death penalty. In 1998, he appeared at a clemency hearing for a death row inmate and pointed at then Governor Jim Hunt You're a murderer. And I'm a murderer. The death penalty makes us all murderers. As head coach, he periodically held North Carolina basketball practices in North Carolina prisons. While coach, he was recruited by some in the Democratic Party to run for the United States Senate against incumbent Jesse Helms. He declined. But in retirement, he continued to speak out on issues such as the war in Iraq, death penalty and gay rights. Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States. One hallmark of Dean Smith's tenure as coach was the concept of the Carolina Family, the idea that anyone associated with the program was entitled to the support of others. Many of his former players and coaching staff became successful basketball coaches and executives. Smith's coaching tree includes Smith was part of the coaching tree of James Naismith, by way of playing under Phog Allen at Kansas.

"Dean Cullom Smith September 27, 1899 March 4, 1987 was a pioneer American mail pilot, test pilot, flying instructor, Antarctic pilot, and airline pilot. At 17 years of age, he became the youngest flight instructor in U.S. Army history. He was a lead pilot for the U.S. Postal Service's airmail service, and was the first pilot to initiate night air mail flights. He was an executive for many airlines and aircraft companies. Smith was a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 19281930 involved in aerial overflights to discover new land that could be claimed for the benefit of the United States. The land was later viewed by Byrd and named after his wife. Smith was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Congressional Gold Medal. An Antarctic peak bears his name. He was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation Hall of Fame in 1986. Smith was born in Cove, Oregon, on September 27, 1899 at his grandparents home. His parents were Joshua Cullow Smith and Rhoda Harris Smith. When he was three years old he traveled with his family to Central America where his father's business was headquartered. He would often run away from home to go to his grandmother's to hear her talk about the pioneer days of covered wagons. As a child, Smith attended public schools in Oregon. After high school he attended two years at Principia College in St. Louis, Missouri, but did not graduate. Smith enlisted in the aviation Section of the United States Signal Corps in July 1917, several months before his eighteenth birthday. Soon after he enlisted, he was promoted to master signal electrician, the highest non commissioned rank of the US Army Signal Corps. During this time, he was the youngest enlist to serve in the capacity. In this position he was able to promote himself to be a cadet in Ground At 17, Smith became the youngest ever flight instructor in U.S. Army history after receiving just under 57 hours of flying instruction. Though he volunteered to serve overseas to the front lines with the American Expeditionary Forces, he was posted as a flying instructor at Fort Scott. He was promoted to second lieutenant and stayed in the United States for the duration of his service duties. From August 1918 to January 1919, Smith was assigned to Gosport Instructor's School in San Antonio, Texas, as an Army flight instructor. Later he was then transferred to Rockwell Field in San Diego to teach at the Pursuit School of Instruction, where he remained until he was discharged in March 1919. Subsequently, Smith flew as a barnstormer for about a year at carnivals. He also gave five minute rides, for five dollars each, at county fairs in various states during this time. Eventually he destroyed his plane and discontinued these ventures. Smith was instrumental in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service USPS in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way. He became an official air mail pilot on May 21, 1920. He helped to develop a transcontinental route that included the technology of flying using electronic instruments. The next segment he added later was from Cleveland to Chicago and that leg was later extended to Omaha. Flying planes carrying air mail, day or night, was hazardous and accidents happened often, more so even than in barnstorming. Smith worked as an air mail pilot until August 31, 1927. In his association with USPS for more than 7 years, he logged 3764.57 hours and flew 365,719 miles 588,568 km . Smith was permanently stationed at Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, as an air mail pilot starting in May 1920. He often flew from there in and out of Cleveland and used the De Havilland Airco DH 4B aircraft for the delivery of airmail. Smith reported in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, that he had had to ditch into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In the first five years of US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights most deaths were between 1920 and 1925. Smith was involved in another incident that scared him to death. One day when he was flying his normal air mail route from Hadley Field to Cleveland, he caught something out of the corner of his eye that looked like a skyscraper. He pulled back on the control stick to quickly gain altitude and just missed hitting the U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles that was in his direct path. It was a close call of just over a hundred feet. In 1928, Smith was selected as a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 19281930 from a list of over 25,000 pilots. Byrd selected Smith not only for his all weather experience, but because of the respect he had for Smith's mother after meeting her. Smith flew a three engined Ford Trimotor plane named the Floyd Bennett named in Bennett's honor and headed for the South Pole on August 25, 1928. He logged 70 hours of Antarctic flying during the time he was at the South Pole with Admiral Richard Byrd. Smith flew Antarctic missions with Bernt Balchen, a Norwegian, who piloted the first plane to traverse the South Pole. He was a pilot involved in aerial overflights to discover new land in Antarctica that had not been claimed by other countries. One was a Matterhorn like mountain, and surrounding region which was named Marie Byrd Land in honor of Byrd's wife. The mountain range was seen first by Smith before Byrd saw it. Byrd claimed his pet mountain for the United States and a narrative of Byrd's story, and how the land got his wife's name, was published in The New York Times of February 21, 1929. Smith returned from the expedition to his home town in Oregon for a festive welcome on July 21, 1930. Among the many questions the crowd had for him, the one that stood out was a question about the most impressive thing he experienced while at the South Pole. His answer was of the notable silence in the Antarctic. He accounted for this by remarking that no woman had ever been there. Smith went back to the air mail delivery after being at the South Pole for two years with Byrd, even setting a record on the notorious hell stretch over mountains in Pennsylvania. Throughout his career in aviation, Smith worked for various companies such as Learning Curtiss Company, Fairchild Aviation, Hughes Tool Company, Douglas Aircraft Company, American Airlines, and United Airlines at one time or another, in various capacities. He died in Maryland on March 4, 1987. Though he stopped flying commercially in 1943, Smith continued his work with the aircraft and aviation industry. In 1973, he returned to New Zealand after more than 40 years as a guest for Air New Zealand on its first flight of McDonnell Douglas DC 10, this time as a passenger. He also was on board for a landing on the Tasman Glacier, passing through Milford Sound and Mount Cook, New Zealand. Smith was nicknamed The Dean because of his given name. As an adult he was 6 feet 3 inches tall, weighed 180 pounds, and had black hair. He was known as a man of few words. Some claimed his extreme shyness was unexpected, given his large size. Smith married Mrs. Elizabeth Schuyler on January 3, 1931. Smith was a member of the Aero Club of America. He was also a member of several pioneer aviator groups including the Air Mail Pioneers Association and the Quiet Birdmen. He was the last president of the National Air Pilots Association, as it was subsumed in 1932 into the Airline Pilots Association. As a pioneer flier, he was named to the Curtiss OX5 and Aviation Halls of Fame. Smith was decorated in 1930 with the Distinguished Flying Cross for assisting Byrd. He received the Harmon Trophy in 1934 for being America's most outstanding aviator. Smith was also a recipient of The Detroit News Aerial Trophy. He was a featured aviator in Chasing the Sun, a public television documentary on commercial aviation, produced by KCET Hollywood. Smith Peak on Thurston Island, Antarctica, is named for Smith.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean%20Smith%20%28pilot%29
"Denis Smith born 19 November 1947 is an English former professional footballer and manager. He made 531 appearances in all competitions in 15 seasons as a player in the Football League, and as a manager took charge for 1,195 competitive matches. Born in Meir, Stoke on Trent, he joined local club Stoke City as an amateur in 1964, making his first team debut in September 1968. A hard tackling defender, he soon established himself in the first team, playing in a centre back partnership with Alan Bloor for much of his career. Stoke enjoyed one of the most successful periods of their history during his time at the club, as he helped Stoke to win the League Cup in 1972, featuring in successive FA Cup semi finals in 1971 and 1972 and helping the club to successive fifth place finishes in the First Division in 197374 and 197475. His bravery as a player meant that he also entered the Guinness Book of Records as the most injured man in football, although he was never able to fully recover after breaking his leg for the fifth time in his career in March 1975. He did manage to continue to play competitive football, and helped Stoke to win promotion from the Second Division in 197879. He missed the entire 198081 season due to injury, and left the club in May 1982. He began his management career at York City in May 1982, having played for the club on loan the previous season. He led the club to the Fourth Division title in 198384, totalling five seasons at the club . He took charge of Sunderland in May 1987, and took the club to the Third Division title in 198788, before getting the club promoted from the Second Division in 198990. Dismissed by Sunderland in December 1991, he took charge at Bristol City three months later. He steered the club away from relegation in 199293, but was dismissed in January 1993 after falling out with the club's directors. He was appointed manager of Oxford United in September 1993 and, although unable to avoid relegation in 199394, led the club to promotion from the Second Division in 199596. He switched clubs to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, remaining in charge for two and a half seasons before being dismissed in July 1999. He returned to manage Oxford in February 2000, and steered the club away from relegation in 19992000 before resigning in October 2000. In October 2001 he was appointed manager of Wrexham, but was unable to steer the club away from relegation in 200102. He won promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt in 200203, but Wrexham entered administration in December 2004 and the resulting points deduction saw them relegated once more. Despite the financial problems he managed the club to the Football League Trophy title in 2005, in addition to two successive FAW Premier Cup wins in 2002 and 2003. He was dismissed in January 2007, months after the club exited administration. He married in October 1967 and has three children. Denis Smith was born in Meir, Stoke on Trent, the second youngest of seven siblings. At just three years old he formed his own gang, stating in his autobiography that if we wanted to play in the sandpit we played in the sandpit , and continued to lead his gang through junior and senior years at Sandon Road Junior School. Despite being involved with gangs since his early childhood he grew out of the culture by the age of ten, and as a teenager formed friendships outside of his local council estate. He turned down the chance to sit the eleven plus exam as local grammar school Longton High was a rugby playing school, and so instead attended Queensbury Road School, with whom he won the Stoke Schools Trophy he also played for the Stoke on Trent Schoolboys who were coached by former England international Dennis Wilshaw . At the age of 15 he became Staffordshire County boxing champion. He was only 5 ft 2 in 1.57 m at the age of 14, but a late growth spurt took him to just under six feet, and was therefore tall enough to play centre back as a professional footballer. He was offered an apprenticeship by Portsmouth, but turned it down as he wanted to sign for his local club Stoke City, who initially were not willing to take him on as an apprentice. They only allowed him to train with the 'A' team twice a week as an amateur whilst he initially worked as a plumber's mate, and later as a factory worker at Stone Lotus. Smith signed for Stoke City in September 1966 after telling manager Tony Waddington that he was going to sign a contract at another club though Waddington was not keen on Smith's hard tackling style, he did not want to lose the young player. At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United's FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going as far as to punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period Waddington banned Smith from playing against first team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968, and was given the task of man marking Bobby Gould. He gave away a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance he gave away two penalties in a 31 defeat away to Ipswich Town, and had to wait five months for another first team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line up in a 51 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat trick. Despite the poor start to his senior career, he managed to finish the 196869 season with 14 First Division appearances to his name, and was occasionally used as an emergency striker. Smith established himself in the Stoke defence in 196970, forming a centre back partnership with Alan Bloor in between full backs Jackie Marsh and Mike Pejic. Smith was the aggressive and highly physical defender, complimented by Bloor who tended to stay further back and use his intelligence to read the game and clean up any mistakes Smith made. Smith claimed his first goal for the club on 17 September 1969, in a 31 win over West Bromwich Albion West Brom at the Hawthorns. Stoke reached the semi final of the FA Cup in 197071, and Smith played in the fourth round victory over Huddersfield Town despite suffering from a fractured ankle. He scored the only goal of the match in the fifth round replay away to Ipswich. He also scored a freak goal from a deflected Peter Storey clearance in the semi final against Arsenal on 27 March 1971, but Stoke lost the replay four days later. Stoke reached the FA Cup semi final for a second successive season in 197172, again being knocked out by Arsenal in a replay. He had scored in the quarter final victory over Manchester United and pressured Arsenal's Peter Simpson into scoring an own goal in the original semi final match. However, John Radford was the hero of the tie as he played as an emergency goalkeeper in the first match following an injury to Bob Wilson, and then scored the winning goal in the replay. Stoke found greater success in the League Cup, beating Southport, Oxford United after a replay , Manchester United after two replays , Bristol Rovers and West Ham United after three replays to reach the 1972 League Cup Final against Chelsea. He scored two goals during the run, but was knocked out whilst scoring against Bristol Rovers in the quarter final, and missed some weeks with concussion. He returned to play in the final, man marking Peter Osgood in a match which Stoke won 21 to win their first major trophy. Despite the cup success and arrival of new signing Geoff Hurst, Stoke laboured to a 15th place finish in 197273. Smith blamed the car crash and subsequent injury to Gordon Banks in October 1972 as the cause for the club's mid season slump, which compounded an already poor start to the season. Any concerns over relegation disappeared though with six victories in the final eight league matches. After a poor start to 197374, Waddington signed Alan Hudson in January 1974 to help revive the club's fortunes. The defence also improved, as Smith helped to ensure only two goals were conceded in the last nine matches of the season as Stoke finished fifth. On 23 February 1974, Smith scored the winning goal against Leeds to end their opponent's 29 match unbeaten run. Leeds went on to have a 250,000 bid for Smith turned down by Stoke in the summer. Stoke made a push for the title in 197475. They also competed in the UEFA Cup against Dutch team Ajax, and Smith scored in a 11 draw at the Victoria Ground, though Stoke would lose the tie on away goals. Smith scored the only goal of the match against Leicester City on 30 November 1974 to take Stoke top of the table. However, Smith broke his leg for the fifth time in his career making a red card challenge on Mick Lambert in a 21 defeat to Ipswich on 18 March 1975 he was the fourth Stoke player to break a leg that season. Stoke ended the season again in fifth place, picking up just two points from their final three matches to finish four points behind champions Derby County. He underwent an operation to remove cartilage in his knee in November 1975, and his recovery was not entirely successful. He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at half pace . His long term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 197677. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 197879 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were boring , as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him. A pre season injury kept him out of the entire 198081 season, during which time he coached the reserves. In this time he converted Steve Bould from a striker into a centre back. Smith returned from injury in 198182, and featured regularly early in the season, and by the time another injury forced him out of the team, Stoke were in 18th place. He joined York City, who were struggling in the Fourth Division, on a one month loan in March 1982. He debuted in a 31 home defeat to Hull City on 16 March 1982, and scored once for York, in a 42 loss away to Wigan Athletic on 2 April. Smith made seven appearances while on loan at York, and exerted his influence on the team by organising the defence he commented that They had been crying out for an older head like me . He was recalled by Stoke manager Richie Barker as the defence struggled in his absence, and Smith re established himself in the team as they avoided relegation. He was handed a free transfer to York in May 1982. He said that if he had been offered a coaching role at Stoke he would have stayed, but that Barker wanted him gone as he saw him as a threat to his position. In total, Smith made 493 appearances for Stoke, a club record for a centre back. During Smith's 14 seasons with Stoke, he became known for his fearless mentality which led to him sustaining a large number of injuries. These included five broken legs, breaking his nose four times, a cracked ankle, broken collar bone, chipped spine, breaking most of his fingers and toes and needing more than 200 stitches. The sequence saw him named in the Guinness Book of Records as the most injured man in football. Early into his career Smith soon developed a reputation as a hard player , who would launch himself at opponents determined to either block a shot and win the ball, which is how he picked up most of his injuries. He was known as Stoke's hitman , and relished going toe to toe with the biggest and most feared opposition players. He would generally man mark the opposition's playmaker or major goalscoring threat. He was a highly effective tackler, able to either flatten opposition players or to quickly take the ball off their toes. After the tackle from behind was outlawed he adapted to the rule change by making hard challenges from the side. Manager Tony Waddington said that His qualities were his tackling strength and his courage. On the ball he just did what he could do, but he also had a tremendous ability to read the game. He moved into management with York as player manager ahead of 198283, accepting the position on 12 May 1982. He described the set up at Bootham Crescent on his arrival as a shambles , as training consisted entirely of running and was devoid of any actual coaching. He signed veteran players Roger Jones goalkeeper , Alan Hay defender and Ricky Sbragia defender , as well as young Stoke defender Chris Evans, which including Smith himself meant a complete change in the club's back line. He brought in striker Viv Busby as a player coach. He then made 6 ft 1 in 1.85 m 26 year old striker Keith Walwyn his priority, and encouraged Walwyn to use his natural physical presence to become a greater threat in front of goal and unlock his potential. Smith retired from playing after steering York to a seventh place in 198283, in which he made 36 appearances and scored 4 goals. He signed Sheffield United's John MacPhail on a free transfer as a replacement for himself. In his second season as York manager, 198384, he signed another former teammate, energetic midfielder Sean Haslegrave. Smith was named as the division's Manager of the Month for March 1984 after York won five and drew one of their six league matches. He guided York to the Fourth Division title and promotion into the Third Division, with Walwyn scoring 25 goals and earning a place in the PFA Team of the Year alongside strike partner John Byrne, who scored 27 goals. York finished with 101 points, 16 points ahead of runners up Doncaster Rovers. Early in 198485 York were beaten by Queens Park Rangers QPR in the League Cup, but Byrne impressed QPR manager Alan Mullery enough to earn a 100,000 move to Loftus Road. Smith spent half of this sum a club record on Aldershot forward Dale Banton, who went on to score 49 goals in 138 appearances for the club. He also released winger Brian Pollard, but found that the man he signed in his place, Gary Nicholson, was not able to replicate Pollard's form. York started the season well and another of his signings, Keith Houchen 15,000 , scored a hat trick in a 71 win over Gillingham in November 1984. On 26 January 1975, he guided York to victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round. In the next round York came from behind to draw 11 at home with Liverpool, before losing 70 away at Anfield. York again drew Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round in 198586, and took the lead through Gary Ford only to concede a stoppage time equaliser. Tony Canham scored at Anfield and York had a second goal disallowed before York succumbed to a 31 defeat in extra time. York lost only three home league matches all season, but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986 he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for 15,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed when he first came to the club were coming to the end of their careers. The 198687 season was disappointing for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th place. They did though manage to beat Chelsea 10 in the League Cup, but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 30. Smith ended up falling out with the club's directors, who invested money in the club's facilities rather than on players, and released goalkeeper Andy Leaning against his wishes. In May 1987, Smith was appointed manager at Sunderland, who had just been relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than 20,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay 10,000. Smith agreed to a 40,000 a year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra 10,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals including 10 penalties in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left back Reuben Agboola, centre back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for 275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for 80,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates the pair scored 42 goals between them in 198788. A 70 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points. Injuries to Kay and Lemon hindered Sunderland at the start of 198889, and they took until 1 October 1988 to register their first win back in the Second Division. He signed burly striker Billy Whitehurst to act as a battering ram , who proved to be an effective player despite being a heavy binge drinker. He spent a club record 500,000 on goalkeeper Tony Norman, though Hesford and Whitehurst were traded as part exchange on the fee. Sunderland improved and ended the season in 11th place. He signed experienced forward Paul Bracewell for 198990, who partnered an increasingly effective Gabbiadini, and spent 130,000 on Portsmouth left back Paul Hardyman. He introduced the exceptionally talented teenage winger Kieron Brady to the first team, but was unable to discipline the precocious teenager, and Brady never realised his full potential. Sunderland reached the play offs, and faced rivals Newcastle United in the semi final, securing passage into the final with a 20 victory at St James' Park. They lost 10 to Swindon Town in the play off final at Wembley Stadium. However, Swindon were found guilty of financial irregularities and remained in the Second Division, whilst Sunderland took their place in the First Division. Having been promoted weeks after the end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 199091. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent 350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent 225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 32 and were relegated back into the Second Division. In the summer of 1991, Stoke chairman Peter Coates offered Smith the vacant management position at the club, but Smith decided that potentially being dismissed by his hometown club would be too intense an experience emotionally, and chose to stay loyal to Sunderland. This was despite finances being tight at Sunderland as the club saved the money to build the Stadium of Light. However, after just 4 wins in the opening 14 matches of 199192, Smith decided to sell star striker Gabbiadini to Crystal Palace for 1.8 million in order to raise funds to improve the squad. He then spent 350,000 on Celtic left back Anton Rogan and brought in strikers Don Goodman 900,000 from West Bromwich Albion and John Byrne 225,000 from Brighton Hove Albion . Smith was dismissed on 30 December 1991, with Sunderland lying 17th in the Second Division. His former assistant Malcolm Crosby took Sunderland to the 1992 FA Cup Final, in which they were beaten by Liverpool. Smith was only out of work for nine weeks before being appointed manager of Bristol City on 9 March 1992. He succeeded Jimmy Lumsden, who left the club second from bottom in the Second Division. Smith felt the team lacked pace, so signed 20 year old striker Andy Cole on loan from Arsenal. Dariusz Dziekanowski scored both goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers Wolves in Smith's second match in charge to provide City with their first win in three months. They then won 31 against Smith's former club Sunderland, with Cole scoring the first of his 8 goals in 12 appearances during his loan spell. Smith successfully steered the club out of the relegation zone at the end of 199293 with a run of eight matches unbeaten, and paid a club record 500,000 to secure Cole's services on a permanent basis. He further paid 250,000 for Everton midfielder Raymond Atteveld and signed West Ham United striker Leroy Rosenior. Smith rebuilt the defence for 199394, signing right back Brian Mitchell and centre back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed start to the season. City won four straight home matches but also lost 51 to West Ham, 50 at Newcastle, and most significantly 40 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He found it difficult to control the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor. Smith made a return to management with Oxford on 10 September 1993, and the following day led them to a 42 victory over his former club Bristol City. A victory over another former club, Stoke, took Oxford off the bottom of the Second Division, but a sequence of just 2 wins in 17 matches left them in great danger of relegation. He signed goalkeeper Phil Whitehead on loan from Barnsley, signed striker John Byrne 50,000 from Millwall for the third time in his career, and then made what he later said was the best signing of his career by bringing in defender Matt Elliott from Scunthorpe United for 170,000. Oxford were boosted by these arrivals and briefly exited the relegation zone, also claiming an FA Cup giant killing over Leeds at Elland Road after Jim Magilton scored the winning goal in extra time. However, after the match Magilton moved to Southampton for a 600,000 fee. Oxford had struggled in the league during their FA Cup run and were 15 points short of safety with 16 matches to play, but were aided by 60,000 signing Paul Moody, who, despite arriving in February 1994, managed to finish as the club's top scorer with 12 goals in 15 appearances. His arrival kick started the club's fightback, and Oxford closed the 15 points gap in just 9 matches. However, a difficult run in left Oxford needing to beat Notts County on the last day of the season and hope results elsewhere went their way, and though they beat County their relegation rivals also claimed victories and Oxford were relegated. The sale of star midfielder Joey Beauchamp to West Ham for a club record 1 million allowed Smith money to spend in the transfer market, and he spent 100,000 each on Norwich City midfielder David Smith and Sunderland striker David Rush. Oxford formed a strong promotion push in 199495, but were knocked out of the FA Cup in the first round by non League Marlow. In February 1995, he spent 60,000 on Hartlepool United's Phil Gilchrist, who would form a highly effective centre back partnership with Elliott. Oxford finished the season in seventh place, six points outside the play offs. In November 1995, Smith re signed Beauchamp for 300,000, who continued his excellent form after returning to his native Oxfordshire. The next month he brought in striker Martin Aldridge on a free transfer. The club were 14th in January 1996, but lost only once in their last 17 matches of 199596 in a tremendous second half of the season that saw them climb 12 places to win promotion as runners up. At the end of the season, Smith became a director of the club. In order to strengthen for 199697, Smith signed striker Nigel Jemson and spent 100,000 on Leyton Orient defender Darren Purse. In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham Forest for 450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday out of the League Cup en route to a fourth round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial problems at the club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached 13 million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for 1.7 million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club's financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend 170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 199798 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club's mid table position at the end of the season. Smith was appointed manager of West Brom on a three year contract on 24 December 1997, with Oxford receiving around 100,000 in compensation. He had a mixed start to his time at the Hawthorns as Albion fell from promotion contenders to a tenth place finish in 199798, but recorded victories over local rivals Wolves and Stoke. In preparation for 199899, he signed athletic Derby centre back Matt Carbon for 800,000, Blackpool striker James Quinn for 500,000, and Manchester City defender Jason van Blerk for 50,000. He also brought in winger Mark Angel, midfielders Mario Bortolazzi and Enzo Maresca, and striker Fabian de Freitas. However, the player who had the greatest impact for West Brom was young striker Lee Hughes, who had been signed before Smith's arrival but only made his first start under Smith. Aside from Maresca, many of Smith's signings had little impact, and supporters criticised him for allowing popular goalkeeper Alan Miller and strikers Andy Hunt and Bob Taylor to leave the club. West Brom started the season well with Hughes in tremendous form, but a slump in form in March 1999 left them ending up in 12th place. Smith was dismissed on 27 July 1999, just a week before the start of 19992000. On 3 February 2000, Smith was appointed manager of Oxford for the second time in his career, with the club 21st in the Second Division. He re signed striker Nigel Jemson from Ayr United, and kept Oxford in the division as they ended 19992000 in 20th place, one place and one point above the relegation zone. He signed a one year contract extension in the summer of 2000, but fell out with chairman Firoz Kassam. He later admitted that the signings he made on a limited budget, which included Ian McGuckin, Andy Scott and Rob Quinn, were not good enough. Smith resigned on 2 October 2000 after a terrible start to 200001, a season which ended in Oxford being relegated in last place. He continued to work as a scout for the club under Dave Kemp and then Mark Wright. Smith returned to management on 8 October 2001 with Wrexham on a two year contract, replacing Brian Flynn who had resigned after 12 years in charge, with the club 23rd in the Second Division. He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided to cut back on the club's youth coaching spending, and as a result Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Rvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 50 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground. He signed wing back Paul Edwards and held on to most of his key players for the 200203 season. Wrexham had a good start to the season and Smith won the Manager of the Month award for September 2002 after a sequence of four wins and two draws. A slump followed but Wrexham recovered from a poor October 2002 after coming from behind to beat Bournemouth on 9 November, as strikers Andy Morrell and Lee Trundle formed a good partnership, with Jones an impact substitute. Wrexham dropped out of the play off places following a sequence of draws in March 2003, but new signing Scott Green scored both goals in a 20 win over Hartlepool United on 18 March, the first of a sequence of eight victories that took Wrexham into the third automatic promotion place with four matches to go. They held on to the position to secure promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt. Wrexham also beat Newport County 61 in the final of the FAW Premier Cup to secure an important 100,000 in prize money. Smith was named as the Manager of the Month for April and 2003, before winning the League Managers Association's Third Division Manager of the Season award. Smith lost Morrell and Trundle on free transfers, and replaced them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 200304, although they remained in the play off places in December 2003. However, a hairline fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 41 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton. Writing in his autobiography, Smith described 200405 the most harrowing, distressing footballing time of my life as the club entered administration with debts of 2.6 million. Wrexham became the first club to be deducted 10 points for entering administration and were subsequently relegated from League One, eight points short of safety despite new signing Juan Ugarte scoring 23 goals. Despite the financial trouble Wrexham managed to win the Football League Trophy, knocking out Notts County, Stockport County, Chester City, Hereford United and Oldham Athletic en route to the final against Southend United at the Millennium Stadium. The final was settled in extra time, with Ugarte and Darren Ferguson securing a 20 victory. The club earned 250,000 in prize money and the first national trophy in Wrexham's history. Smith turned down the managerial role at Blackpool to remain in place at Wrexham for 200506. He signed goalkeeper Michael Ingham, defenders David Bayliss and Lee Roche, and strikers Lee McEvilly and Jonathan Walters, whilst blooding brothers Marc and Mike Williams. However, Wrexham struggled in the league, despite on loan striker Matt Derbyshire scoring 10 goals in 16 appearances. They finished the season 13th in League Two, having won only one of their last nine matches. The last match of the season was a 11 draw with former club Oxford, which hastened Oxford's relegation out of the Football League. Wrexham exited 18 months of administration at the start of 200607, and started the season with an eight match unbeaten run, including a 41 win over Championship club Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. However, a 50 defeat at Accrington Stanley triggered a run of bad results that Smith was unable to turn around. With Wrexham hovering above the relegation zone in 18th place, Smith was dismissed on 11 January 2007. He is one of only 24 people to have managed over 1,000 professional matches in English football. He married childhood sweetheart Kate in October 1967. Their first child Paul was born in April 1969, and was named after teammate Paul Shardlow, who had died six months earlier. They had two further children Becky, and Tom born 1978 . Smith released his autobiography, Just One Of Seven, in November 2008. He writes a weekly column for The Sentinel and is occasionally a commentator on Stoke matches for BBC Radio Stoke. In July 2011, he re joined Stoke on a part time basis as a mentor for young Academy players needing guidance off the pitch.

"Eleanor Sophia Smith 15 June 1858 30 June 1942 was an American composer and music educator. She was one of the founders of Chicago's Hull House Music School, and headed its music department from 1893 to 1936. Born into a musical family, Smith taught herself to play the piano and later became a classically trained musician. Earning a teaching degree, she began publishing music compositions for children using the philosophy of Friedrich Frobel, advocating for less memorization and drilling and more attention to intuitive appreciation of music. Studying composition and voice in Germany, she also toured the country observing choirs and their teaching techniques. Returning to the United States in 1890, Smith began working at the settlement house, Hull House, as a music instructor. Within three years she had co founded the Hull House Music School, a school which followed her progressive teaching ideas, cross training students in vocal music as well as instruments. Simultaneously, she worked in several institutions in the Chicago area which trained music educators. Smith published numerous compilations of songs, including two six volume textbook series, which were widely used throughout the United States. Most of her writings were focused on children's voices and contained short songs written with attention paid to the limited range and short attention span of children. Many of her compositions were still being used in music education programs in the latter part of the 20th century. Born in Atlanta, Illinois in 1858, Eleanor was the daughter of Willard Newton and Matilda Jaspersen Smith. She came from a musical family, as her father was a noted bass in the First Presbyterian Church Choir in Chicago between 1860 and 1871. In an interview she gave in 1908, Smith claimed that both sides of her family were musical, noting that a paternal great grandfather composed hymns and that her maternal line was a musical mix of Danish, French, German and Jewish ancestry. Smith taught herself to play the piano and did not begin any formal training for voice or composition until she was eighteen years old. She had very poor vision, which limited her ability to use her eyes for long periods of time. She studied at the Hershey School of Musical Art, and published her first cantata, The Golden Asp , while still a student there. She later graduated from Cook County Normal School, but continued to study music privately as a pupil of Frances A. Root voice and Frederick Grant Gleason composition . After completing her schooling, Smith commenced teaching at the Cook County Normal School for a few years, before moving to Germany to continue her studies. She went to Berlin in 1887, where she studied with Moritz Moszkowski composition , Julius Hey voice and Ludwig Bussler for three years. While she was in Germany, she traveled through the country observing choirs where she could obtain permission to do so. In some instances, she was not allowed to observe or be seen, as her presence was deemed improper in groups made up of only male performers or students. While in Berlin, she and friends discussed the benefits of teaching where students were cross trained in both piano and voice, which would be advantageous to both. Such study would prevent pianists from losing the melodic focus and being overly technical and singers would gain technique rather than focusing solely on performance. As early as 1885, she was publishing songs and collaborating with poets for lyrics, including such works as Cradle Song , A Million Little Diamonds , Only Thine Own Mine Art , The Quest and She Kisses with her Eyes . Smith gained a reputation as a songwriter by the early 1890s and many of her works were translated into German during this period. She also wrote hymns, though they may have remained in manuscript. Smith began publishing for children in 1887, with her first volume of children's music entitled Songs for Little Children, Part 1. She was a proponent and follower of the teaching philosophy of Friedrich Frobel. Smith incorporated Frobel's ideas that childhood is a universal experience in which children learn by imitation, using their natural abilities. Her compositions also recognized that children learn by movement and play, but have limited attention spans. Thus, the compositions she created were usually short melodies, with limited vocal ranges, and were easy to sing. The songs were in major keys, typically C, F, and G and extended only from C1 to F2. Most melodies were made in stepped triads and provided pauses for activity. For example, in her song The Wind Mill there is an eight measure rest for the children to make the motions of the turning blades. In 1894, after Smith returned from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for Little Children, Part 2. As in her previous work, most of the songs were in major keys with the most common being A flat major and E flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, though some of the pieces were adaptations of German folk songs. Smith's first textbook series, The Modem Music Series, in six volumes was published in 1898 by Scott, Foresman and Company, with rights later purchased by the Silver Burdette Company. It was a collaboration with Robert Foresman, another music educator who believed that children should be allowed to learn intuitively. It set forth a new movement in music instruction which rejected the traditional sight singing memorization method of training and instead relied on the song method . In this type of instruction, students learned the skills for reading music from a combination of interval recognition, ear training and observation of songs. The books were successful, using many of Smith's own songs and became the basis for similar textbooks based on her ideas and works, such as the publication in 1909 by Charles H. Congdon called the Congdon Music Readers series, which incorporated 21 songs by Smith. Smith published a second textbook series, The Eleanor Smith Music Series, in 1908, which also contained six volumes and was widely distributed in US public schools. In 1910, Smith published Songs of a Little Childs Day, which included 66 songs of original compositions by Smith and text by Emilie Poulsson. The songs focused on a limited range to make it easy for high pitched children's voices to sing the works and most of the songs contained sixteen bars or less. Accompaniment lines for the piano, duplicated the vocal lines, but had artistic flourishes, such as a section in the piece The Busy Wind , which used a repetitive pattern of sixteenth notes to imitate the sound of blowing wind. In honor of the 25th anniversary of Hull House, in 1915, five of Smith's compositions were published as The Hull House Songs. The themes represented social issues which were prevalent at the time including The Land of the Noonday Night about mining safety, the Suffrage Song about women's voting, and The Shadow Child about child labor with words penned by poet, Harriet Monroe. As early as 1901, she had written compositions for poems with social themes, such as the work she created for Morris Rosenfeld's poem Sweat Shop . Other works Smith authored include Song Pictures Twelve Songs for Twelve Boys The Golden Asp cantata Wedding Music No. 1 and No. 2 Trolls' Holiday operetta and Twelve Songs . Her works continued to be popular into the 1980s, attesting to the quality of their composition. Smith arrived at Hull House in the autumn of 1890 and shortly after her first visit began to give voice and piano lessons to both children and adults. Initially free concerts were given on Sunday, both as a means to uplift the community and to highlight the talents of the settlement house teachers and musicians. Between November 1891 and April 1892, there were 22 Sunday concerts held at Hull House before the music school was officially founded. Smith was one of the founders of Hull House Music School the following year, which became the first settlement music school in the United States. She invited one of her friends from Germany, Amalie Hannig, who had been teaching piano at the Klindworth Conservatory to help her with the school. Hannig taught both piano and voice at the school until 1898. Mary Rozet Smith, one of the benefactors of Hull House provided the funding to establish the school. In the late 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a disagreement over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, felt that the purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached at the turn of the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain. Smith's teaching style differed from conventional music instruction at the time in that she required instrumental students to study voice. Piano, organ and violin instruction was offered by 1907. Organ was under the instruction of Gertrude Madeira Smith, Eleanor's sister, and violin was taught by Charles Moerenhout of the Chicago Orchestra. Five assistants also helped the teachers. Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on memorization of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments. She also incorporated songs from the students' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures with their new lives and made effort to involve the parents in the development of the curricula. As a progressive reformer, Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence. She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest instruction and to recover songs from their cultural backgrounds. As well as teaching music at Hull House, Smith served as the choral director. She also composed songs and arranged music specifically for her students to perform. She initiated an annual Christmas concert which also included a dramatic presentation and was eagerly anticipated by the neighborhood for its holiday pageantry. Under her direction of the music school, the Hull House Boy's Band developed, which included immigrant boys from the neighborhood who would later become noted jazz performers. Jazz pianist Art Hodes recalled that one of the first jam sessions he ever had occurred when a young clarinetist named Benny Goodman joined the Boy's Band. James Petrillo, who would later become the leader of the musician's union, the American Federation of Musicians, was also a member of the group. In addition to her work at Hull House, Smith was involved in public education. Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago as the head of the Department of Music, School of Education from 1901 to 1910. She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised curriculum for the music education program. Smith also instructed courses at the Chicago Kindergarten College and at the Froebel Kindergarten College, both training colleges for teachers of very young children. Smith favored women's suffrage, and was an Episcopalian by religion. She was a member of the Chicago Woman's Club, Chickaming Country Club, North Side Branch Equal Suffrage League, and the Audubon Society. In 1897, she moved into the settlement house and lived there until 1924. At that time, she lived in the home of Mary Rozet Smith, where she remained until around 1934. Smith returned to Hull House as a resident until she retired in 1936, and was succeeded by her sister, Gertrude. For health reasons, at that time, Smith moved to Midland, Michigan, where she resided with a niece until her death on June 30, 1942 in Midland. She was buried in Annapolis, Maryland. Posthumously, Smith's papers were donated to the University of Illinois at Chicago to preserve what Jane Addams described as one of the most finely creative minds which fulfilled the highest mission of music .

"Erasmus Smith 1611 1691 was an English merchant and a landowner with possessions in England and Ireland. Having acquired significant wealth through trade and land transactions, he became a philanthropist in the sphere of education, treading a path between idealism and self interest during a period of political and religious turbulence. His true motivations remain unclear. Smith's family owned manors in Leicestershire and held Protestant beliefs. He became a merchant, supplying provisions to the armies of the Puritan Oliver Cromwell during Cromwell's suppression of rebellion in Ireland and an alderman of the City of London. His financial and landowning status was greatly enhanced by benefiting from his father's subscription to the Adventurers' Act from which he gained extensive landholdings in Ireland as a reward, and from his own speculative practice of buying additional subscriptions from other investors. During the period of Cromwell's rule and the subsequent Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property was used for the purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law. Erasmus Smith was born in 1611 and baptised on 8 April of that year at Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire. He was the second son of Roger Smith and his second wife, Anna nee Goodman . The family had changed their name to Smith from Heriz or Harris when they inherited the manor of Edmondthorpe during the reign of Henry VII, and it was Erasmus's paternal grandfather, also called Erasmus, who had bought the manor of Husbands Bosworth in 1565. Henry Silver tongued Smith, the Puritan preacher, was an uncle of Erasmus, and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Goodman, was a wealthy London merchant. The contacts of Thomas Goodman enabled Erasmus to serve a seven year apprenticeship in London with a poultry merchant, John Saunders, and he was made a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 10 February 1635. By 1631 Roger Smith had become an alderman of the City of London and in 1635 he was knighted Erasmus followed in his father's footsteps, being elected an alderman in 1657, but preferred to pay a fine of 420 in order to be released from the duties of office. In these early years he was also unwilling to have much involvement in the business of the Grocers' Company, although this changed later in life the cause of his initial reluctance may have been his preference to concentrate on acquiring his wealth. According to the records of the Aldermen of the City of London, Erasmus was Member of Parliament for Ardee in County Louth between 1665 and 1666. In July 1642 Roger Smith subscribed 225 under the terms of the Adventurers' Act of 1641, whereby money loaned to the government of Charles I for the purpose of suppressing the Irish rebellion was secured by lands to be confiscated in that country. The lands had been confiscated in law but it would require the overthrow of the rebels in order to realise those property assets. The subsequent Doubling Ordinance of 1643 allowed those who had subscribed to receive twice the amount of land if they added a further 25 per cent of their initial financial aid Roger Smith accepted those terms, contributing a further 75 in July 1643 and then two more payments of 75 in August and in October of that year. Erasmus Smith had become a Turkey merchant . He was a Protestant and, like his father, by 1650 he was supplying foodstuffs to Oliver Cromwell's armies in the civil wars of that time. This applied in particular to military activities in Ireland, where the rebellion of 1641 was believed by him and others to have resulted in part from a failure of education in that country. W. J. R. Wallace, in his history of Smith and the eponymous Trust, notes that the first record of Erasmus being in Ireland is from 1648 and that .mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden margin 1em 0 padding 0 40px .mw parser output .templatequote .templatequotecite line height 1.5em text align left padding left 1.6em margin top 0 Erasmus was clearly a businessman first and foremost any attempt to put him into a political stereotype as a Roundhead and then accuse him of political double dealing seems inaccurate. By the time that the rebellion was suppressed in 1653, and just prior to the first assignments of land under the terms of the Settlement of Ireland Act, 1652, Roger had registered the transfer of his investment to Erasmus. Erasmus had speculated by buying out the interests of other subscribers, who had tired of the delay in seeing a reward from their investment and he was also entitled to further land grants in payment for his supplies to the army. What began as a grant of 666 acres 270 ha eventually became by the 1680s, after various wranglings and adjustments over 46,000 acres 19,000 ha situated in nine counties, and Erasmus had an estimated worth of 120,000. Some of these lands, notably those in Connaught, may have been obtained fraudulently by Erasmus, who together with his nephew Edward Smith, sat on the committee based at Grocers' Hall whose purpose was the allocation of lots for the distribution of land between the debenture holders. Edward Smith was subsequently appointed to a Court of Claims in Dublin, where he may also have favoured his uncle Erasmus in his applications for land. Although Smith visited Dublin while overseeing his land purchases, he had no desire actually to live in Ireland. In 1655 the year that his father died he proposed that some of the profits from his Irish lands should be used to support five Protestant schools for boys. A Trust was established for this purpose in 1657, in relation to which Smith and the Grocers' Company had various powers of oversight. There were 18 trustees, the principal of whom was Henry Jones, who was soon to become Protestant Bishop of Meath. There have been various suggestions since at least the 19th century that creating the trust may not have been an altruistic act but rather one intended to curry favour and counter any possible legal challenges to holdings over which he had a tenuous claim, such as those obtained in Connaught. Writing in 1824, Hely Dutton said in his Statistical Survey of County Galway that Well knowing that his titles and tenures were very precarious, and liable at a future period to be litigated, he very cunningly made a grant of lands for the founding and endowment of Protestant schools, and other charitable purposes, for which he later, in 1669 obtained a Charter ... appointing the bench of bishops, the lord chancellor, the judges, the great law officers, all for the time being, governors and trustees well knowing that if any flaw should ever appear in the patents, titles or tenures, under which he got the estates, the law officers would always protect and make the title good to his heirs. The Trust initially encompassed 3,381 acres 1,368 ha of his land. In keeping with his religious views, the schools were to teach their pupils fear of God and good literature and to speak the English tongue , and both prayers and catechism in the style of the Presbyterian Assembly of Divines were compulsory. Those pupils who showed particular promise were to have the opportunity of taking up scholarships at Trinity College, Dublin. His plans for the Trust were, however, overtaken by events. Cromwell died in 1658 and Smith's arrangements were not entirely acceptable to the new regime. The Restoration period, which began around 1660 and saw Charles II become king, was not sympathetic to the Puritan beliefs of the Cromwellian Interregnum. Nonetheless, Smith's venture was able to survive the political upheaval and change in moral tone, albeit in modified form. That it did so was largely due to his wealth and connections, but also because the educational purpose for which his lands were being used was clearly beneficial and because he engaged in many lawsuits in order to protect both his own interests and those of family and friends. Referred to by his enemies as pious Erasmus with the golden purse , Smith came to an arrangement in 1667 which reduced the number of schools to three and required that he give 100 annually to one of Charles's favourite institutes, Christ's Hospital. The terms stipulated that although the schools were to be for the free education of children of Smith's tenants, they should each provide education on similar terms to a further 20 children from poor families, and that additional children could be schooled at a charge not to exceed two shillings. Wallace argues that Smith adapted to the different versions of Protestantism which were favoured by successive governments during the Commonwealth and the Restoration. Since these did not involve denial of any of the fundamentals of his faith, the changes were probably not too painful. He retained his sympathy for the Puritan divines of his youth to the end of his life, as witnessed by some of the bequests in his will. A Royal Charter was granted to the Trust in 1669. This stipulated its name to be The Governors of the Schools Founded by Erasmus Smith, Esq. and provided for a seal bearing the words We are faithful to our Trust . By 1675, the new board of 32 trustees had around 600 per annum available to them from the landholdings by the first quarter of the 18th century this had risen to 1100. Free schools were established in Templemore, Galway and Drogheda. Funding was also given to another school, in Dublin the recently founded King's Hospital School benefited from the trust's interest by being provided with twenty scholarships at Trinity College and also apprenticeships. The trust also funded a lectureship in Hebrew at the College, and arrangements were in place to that any surplus funds generated were used for purposes such as clothing the poor children in the grammar schools and arranging apprenticeships. During his lifetime, the Irish schools were not as successful as Smith had anticipated. He and others attributed this to the resentment shown by Catholics, and there was also resentment from those charged with sending Irish rent money to England's Christ's Hospital. The arrangement by which an annual grant was given to Christ's Hospital corresponded with Smith's own interests in that institution. The Hospital had for many years enjoyed close links with various Livery Companies and Smith had become a Governor there in 1658. The aftermath of the Great Fire of London in 1666, as a consequence of which the Hospital was destroyed, demonstrated his interest. He wrote that Providence sometime after the fire directed me to view the Hospital which with grief I beheld in its ashes. The consideration of the many children that had their habitation there but then scattered abroad, made me resolve to encourage others with myself to raise the foundation. Smith was a benefactor during the period of reconstruction. He became frustrated that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid 1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him under the terms of the Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter. Various parties then engaged in legal actions and in petitions to both Charles II and his successor from 1685, James II. With the added complication of James II being overthrown by William of Orange, the dispute remained unresolved at the time of Smith's death. Smith had married Mary Hare, the 20 year old daughter of Hugh Hare, the 1st Baron Coleraine, in 1670 when he was 59. The couple had nine children, five of whom were baptised in Clerkenwell, where he had lived at St John's Court for many years. In 1683 he bought the manor of Hamerton, Huntingdonshire, in the parish church of which he was buried, next to his wife, upon his death some time between 25 August and 9 October 1691. He had also bought Weald Hall in 1685. Smith's six sons and three daughters mostly died young. One, Hugh Smith, inherited Weald and Hamerton from his older siblings in 1732 and appointed his two daughters as co heirs. One of those daughters, Lucy, married into the Stanley family. Her husband changed his surname to become James Smith Stanley, Lord Strange, and the couple were the parents of Edward Smith Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby. As of 2016 , the Erasmus Smith Trust continues to operate. Four professorships at Trinity College are named after him Notes Citations Bibliography",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus%20Smith
"Geoffrey Geoff Smith 14 March 1928 19 October 2013 was an English professional footballer who played 253 league games for Bradford City as a goalkeeper, including 200 consecutive appearances. When he retired, he held club records for the number of clean sheets in a season and total clean sheets. Smith was born in Cottingley, Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, moved to nearby Keighley with his family before serving in Malaya in the British Army at the end of his teens. His first trial at Bradford City was unsuccessful but after playing amateur football for Lancashire Combination League sides Nelson and Rossendale United, he was signed by Bradford's new manager Ivor Powell in 1952. He was at Bradford City for seven seasons and played in every league game between the final match of the 195354 season and October 1958. He eventually retired in 1959. After his football career, Smith and his wife ran two different off licences for the remainder of their working life. Smith was born in Cottingley on the outskirts of Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 14 March 1928. He had a brother Jack and during their childhood, the Smith family moved to Keighley, where Smith first played football for St Anne's Church. At the age of 18, Smith was called up to the army. He served in an infantry unit in Malaya for two years before he returned to Keighley. Smith resumed his football career back at home with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, who were at the time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years at a time when the club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again. In December 1952, on the advice of Smith's friend Roy Brook, who was in Bradford's second team, new Bradford City manager Ivor Powell invited Smith back to City for another trial and he played for the reserves against Gainsborough Trinity and Notts County. This time, Smith's trial was successful and Bradford City still a Third Division North side signed him on amateur forms. Smith had played only seven games for the reserves in the Midland League and was still unpaid when he was given his first team debut against Scunthorpe United on 17 January 1953 coming into the side for Brendan McManus, whom Smith said was having a rough time . It was not a good start for Smith, with City losing 40, but he followed this with a clean sheet in his second game against Stockport County and kept his place in the side for the remainder of the season, playing 19 games, before he signed part time professional terms in July 1953. He had previously worked part time as a lorry driver, earning 4 10s 4.50 working 48 hours per week as a lorry driver, but the club did not want him driving around the country and offered him 10 per week plus a 4 win bonus. To supplement his playing contract, the club gave Smith a job looking after their Valley Parade ground. During the mid season break, McManus left City to join Frickley Athletic. Instead, Powell signed Jimmy Gooch from Preston North End as his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, was more experienced than Smith and so took over as first choice goalkeeper at the start of the 195354 season playing the first 20 games. Smith was called up to the first team in November for a 11 draw with Hartlepools United. He remained in the side and played all but two games for the rest of the season, coming back into the team for the final league game of the season against Gateshead as City finished fifth. He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games, during which they conceded just one goal. Gooch left City after just one season to join Watford leaving Smith to take over the number one shirt. For the next four seasons, Smith, who became a full time professional, played every single first team game for City which eventually led to him making 200 consecutive league appearances it was a run that coincided with one of 246 league and FA Cup games by full back George Mulholland. However, for three seasons, City could not match the fifth place gained in 195354 and they remained a Third Division North side. In 195758, under Powell's replacement as manager Peter Jackson, City finished in third place but missed out on the title by nine points to Scunthorpe United. During the season, Smith set a new club record of 18 clean sheets, one which was later equalled by Steve Smith and Eric McManus. The following season, Smith's run of consecutive games came to an end against Reading in October 1958, with Jim McCusker coming into the side to replace him for two games. Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and Charlie Bicknell. He played 26 further games in the 195859 season, in which the club finished 11th in the newy formed Third Division. The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31. His last game was a 21 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959. When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league, keeping a club record 70 clean sheets. His record stood until it was broken by Paul Tomlinson in the 1990s. When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a benefit match. Smith met his wife Margaret at a ceilidh at St Anne's Social Club, in Keighley, in 1944, when they were both teenagers. They married after Smith returned from his two years in the army on 26 August 1950 at Holy Trinity Church, in Keighley. Together, they had two daughters. Smith had been a motor mechanic before his football career, and after he retired from playing, he and his wife ran an off licence store in Cross Roads for 25 years and a newsagents in Keighley for another five years. Smith played bowls and golf in his retirement, playing for Skipton Vets in the former sport. Smith died on 19 October 2013.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff%20Smith%20%28footballer%29
"George Toogood Smith 1903 5 June 1955 was the maternal uncle, through marriage, of John Lennon. Smith operated his family's two dairy farms and a retail outlet with his brother, Frank Smith, in the village of Woolton, Liverpool. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations, but after the start of World War II, they were taken over by the British Government for war work. Smith started courting Mimi Stanley in the spring of 1932, but was thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. After delivering milk to the hospital where she worked he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, or nothing at all On 15 September 1939, she finally married him. They bought a semi detached house called Mendips, named after the range of hills, at 251 Menlove Avenue, Liverpool. Lennon lived with Smith and his wife for the majority of his childhood, and Smith taught the young Lennon to read, read him nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles. He also taught him to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ. Smith collapsed and died on a Sunday at his home of a liver haemorrhage, aged 52, and was buried in St Peters Church graveyard, Woolton. George Toogood Smith's parents, Francis and Alice Smith, had eight children in total Mary, Eleanor, Francis, Robert, Alice, George, Alfred and one other who died. Robert was killed in action on 30 August 1918 in World War I. George's paternal grandmother's maiden name was Toogood which was given to George as a middle name. His mother died in 1949. Smith operated his family's two dairy farms and a shop with his brother Frank in the village of Woolton. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith delivered milk by horse and cart in the Woolton area. The raw milk he provided was stored in a large churn and was ladled out into the bottles and receptacles of customers. When other girls were thinking of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures. She once confided that she never wanted to get married, as she hated the idea of being tied to the kitchen sink . She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, to which Smith delivered milk every morning. Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. George Stanley Mimi's father would only allow the couple to sit in the back room of the family home in Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting, so after delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, or nothing at all The youngest sister of the Stanley family, Julia Stanley, had married Alfred Lennon nine months before, on 3 December 1938. On 15 September 1939, Mimi finally married Smith. They bought a semi detached house called Mendips named after the range of hills at 251 Menlove Avenue across the road from the Allerton Park golf course in a middle class area of Liverpool. After World War II started the British Government took over the Smith family's farmland for war work, and they had to find other sources of income. Menlove Avenue suffered extensive damage during the war, and Smith and his wife often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in their garden. Smith was called up for military service, but was discharged three years later, and subsequently worked in an aircraft factory in Speke until the end of the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led his wife to complain that Smith was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money. During 19421943, Mimi's sister Julia lived with Lennon at The Dairy Cottage 120a Allerton Road, Woolton, which was owned by the Smith family. Lennon lived with Smith and his wife for the majority of his childhood when his mother Julia under pressure from the local authorities, Mimi, and the Stanley family was told that she was unable to care for her son. Julia was eventually forced to hand the care of Lennon over to Mimi and George, who had no children of their own. Lennon then lived continuously at Mendips in the smallest bedroom, which was located above the front door. Lennon later talked about Mendips and the area around it I lived in the suburbs in a nice semi detached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around... not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all The Beatles' stories . Smith was very fond of Lennon, and his softer approach to parenting was in stark contrast to his stern wife, who based everything on decorum, honesty and a black and white attitude either you were good enough or you were not. Pete ShottonLennon's school friendlater commented that Mimi had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong . In contrast, Smith used to give the young Lennon squeakers kisses that his wife did not approve of. Smith taught the four year old Lennon to read by reading aloud the headlines of the Liverpool Echo, read him nursery rhymes at night, and later taught Lennon how to solve crossword puzzles. Smith told Lennon that words did not have to be taken at face value, as they had many different meanings, something Lennon would later use in his writing. He also taught Lennon to draw and paint and bought him his first mouth organ. Mimi admitted that she never had the time to go playing ducks in the bath with him Lennon but that Smith would put Lennon to bed nearly every night. Mimi later said John loved his uncle George. I felt quite left out of that. They'd go off together, just leaving me a bar of chocolate and a note saying 'Have a happy day.' Though he worked at night and early in the morning on the farm and his milkround, Smith often took Lennon and his cousins to the cinema or the park. When the cousins played outside Smith allowed them to eat meals with their hands in the garden shed. During the school holidays Lennon and his cousins were allowed to accompany Smith on his milk rounds, and every year he allowed Lennon to place a bet on the Grand National. Smith collapsed and died on a Sunday in 1955 at home of a liver haemorrhage aged 52 and was buried in the graveyard of St. Peter's Church, Woolton, in the Smith family grave. At the time of Smith's death, the fourteen year old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, and was not informed until he returned home. Lennon's first reaction was to laugh hysterically, but then to privately grieve and cry, . He would do the same after hearing about the death of his mother three years later, and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe The Beatles' first bass player , which, with Smith's death, were all major factors in Lennon's early life. In the same year as Smiths death, the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, just three quarters of a mile 1.2 km from Mendips. Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney for the first time at St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried. After Smith's death, Lennon insisted on wearing a large overcoat that had belonged to Smith, and even though it became worn and threadbare, Lennon wore it throughout his art college years. Mimi never used the downstairs sitting room again after Smith's death, using only the breakfast room and the kitchen, and never replaced the furniture, which became old and faded. Lennon continued to live at Mendips and also for a time with his first wife Cynthia Lennon until his early 20s, before moving to London. When Lennon was living in the United States, he asked his half sister, Julia Dykins, to send the clock that was previously in the living room at Mendips, which had been passed down through Smith's family, and was inscribed with the words George Smith, Woolton Tavern , on a metal plate on the back. In Lennon's last published interview, he said This image of me being an orphan is garbage, because I was well protected by my auntie and uncle and they looked after me very well, thanks . Smith, his wife and Lennon were portrayed in the film Nowhere Boy, by David Threlfall, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Aaron Johnson, which was released in the US on 8 October 2010.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Toogood%20Smith
"George Elsworth Smith 18621905 was an American gambler and Thoroughbred horse racing enthusiast who became a multi millionaire during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Smith was given the nickname Pittsburgh Phil in 1885 by Chicago gambler William Silver Bill Riley to differentiate him from the other Smiths that also frequented Riley's pool halls. Pittsburgh Phil is considered by many handicappers to have been an expert strategist, winning large sums of money at a time when racing statistic publications, such as The Daily Racing Form, were not widely available. At the time of his death from tuberculosis in 1905, he had amassed a fortune worth 3,250,000, which is comparable to US 90,626,852 today. His racing Maxims, published posthumously in 1908, are considered to be the foundations of many modern handicapping strategies and formulas. George Elsworth Smith was born in Sewickley, Pennsylvania in 1862 to Elizabeth Eliza and Christian Smith. The Smith family also included two sisters, Annie and Elizabeth, and another son, William C. Smith, that was a few years younger than George Smith. His mother was originally from Ireland and emigrated to the United States in 1857, and his father was a carpenter from Baden, Germany. Eliza remarried after Christian Smith's death in the early 1870s to retail grocer Edward Downing, who died in the 1880s. She remarried a second time on November 20, 1906 to real estate and coal developer Thomas S. Wood after George Smith's death. George Smith's sister Anne married and had a son named James Christian McGill 18801972 . McGill was orphaned at a young age when his parents died in the mid 1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised, along with his infant sister Eleanor, by Mrs. Smith and George Smith. Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and the reasoning behind his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death. The Smith family initially lived on a small farm in Sewickley, Pennsylvania but moved in 1872 to Allegheny City when George Smith was 10 years old. The Smiths eventually settled in the neighborhood of Pleasant Valley, which was located across the Ohio River from Pittsburgh in the present day city neighborhood of California Kirkbride. George Smith's father died within a year in late 1872 or 1873 , which created financial hardships for his mother and sisters and resulted in George going to work at the age of 12 at the local cork cutting factory possibly Armstrong Cork Co. for 5 per week. Smith was not happy with this occupation, once remarking on the banality of the profession later in life thought could do a little better than cutting corks, inasmuch as knew how to divide six by two. Smith set aside money from his weekly pay after giving the majority to his mother to purchase and train gamecocks, hiding the fowl from his devout Roman Catholic mother and sisters who greatly disapproved of gambling. He also bet on the outcomes of National League baseball games in Pittsburgh pool halls and would attribute his often sizable winnings to pay raises at the cork factory. Most of the pool halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also broadcast horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5 1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won 38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that he could win at horse racing, Smith quit his job at the cork factory and accrued more than 5,000 from betting on horse races in the next two years, hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had become one of the most touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over 100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices. The first horse race that Smith witnessed live was the 1885 Kentucky Derby in which Joe Cotton was the favorite and won at 4 5 odds, but he did not bet on the outcome. Smith decided that the best gambling prospects at the time were in Chicago and made his way to William Silver Bill Riley's poolroom in late 1885. Riley was a Civil War veteran from Brooklyn with prematurely gray hair that owned one of the first clubs in Chicago dedicated to betting on horse racing. It was Riley that saddled Smith with the nickname Pittsburgh Phil on their first meeting to differentiate George Smith's bets from the rest of the room full of Smiths. Riley usually named his customers based on their appearances, but by McGill's reckoning he chose the name Pittsburgh Phil because Smith was from Pittsburgh and Phil was short for Philadelphia. Smith quickly gained a reputation as being one of the most successful plungers , or men that bet large sums of money on races, in Chicago. Within a few years, he relocated to New York City and focused most of his betting operations out of New York tracks. Smith also purchased and raced Thoroughbred horses under the name Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two year old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for 4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab. The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won 195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately 115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another 80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner but he had a vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three year old in 1892. Parvenu sired by Uncas, out of Necromancy was purchased by Smith in 1891 as a two year old and was initially considered to be a poor racing prospect by the general public due to his repeated losses early in the season. However, Smith saw potential in the colt and recognized that he could win a large amount of money if the horse could win a race against high odds. On August 29, 1892, Parvenu was entered in a race at Sheepshead Bay and was given 30 1 initial odds by bookmakers, which would have won Smith close to 300,000. However all bets had to be rescinded before the start of the race because there was a miscalculation of the horse handicapping weights, causing the odds on Parvenu to drop to 10 1 in the new pool. As a result, Smith only won 50,000. But despite this mishap, Smith was rewarded when the horse won nine consecutive races, netting approximately 200,000 before Parvenu was retired at age four due to a spinal injury. Smith employed several jockeys on a race to race basis during his career as a Thoroughbred owner, including Henry Skeets Martin, Fred Taral, Edward Garrison and Samuel Doggett. However, Smith considered Tod Sloan to be the best jockey in his employ and commissioned the rider to race in only his colors from 1895 to 1897. Smith met Sloan in the fall of 1895 at a San Francisco racetrack after Sloan had been suspended for ten days for trying to beat the barrier , or disregarding the starting barrier that had recently been adopted at US tracks. Smith was taken with Sloan's unique riding style, later termed the monkey crouch , that redistributed the rider's weight over the neck and withers and allowed horses to run faster. However, Smith did not trust the bookmakers at the California tracks and suspected them, as well as the trainers, of rampant cheating and paying off jockeys to not win on certain horses. Consequently, Smith paid Sloan 500 for every race he won, insuring that his jockey would always be trying to win on any of Smith's mounts. Sloan returned to New York with Smith in 1896 where he became one of the top jockeys on the east coast, giving Smith the most profitable years of his career. Smith soon tired of Sloan's off track antics, which included lavish parties and often arrogant statements that questioned Smith's judgment on the track. A case in point was Sloan's behavior prior to the running of 1897 Brooklyn Handicap which occurred over a sloppy, mud laden track that year. Sloan had won several races on Belmar, a gray 5 year old by Belvidere, and felt confident that the horse would win the Brooklyn Handicap, openly criticizing Smith's choice of Howard Mann in front of his other employees. However, Smith knew that Belmar was not a fast runner in the mud and that Sloan would not push the horse to win because he disliked being splattered with mud. Smith instead put Skeets Martin, who was better at racing on sloppy tracks, on the 4 year old Howard Mann. He advised Martin to, Use your own judgment with this horse, and don't bother about Belmar. Tod probably won't be anywhere near you after the first hundred yards. Howard Mann won easily, winning 50,000 for Smith, while Belmar finished in 8th place. When James R. Keene asked Smith in late 1897 for permission to take Sloan to England to race in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, Smith accepted the offer. Sloan achieved great success while racing in England, but he lost his racing license permanently in 1900. Sloan and Smith remained friends after dissolving their partnership, the later loaning Sloan 5,000 without interest after his license was revoked. After Sloan's departure, Smith used Skeets Martin as his principal jockey, but in 1899 Martin also left the US for better racing prospects in England. Willie Shaw was ultimately hired to replace Sloan and raced for Smith from 1899 until 1903. Smith kept few horses in 1902 and consequently allowed James R. Keene to employ Willie Shaw for much of the season. While his overall percentage of wins was still high, Shaw lost some races in a way that the general public thought was suspicious and he was accused of not trying to win. Shaw's poor performance was soon linked to some action on Smith's part and he was accused of paying the jockey to lose, a claim which Smith vehemently denied. In May 1903, Shaw was suspended by The Jockey Club for presumed listless riding on Illyria at a May 6 race at the Jamaica Racetrack. On June 24, 1903, Smith was also banned from entering his horses in races overseen by The Jockey Club. He admitted to no wrongdoing, and he suspected the ban was a hold over from Willie Shaw's suspension and resulted from The Jockey Club's increased efforts to remove plungers from their tracks. Smith continued to make bets, notably securing 60,000 when Africander won the 1903 Suburban Handicap, but had sold his stable to E.E Smatters by the end of the year. Smith lived in moderation compared to other horsemen of the era, with the only outward display of ostentation being a diamond ring that he would wear to track engagements. Smith also did not smoke and only drank an occasional glass of wine. He socialized with very few women and was considered to be a confirmed bachelor by his family. He was adamant about not bringing women to racetracks, even his own mother, including a reference to their distracting influence on men in his Maxims. However, Smith did court Daisy Dixon, an aspiring actress and chorus girl from Chicago, in 1896. The courtship turned sour after he caught her cavorting with his jockey and notorious ladies man Tod Sloan. Dixon later married fellow gambler, Riley Grannan, who eventually died broke in Rawhide, Nevada in 1908. According to McGill, Smith never had an interest in another woman after Dixon's betrayal. Smith took notice of every detail in horse racing. He kept detailed notes of which horses were good runners during muddy conditions and always inspected horses at the end of a race to look for subtle signs of lameness or impediments i.e. loose girth straps that may have negatively impacted a horse's speed. As he became more famous and seemingly successful, bookmakers would often refuse to place his bets outright for fear of losing money when he won. As a result, Smith conducted most of his betting through beards , or men that he would commission to place bets for him. Smith tried to keep the identity of his beards a secret and never revealed their identities, even to his other commissioners. His movements were continuously followed by agents for the bookmakers and by the Pinkerton detectives employed by The Jockey Club. Smith rarely wrote down his bets and relied on his memory to serve him when he won and had to collect his money from the numerous commissioners that placed his bets with the bookmakers. By the fall of 1903, Smith began curtailing his turf activities for frequent trips to the Adirondacks and Hot Springs to rest. His family assumed that his nerves were affected from the stress of his and Shaw's suspension from racing, but Smith had also developed a persistent cough by the early months of 1904. He made his last bet, 4 1 on High Chancellor, at the Sheepshead Bay racetrack during the summer of 1904 and won 2,000. In October 1904, Smith traveled to the Winyah Sanitarium in Asheville, North Carolina for treatment of his worsening cough, a result of advanced tuberculosis. George E. Smith died at the sanitarium on February 1, 1905. His death was attributed to shattering of his nerves , instead of tuberculosis, due to his habit of never showing emotion. Smith was interred in Union Dale Cemetery in Pittsburgh, a short distance from his childhood home in Allegheny. His funeral occurred on February 5 during a snowstorm and was attended by many people. He was entombed in a stone mausoleum that reportedly cost 30,000 to build and was built to Smith's specifications seven years before his death. His mother later commissioned a statue in his likeness and placed it on top of the mausoleum. The statue depicts Smith, hatless and wearing a suit, looking toward Pittsburgh while clutching a racing form. Smith's net worth, including real estate and stocks and bonds, was 3,250,000, and as he had no will his estate was divided equally among his mother, brother, nephew James McGill and niece Eleanor Ewing . William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for 150,000. George Smith, the 1916 Kentucky Derby winner, was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had once owned the colt's dam, Consuelo II. His racing Maxims, gleaned from his only interview with Edward Cole a few years before his death, are still considered valid by modern handicappers. Media related to George E.

"Ian Scott Smith 31 October 1903 18 September 1972 was a rugby union wing who played 32 Tests for Scotland and two Tests for the British Isles. Born in Melbourne, Australia, and brought up in New Zealand, Smith moved to England and was educated at Winchester College, before studying at Oxford University and later Edinburgh University. At Oxford he took up rugby and was eventually selected for Scotland, for whom he was eligible because of his Scottish parents. He toured with the British Isles now known as the British and Irish Lions to South Africa in 1924, and played all four matches in Scotland's first ever Five Nations Grand Slam in 1925. He represented Scotland until 1933 when he captained them in their Triple Crown winning season. His 24 international tries, all scored in the Five Nations or Home Nations, was an international record until 1987 and a record for the Five Six Nations until 2011. Smith holds joint possession of the Scottish record to this day. Rugby author Richard Bath wrote of him A member of the famous Oxford quartet of Wallace, Aitken, Macpherson and Smith, the lithe Australian born wing made his mark as an integral member of the outstanding sides of the 1920s, which won the Grand Slam in 1925, the year when he scored an astounding eight tries in the first two internationals of the season against France and Wales. Smith was born in Melbourne in Australia in 1903, but was brought up in New Zealand. He was educated at Winchester College, where they did not play rugby, and then went to Oxford University. It was at Oxford that he was persuaded to play rugby by GPS Macpherson. Up until then he had only played association football. Macpherson captained Oxford when Smith played in the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1923 Smith scored two tries in Oxford's victory. Smith had Scottish parents and ancestors from the Borders region, and so was eligible to play for Scotland. He was first capped for Scotland when he faced Wales on 2 February 1924, and he scored three tries on Test debut a 3510 victory. He played in Scotland's remaining 1924 Five Nations matches against Ireland and a Calcutta Cup match against England although he was unable to score again. In 1924 he was invited to play for the Barbarians for their annual encounter with East Midlands for the Mobbs Memorial Match. Smith scored one of five tries for the Barbarians during the game to win 153. He played in a total of six matches for the Barbarians, including five games during the club's 1923 and 1924 Easter tours. In the second half of 1924 he was selected to tour South Africa with the British Isles. It was on this tour that the British Isles were first given the Lions nickname. Smith played in the first two Tests of the tour, both of them lost. He also played four non Test matches during the tour, including one against Rhodesia where he scored two tries. Rowe Harding, an opponent with Wales and a team mate with the 1924 Lions, reckoned Smith to be the greatest wing of all time . In 1925 Smith played in all four of Scotland's Five Nations matches. The first was against France at Inverleith, where Smith scored four tries, and helped them to win 254. He then played against Wales at Swansea and scored another four tries Scotland again won, this time 2414. Their third game of the Championship was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, and although Smith was unable to score this time, Scotland still won 148. Scotland's last match of the Championship was against England at Murrayfield Stadium. This was the first match ever played at Murrayfield, and was watched by over 70,000 spectators. Although Smith did not score himself, he was involved in a crucial Scottish try the ball was passed through several hands before Smith passed to Johnnie Wallace who scored in the right hand corner. English supporters claimed Smith had put his foot into touch, but the Welsh referee disagreed and awarded the try. Eventually Scotland triumphed 1411 to go undefeated and claim their first ever Five Nations Grand Slam. Smith's eight tries for a single Championship equalled the record set by Cyril Lowe in 1914 and remains an individual record as of 2014. He continued to play for Scotland throughout the 1920s. He played all four Scotland matches in the 1926 Five Nations, and scored two tries against England at Twickenham his only tries of the Championship. He played three matches in 1927, this times scoring four tries, two against France and two against England. In both 1926 and 1927 Scotland shared the Five Nations Championship with Ireland. Smith did not play in 1928, but returned in 1929, when Scotland won the Five Nations again. He played all four matches, and scored three tries, two against England. In 1930 he played three Five Nations' matches, missing the England game, and did not score any tries. He did play all four matches in 1931, and scored his only tries of the Championship in the game against England. This was the fourth time he scored two tries in a match against England. In January 1932 Smith played for Scotland against South Africa, which was won 63 by South Africa. By 1932 France had been ejected from the Championship due to allegations of professionalism, and the four Home Nations returned to only playing one another for the International Championship. Smith played all three matches in 1932, but scored only once, against England. In 1933, Smith captained Scotland for the Home Nations Championship. Because of his background of playing association football, team mate James Henderson said of Smith He was great, of course, 'The Flying Scotsman', but when he was our captain in the 1933 Triple Crown success, we never had team talks before the game. He would just tell us to get on with it no great plans or anything, because he didn't know much about the game. Smith played in all three matches during the Championship, and scored one try when they played Wales in February. They played Ireland last after the planned match had been cancelled because of a blizzard. They won the match 86 and secured the Championship and the Triple Crown. It was Smith's last match for Scotland. He studied accounting at the University of Edinburgh, and served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps during the Second World War. Following the war he practised law, before retiring to Kelso in the Scottish Borders. In 2013 Smith was included in the second group of inductees into the Scottish Rugby Hall of Fame. Smith played a total of 32 Tests for Scotland, and scored 24 tries, which still gives him a share of the Scottish record with Tony Stanger. Smith's record for international tries was not beaten until 1987 when it was overtaken by Australian David Campese. Remarkably, Smith's first 17 tries were scored in only 14 Test matches. His 24 career tries in the Five Nations now Six Nations remained a record until first equalled and then surpassed by Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll in 2011. Smith spent much of his playing career playing in the backline with GPS Macpherson 21 of Smith's 24 Scotland tries were scored outside the three quarter Macpherson. When Smith scored four tries against France in 1925, Macpherson contributed to all those scores. Author Richard Bath wrote An exuberant young man, who once famously drove his car down an Edinburgh pavement after a post international drinking binge, Smith held the record for tries scored 24 , until he was overtaken by Australia's David Campese, 55 years after Smith retired to concentrate on his career as a solicitor.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian%20Smith%20%28Scottish%20rugby%20player%2C%20born%201903%29
"James McCune Smith April 18, 1813 November 17, 1865 was an African American physician, apothecary, abolitionist, and author in New York City. He was the first African American to hold a medical degree and graduated at the top in his class at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. After his return to the United States, he became the first African American to run a pharmacy in that nation. In addition to practicing as a doctor for nearly 20 years at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan, Smith was a public intellectual he contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training. He used his training in medicine and statistics to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society in general. Invited as a founding member of the New York Statistics Society in 1852, which promoted a new science, he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society. But he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local medical associations. He has been most well known for his leadership as an abolitionist a member of the American Anti Slavery Society, with Frederick Douglass he helped start the National Council of Colored People in 1853, the first permanent national organization for blacks. Douglass called Smith the single most important influence on his life. Smith was one of the Committee of Thirteen, who organized in 1850 in New York City to resist the newly passed Fugitive Slave Law by aiding refugee slaves through the Underground Railroad. Other leading abolitionist activists were among his friends and colleagues. From the 1840s, Smith lectured on race and abolitionism and wrote numerous articles to refute racist ideas about black capacities. Both Smith and his wife were of mixed race African and European ancestry. As he became economically successful, Smith built a house in a mostly white neighborhood in the 1860 census he and his family were classified as white, along with their neighbors. In 1850 they were classified as mulatto, when living in a predominately African American neighborhood. Smith served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York. After it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots, in which nearly 100 blacks were killed, Smith moved his family and practice to Brooklyn for their safety. Many other blacks left Manhattan for Brooklyn at the same time. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued to be classified as white. To escape racial discrimination and have more opportunities, his children passed into white society the four surviving sons married white spouses his unmarried daughter lived with a brother. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people. Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African American doctor were rediscovered by 20th century historians. They were relearned by his descendants in the twenty first century, who identified as white and did not know about him, when a three times great granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother's family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African American ancestry. Smith was born into slavery in 1813 in New York City and was set free on July 4, 1827, at age 14, by the Emancipation Act of New York. That was the final date when New York officially freed its remaining slaves. His mother was an enslaved woman named Lavinia who achieved her freedom later in life in 1855, Smith described her as a self emancipated woman. She was born into slavery in South Carolina and had been brought to New York as a slave. His father was Samuel Smith, a white merchant and his mother's master, who had brought her with him to New York from South Carolina. The boy grew up only with his mother. As an adult, James Smith alluded to other white ancestry through his mother's family, saying he had kin in the South, some of whom were slaveholders and others slaves. Smith attended the African Free School AFS 2 on Mulberry Street in Manhattan, where he was described as an exceptionally bright student . He was among numerous boys from the school who went on to have brilliant careers, some of whom he worked with as adults in the abolitionist cause. In the course of his studies, Smith was tutored by Rev. Peter Williams, Jr., a graduate of the African Free School who had been ordained in 1826 as the second African American priest in the Episcopal Church. Upon graduation, he applied to Columbia University and Geneva Medical College in New York State, but was denied admission due to racial discrimination. Williams encouraged Smith to attend the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and abolitionist benefactors of the AFS provided Smith with money for his trip overseas and his education. Smith kept a journal of his sea voyage that expressed his sense of mission. After arriving in Liverpool and walking along the waterfront, he thought, I am free Through abolitionist connections, he was welcomed there by members of the London Agency Anti Slavery Society. According to the historian Thomas M. Morgan, Smith enjoyed the relative racial tolerance in Scotland and England, which officially abolished slavery in 1833. New York abolished all slavery in 1827. He studied and graduated at the top of his class. He obtained a bachelor's degree in 1835, a master's degree in 1836, and a medical degree in 1837. He completed an internship in Paris. After his return to New York and getting established, in the early 1840s Smith married Malvina Barnet, a free woman of color who was a graduate of the Rutger Female Institute. They had eleven children and five survived to adulthood. The name of one of the children is unknown By 1860, Smith was doing very well he had moved to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real property was worth 25,000. His household included a live in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell should be Hewlitt, as above , 50. These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change. No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator totals of white persons only are given at the bottom of the page. After the New York City draft riots in 1863, Smith and his family were among prominent African Americans who left Manhattan and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in their old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina now a widow and their four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were classified as white. Their son James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15 Donald, 12 John, 10 and Guy, 8 all were attending school. These five Smith children survived to adulthood James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 onward. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people. Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African American doctor were rediscovered by 20th century historians. They were relearned by his descendants in the twenty first century, who identified as white and did not know about him with the passage of generations. A three times great granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother's family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African American ancestry. When Smith returned to New York City in 1837 with his degrees, he was greeted as a hero by the black community. He said at a gathering, I have striven to obtain education, at every sacrifice and every hazard, and to apply such education to the good of our common country. He was the first university trained African American physician in the United States. During his practice of 25 years, he was also the first black to have articles published in American medical journals, but he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or to local ones. He established his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating both black and white patients. He started a school in the evenings, teaching children. He established what has been called the first black owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway near present day Foley Square . His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism. In 1846, Smith was appointed as the only doctor of the Colored Orphan Asylum also known as the Free Negro Orphan Asylum , at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue. Before that time, the directors had depended on pro bono services of doctors. He worked there for nearly 20 years. The asylum was founded in 1836 by Anna and Hannah Shotwell and Mary Murray, Quaker philanthropists in New York. Trying to protect the children, Smith regularly gave vaccinations for smallpox. Leading causes of death were infectious diseases measles for which there was no vaccine , smallpox, and tuberculosis for which there was no antibiotic at the time . In addition to caring for orphans, the home sometimes boarded children temporarily when their parents were unable to support them, as jobs were scarce for free blacks in New York. Waves of immigration from Ireland and Germany in the 1840s and 1850s meant that many new immigrants were competing for work. Smith was always working for the asylum. In July 1852, he presented the trustees with 5,000 acres provided by his friend Gerrit Smith, a wealthy white abolitionist. The land was to be held in trust and later sold for benefit of the orphans. While in Scotland, Smith joined the Glasgow Emancipation Society and met people in the Scottish and English abolitionist movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery. When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States. He worked effectively with both black and white abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846 65. Publishing lectures quickly brought him to the attention of the national abolitionist movement. His Destiny of the People of Color , Freedom and Slavery for Africans , and A lecture on the Haitian Revolution with a note on Toussaint L'Ouverture , established him as a new force in the field. He directed the Colored People's Educational Movement to the memory of Abraham Lincoln . In 1850, as a member of the Committee of Thirteen, Smith was one of the key organizers of resistance in New York City to the newly passed Fugitive Slave Act, which required states to aid federal law enforcement in capturing escaped slaves. As did similar groups in Boston, his committee aided fugitive slaves to escape capture and helped connect them to people of the Underground Railroad and other escape routes. During the mid 1850s, Smith worked with Frederick Douglass to establish the National Council of Colored People, one of the first permanent black national organizations, beginning with a three day convention in Rochester, New York. At the convention in Rochester, he and Douglass emphasized the importance of education for their race and urged the founding of more schools for black youth. Smith wanted choices available for both industrial and classical education. Douglass valued his rational approach and said that Smith was the single most important influence on his life. Smith tempered the more radical people in the abolitionist movement and insisted on arguing from facts and analysis. He wrote a regular column in Douglass' paper, published under the pseudonym, 'Communipaw.' Opposing the emigration of American free blacks to other countries, Smith believed that native born Americans had the right to live in the United States and a claim by their labor and birth to their land. He gathered supporters to go to Albany to testify to the state legislature against proposed plans to support the American Colonization Society, which had supported sending free blacks to the colony of Liberia in Africa. He contributed money to revive the Weekly Anglo African in 1861, as an anti emigrationist newspaper. In the mid 1850s, Smith joined James W.C. Pennington and other black leaders in establishing the Legal Rights Association LRA in New York City. A pioneering minority rights association, the LRA waged a nearly ten year campaign against segregated public transportation in New York City. This organization successfully defeated segregation in New York and served as a model for later rights organizations, including the National Equal Rights League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP , founded in the early 20th century. In July 1863, during the New York Draft Riots, Irish rioters attacked blacks throughout the city and burned down the orphan asylum. The children were saved by the staff and Union troops in the city. During its nearly 30 years, the orphan asylum had admitted 1310 children, and typically had about 200 in residence at a time. After the riots, Smith moved his family and business out of Manhattan to Brooklyn, as did other prominent blacks. Numerous buildings had been destroyed in their old neighborhoods, and estimates were that some 100 blacks were killed in the rioting. No longer feeling safe in the lower Fourth Ward, the Smiths moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Smith was a prolific writer and essayist. The historian John Stauffer of Harvard University says He was one of the leaders within the movement to abolish slavery, and he was one of the most original and innovative writers of his time. In 1839, he followed Samuel Cornish as editor of The Colored American, a New York weekly newspaper owned by Philip Alexander Bell. Among his notable writings was a debate with John Hughes, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, who was known as a racist and anti abolitionist. In 1840, Smith wrote the first case report by a black doctor, which his associate John Watson read at a meeting of the New York Medical and Surgical Society. It acknowledged that Smith was qualified, but would not admit him because of racial discrimination. Soon after, Smith published an article in the New York Journal of Medicine, the first by a black doctor in the US. He drew from his medical training to discredit popular ideas about differences among the races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so called scientific practice of the time that was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, Smith was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination. In Glasgow, he was trained in the emerging science of statistics. He published numerous articles applying his statistical training. For example, he used statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners, who wrote that blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than were free blacks or white urban laborers. To do this, he drew up statistical tables of data from the census. When John C. Calhoun, then U.S. Secretary of State and former US Senator from South Carolina, claimed that freedom was bad for blacks, and that the 1840 U.S. Census showed that blacks in the North had high rates of insanity and mortality, Smith responded with a masterful paper. In A Dissertation on the Influence of Climate on Longevity 1846 , published in Hunt's Merchants' Magazine, Smith analyzed the census both to refute Calhoun's conclusions and to show the correct way to analyze data. He showed that blacks in the North lived longer than slaves, attended church more, and were achieving scholastically at a rate similar to whites. As Smith started publishing, his work was quickly accepted by newer scientific organizations in 1852 Smith was invited to be a founding member of the New York Statistics Institute. In 1854 he was elected as a member by the American Geographical Society founded in New York in 1851 by top scientists as well as wealthy amateurs interested in exploration . The Society recognized him by giving him an award for one of his articles. He joined the New York Historical Society. Among numerous other works supporting abolitionism and dealing with issues related to race, Smith was known for his introduction to Frederick Douglass's second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom 1855 . It expressed the new independence in African American accounts of slavery, compared to earlier works, which had to seek approval for authentication from white abolitionists, as readers rejected some harsh accounts of conditions under slavery. Smith wrote ... the worst of our institutions, in its worst aspect, cannot keep down energy, truthfulness, and earnest struggle for the right. In addition, during the 1850s Smith gained prominence with African American readers and abolitionist readers of all ethnicities for his regularly published often weekly columns in Frederick Douglass Paper. Smith's commentaries on African American culture, local and national politics, and literature and styles of dress made him one of the earliest Black public intellectuals to gain popularity in the U.S. In 1859, Smith published an article using scientific findings and analysis to refute the former president Thomas Jefferson's theories of race, as expressed in his well known Notes on the State of Virginia 1785 . Dr. Vanessa Northington Gamble, a medical doctor and historian at George Washington University, in 2010 noted, As early as 1859, Dr. McCune Smith said that race was not biological but was a social category. He commented on the positive ways that ethnic Africans would influence US culture and society, in music, dance, food, and other elements. His collected essays, speeches and letters have been published as The Works of James McCune Smith Black Intellectual and Abolitionist 2006 , edited by John Stauffer. In 1863 Smith was appointed as professor of anthropology at Wilberforce College, the first African American owned and operated college in the United States. Smith was too ill to take the position. He died two years later, on November 17, 1865, at the age of 52, from congestive heart failure. This was nineteen days before ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery. He was buried at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn. Smith was survived by his widow, Malvina, and five children.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20McCune%20Smith
"Joseph Smith Jr. December 23, 1805 June 27, 1844 was an American religious leader and founder of Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement. When he was 24, Smith published the Book of Mormon. By the time of his death, 14 years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present. Smith was born in Sharon, Vermont. By 1817, he had moved with his family to the burned over district of western New York an area of intense religious revivalism during the Second Great Awakening. Smith said he experienced a series of visions, including one in 1820 during which he saw two personages presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ , and another in 1823 in which an angel directed him to a buried book of golden plates inscribed with a Judeo Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the Church of Christ, calling it a restoration of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called Latter Day Saints or Mormons , and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 which renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American Zion. They first gathered in Kirtland, Ohio and established an outpost in Independence, Missouri which was intended to be Zion's center place . During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the Kirtland Temple. The collapse of the church sponsored Kirtland Safety Society Anti Banking Company and violent skirmishes with non Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at Nauvoo, Illinois, where he became a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, Smith and the Nauvoo city council angered non Mormons by destroying a newspaper that had criticized Smith's power and practice of polygamy. Smith was imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, where he was killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse. Smith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings discuss the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to Moses and Elijah, and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church that he organized, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and the Community of Christ. Smith was born on December 23, 1805 in Sharon, Vermont to Lucy Mack Smith and her husband Joseph Sr., a merchant and farmer. Modern DNA testing of Smith's relatives suggests that his family were of Irish descent, as he carried a rare Y DNA marker within Haplogroup R1b which is found almost entirely in people of Northwestern Irish descent. Smith suffered a crippling bone infection when he was seven and, after receiving surgery, used crutches for three years. The family moved to the western New York village of Palmyra in 181617, after an ill fated business venture and three years of crop failures, and they eventually took a mortgage on a 100 acre 40 ha farm in the nearby town of Manchester. The region was a hotbed of religious enthusiasm during the Second Great Awakening. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. His parents disagreed about religion, but the family was caught up in this excitement. Smith said that he became interested in religion by age 12. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations. Years later, Smith stated he had received a vision that resolved his religious confusion. He claimed that while praying in a wooded area near his home in 1820, God and Jesus Christ, in a vision, appeared to him and told him his sins were forgiven and that all contemporary churches had turned aside from the gospel. Smith said he recounted the experience to a preacher, who dismissed the story with contempt. The event would later grow in importance to Smith's followers, who now regard it as the first event in the gradual restoration of Christ's church to earth. Until the 1840s, however, the experience was largely unknown, even to most Mormons. Smith may have originally understood the event simply as a personal conversion. According to his later accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying one night in 1823. Smith said that this angel revealed the location of a buried book made of golden plates, as well as other artifacts, including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had been hidden in a hill near his home. Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but, until the fourth and final visit, each time he returned without the plates. Meanwhile, the Smith family faced financial hardship, due in part to the death of Smith's oldest brother Alvin, who had assumed a leadership role in the family. Family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers, a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period. Smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by looking into a seer stone, which he also used in treasure hunting, including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in Chenango County, New York. In 1826, Smith was brought before a Chenango County court for glass looking , or pretending to find lost treasure. The result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes. While boarding at the Hale house in Harmony, Pennsylvania, Smith met and began courting Emma Hale. When Smith proposed marriage, Emma's father, Isaac Hale objected, primarily because he believed Smith had no means to support Emma. Smith and Emma eloped and married on January 18, 1827, after which the couple began boarding with Smith's parents in Manchester. Later that year, when Smith promised to abandon treasure seeking, Hale offered to let the couple live on his property in Harmony and help Smith get started in business. Smith made his last visit to the hill on September 22, 1827, taking Emma with him. This time, he said he successfully retrieved the plates. He said the angel commanded him not to show the plates to anyone else, but to translate them and publish their translation. Smith said the translation was a religious record of indigenous Americans, and were engraved in an unknown language, called reformed Egyptian. He also told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them. Although Smith had left his treasure hunting company, his former associates believed he had double crossed them and taken the golden plates for himself, which they believed should be joint property. After they ransacked places where they believed the plates could be hidden, Smith decided to leave Palmyra. In October 1827, Joseph and Emma moved from Palmyra to Harmony now Oakland , Pennsylvania, aided by a relatively prosperous neighbor, Martin Harris. Living near his in laws, Smith transcribed some characters that he said were engraved on the plates and then dictated a translation to Emma. In February 1828, Martin Harris arrived to assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris also took a sample of the characters to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he was the victim of a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe. However, by June 1828, Harris began having doubts about the project, fueled in part by his wife's skepticism. Harris convinced Smith to let him take the existing 116 pages of manuscript to Palmyra to show a few family members, including his wife. Harris lost the manuscript, of which there was no other copy. As punishment for losing the manuscript, Smith said that the angel returned and took away the plates, and revoked his ability to translate. During this period, Smith briefly attended Methodist meetings with his wife, until a cousin of hers objected to inclusion of a practicing necromancer on the Methodist class roll. Smith said that the angel returned the plates to him in September 1828. In April 1829, he met Oliver Cowdery, who replaced Harris as his scribe, and resumed dictation. They worked full time on the manuscript between April and early June 1829, and then moved to Fayette, New York, where they continued to work at the home of Cowdery's friend, Peter Whitmer. When the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other. Dictation was completed about July 1, 1829. Although Smith had previously refused to show the plates to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer that they would be allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel Moroni took back the plates once Smith finished using them. The completed work, titled the Book of Mormon, was published in Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized the Church of Christ, and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book of Mormon brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, he was arrested and brought to trial as a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, Smith said that Peter, James, and John had appeared to him and had ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood. Smith's authority was undermined when Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, and other church members also claimed to receive revelations. In response, Smith dictated a revelation which clarified his office as a prophet and an apostle, and which declared that only he held the ability to give doctrine and scripture for the entire church. Shortly after the conference, Smith dispatched Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and others on a mission to proselytize Native Americans. Cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the New Jerusalem. On their way to Missouri, Cowdery's party passed through northeastern Ohio, where Sidney Rigdon and over a hundred followers of his variety of Campbellite Restorationism converted to Mormonism, more than doubling the size of the church. Rigdon soon visited New York and quickly became Smith's primary assistant. With growing opposition in New York, Smith gave a revelation stating that Kirtland was the eastern boundary of the New Jerusalem, and that his followers must gather there. When Smith moved to Kirtland, Ohio in January 1831, he encountered a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts, including fits and trances, rolling on the ground, and speaking in tongues. Smith brought the Kirtland congregation under his own authority and tamed these outbursts. Rigdon's followers had also been practicing a form of communalism, which Smith adopted, calling it the United Order. Smith had promised church elders that in Kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power, and at the June 1831 general conference, he introduced the greater authority of a High Melchizedek Priesthood to the church hierarchy. Converts poured into Kirtland. By the summer of 1835, there were fifteen hundred to two thousand Mormons in the vicinity, many expecting Smith to lead them shortly to the Millennial kingdom. Though his mission to the Indians had been a failure, Cowdery reported that he had found the site of the New Jerusalem in Jackson County, Missouri. After Smith visited in July 1831, he agreed, pronouncing the frontier hamlet of Independence the center place of Zion. Rigdon, however, disapproved, and for most of the 1830s the church remained divided between Ohio and Missouri. Smith continued to live in Ohio, but visited Missouri again in early 1832 to prevent a rebellion of prominent church members who believed the church in Missouri was being neglected. Smith's trip was also hastened by a mob of Ohio residents who were incensed over the United Order and Smith's political power the mob beat Smith and Rigdon unconscious, tarred and feathered them, and left them for dead. In Jackson County, existing Missouri residents resented the Mormon newcomers for both political and religious reasons. Tension increased until July 1833, when non Mormons forcibly evicted the Mormons and destroyed their property. Smith advised them to bear the violence patiently until after they were attacked multiple times, after which they could fight back. After armed bands exchanged fire, killing one Mormon and two non Mormons, the old settlers brutally expelled the Mormons from the county. Smith ended the communitarian experiment and changed the name of the church to the Church of Latter Day Saints, before leading a small paramilitary expedition called Zion's Camp, to aid the Missouri Mormons. As a military endeavor, the expedition was a failure the men were outnumbered and suffered from dissension and a cholera outbreak. Nevertheless, Zion's Camp transformed Mormon leadership, and many future church leaders came from among the participants. After the Camp returned, Smith drew heavily from its participants to establish five governing bodies in the church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied. In late 1837, a series of internal disputes led to the collapse of the Kirtland Mormon community. Smith was blamed for having promoted a church sponsored bank that failed. He was also being accused by Assistant President of the Church Oliver Cowdery of engaging in a sexual relationship with a teenage servant in his home, Fanny Alger. Building the temple had left the church deeply in debt, and Smith was hounded by creditors. Having heard of a large sum of money supposedly hidden in Salem, Massachusetts, Smith traveled there and received a revelation that God had much treasure in this city . After a month, however, he returned to Kirtland empty handed. In January 1837, Smith and other church leaders created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society Anti Banking Company, to act as a quasi bank the company issued bank notes capitalized in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838. By 1838, Smith had abandoned plans to redeem Zion in Jackson County, and after Smith and Rigdon arrived in Missouri, the town of Far West became the new Zion . In Missouri, the church also took the name Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , and construction began on a new temple. In the weeks and months after Smith and Rigdon arrived at Far West, thousands of Latter Day Saints followed them from Kirtland. Smith encouraged the settlement of land outside Caldwell County, instituting a settlement in Adam ondi Ahman, in Daviess County. During this time, a church council expelled many of the oldest and most prominent leaders of the church, including John Whitmer, David Whitmer, W. W. Phelps, and Oliver Cowdery. Smith explicitly approved of the expulsion of these men, who were known collectively as the dissenters . Political and religious differences between old Missourians and newly arriving Mormon settlers provoked tensions between the two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti Mormon militia units. Though it is unclear how much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county. In a speech given at the town's Fourth of July celebration, Rigdon declared that Mormons would no longer tolerate persecution by the Missourians and spoke of a war of extermination if Mormons were attacked. Smith implicitly endorsed this speech, and many non Mormons understood it to be a thinly veiled threat. They unleashed a flood of anti Mormon rhetoric in newspapers and in stump speeches given during the 1838 election campaign. On August 6, 1838, non Mormons in Gallatin tried to prevent Mormons from voting, and the election day scuffles initiated the 1838 Mormon War. Non Mormon vigilantes raided and burned Mormon farms, while Danites and other Mormons pillaged non Mormon towns. In the Battle of Crooked River, a group of Mormons attacked the Missouri state militia, mistakenly believing them to be anti Mormon vigilantes. Governor Lilburn Boggs then ordered that the Mormons be exterminated or driven from the state . On October 30, a party of Missourians surprised and killed seventeen Mormons in the Haun's Mill massacre. The following day, the Latter Day Saints surrendered to 2,500 state troops and agreed to forfeit their property and leave the state. Smith was immediately brought before a military court, accused of treason, and sentenced to be executed the next morning Alexander Doniphan, who was Smith's former attorney and a brigadier general in the Missouri militia, refused to carry out the order. Smith was then sent to a state court for a preliminary hearing, where several of his former allies testified against him. Smith and five others, including Rigdon, were charged with overt acts of treason , and transferred to the jail at Liberty, Missouri, to await trial. Smith's months in prison with an ill and whining Rigdon strained their relationship. Meanwhile Brigham Young, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, rose to prominence when he organized the move of about 14,000 Mormon refugees to Illinois and eastern Iowa. Smith bore his imprisonment stoically. Understanding that he was effectively on trial before his own people, many of whom considered him a fallen prophet, he wrote a personal defense and an apology for the activities of the Danites. The keys of the kingdom, he wrote, have not been taken away from us . Though he directed his followers to collect and publish their stories of persecution, he also urged them to moderate their antagonism toward non Mormons. On April 6, 1839, after a grand jury hearing in Davis County, Smith and his companions escaped custody, almost certainly with the connivance of the sheriff and guards. Many American newspapers criticized Missouri for the Haun's Mill massacre and the state's expulsion of the Latter Day Saints. Illinois accepted Mormon refugees who gathered along the banks of the Mississippi River, where Smith purchased high priced, swampy woodland in the hamlet of Commerce. Smith also attempted to portray the Latter Day Saints as an oppressed minority, and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations. During the summer of 1839, while Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic, Smith sent Brigham Young and other apostles to missions in Europe, where they made numerous converts, many of them poor factory workers. Smith also attracted a few wealthy and influential converts, including John C. Bennett, the Illinois quartermaster general. Bennett used his connections in the Illinois legislature to obtain an unusually liberal charter for the new city, which Smith named Nauvoo Hebrew , meaning to be beautiful . The charter granted the city virtual autonomy, authorized a university, and granted Nauvoo habeas corpus powerwhich allowed Smith to fend off extradition to Missouri. Though Mormon authorities controlled Nauvoo's civil government, the city promised an unusually liberal guarantee of religious freedom. The charter also authorized the Nauvoo Legion, an autonomous militia whose actions were limited only by state and federal constitutions. Lieutenant General Smith and Major General Bennett became its commanders, thereby controlling by far the largest body of armed men in Illinois. Smith made Bennett Assistant President of the church, and Bennett was elected Nauvoo's first mayor. In 1841, Smith began revealing the doctrine of plural marriage to a few of his closest male associates, including Bennett, who used it as an excuse to seduce numerous women wed and unwed. When embarrassing rumors of spiritual wifery got abroad, Smith forced Bennett's resignation as Nauvoo mayor. In retaliation, Bennett left Smith's following and wrote lurid exposes of life in Nauvoo . The early Nauvoo years were a period of doctrinal innovation. Smith introduced baptism for the dead in 1840, and in 1841, construction began on the Nauvoo Temple as a place for recovering lost ancient knowledge. An 1841 revelation promised the restoration of the fulness of the priesthood and in May 1842, Smith inaugurated a revised endowment or first anointing . The endowment resembled rites of freemasonry that Smith had observed two months earlier when he had been initiated at sight into the Nauvoo Masonic lodge. At first, the endowment was open only to men, who were initiated into a special group called the Anointed Quorum. For women, Smith introduced the Relief Society, a service club and sorority within which Smith predicted women would receive the keys of the kingdom . Smith also elaborated on his plan for a millennial kingdom. No longer envisioning the building of Zion in Nauvoo, Smith viewed Zion as encompassing all of North and South America, with Mormon settlements being stakes of Zion's metaphorical tent. Zion also became less a refuge from an impending tribulation than a great building project. In the summer of 1842, Smith revealed a plan to establish the millennial Kingdom of God, which would eventually establish theocratic rule over the whole earth. By mid 1842, popular opinion had turned against the Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though the evidence was circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. Certain he would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. Rockwell was later tried and acquitted. In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced a reluctant Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to extradite Smith to Missouri on an old charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois. In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress to make Nauvoo an independent territory with the right to call out federal troops in its defense. Smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own independent candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries. In March 1844 following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. Smith said the Council had authority to decide which national or state laws Mormons should obey. The Council was also to select a site for a large Mormon settlement in Texas, California, or Oregon, where Mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control. By early 1844, a rift developed between Smith and a half dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith had proposed marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy. On June 7, the dissidents published the first and only issue of the Nauvoo Expositor, calling for reform within the church and appealing to the political views of the county's other faiths as well as those of former Mormons. The paper decried Smith's new doctrines of many Gods , alluded to Smith's theocratic aspirations, and called for a repeal of the Nauvoo city charter. It also attacked Smith's practice of polygamy, implying that Smith was using religion as a pretext to draw unassuming women to Nauvoo in order to seduce and marry them. Fearing the newspaper would bring the countryside down on the Mormons, the Nauvoo city council declared the Expositor a public nuisance and ordered the Nauvoo Legion to destroy the press. Smith, who feared another mob attack, supported the action, not realizing that destroying a newspaper was more likely to incite an attack than any libel. Destruction of the newspaper provoked a strident call to arms from Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal and longtime critic of Smith. Fearing an uprising, Smith mobilized the Nauvoo Legion on June 18 and declared martial law. Officials in Carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia, and Governor Thomas Ford appeared, threatening to raise a larger militia unless Smith and the Nauvoo city council surrendered themselves. Smith initially fled across the Mississippi River, but shortly returned and surrendered to Ford. On June 23, Smith and his brother Hyrum rode to Carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot. Once the Smiths were in custody, the charges were increased to treason. On June 27, 1844, an armed mob with blackened faces stormed Carthage Jail where Joseph and Hyrum were being held. Hyrum, who was trying to secure the door, was killed instantly with a shot to the face. Smith fired three shots from a pepper box pistol that his friend, Cyrus Wheelock, had lent him, wounding three men, before he sprang for the window. He was shot multiple times before falling out the window, crying, Oh Lord my God He died shortly after hitting the ground, but was shot several more times before the mob dispersed. Five men were later tried for Smith's murder, but were all acquitted. Smith was buried in Nauvoo, and is interred there at the Smith Family Cemetery. After his death, non Mormon newspapers were almost unanimous in portraying Smith as a religious fanatic. Conversely, within Mormonism, Smith was remembered first and foremost as a prophet, martyred to seal the testimony of his faith. Smith attracted thousands of devoted followers before his death in 1844, and millions in the century that followed. Among Mormons, he is regarded as a prophet on par with Moses and Elijah. In a 2015 compilation of the 100 Most Significant Americans of All Time, Smithsonian magazine ranked Smith first in the category of religious figures. Mormons and non Mormons have produced a large amount of scholarly work about Smith, and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people a man of God on the one hand, and on the other, a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers. Believers tend to focus on his achievements and religious teachings, deemphasizing his personal defects, while detractors focus on his mistakes, legal troubles, and controversial doctrines. During the first half of the 20th century, some writers suggested that Smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manic depressive illness that might explain his visions and revelations. Many modern biographers disagree with these ideas. More nuanced interpretations include viewing Smith as a prophet who had normal human weaknesses a pious fraud who believed he was called of God to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people or a gifted mythmaker who was the product of his Yankee environment. Biographers, Mormon and non Mormon alike, agree that Smith was one of the most influential, charismatic, and innovative figures in American religious history. Memorials to Smith include the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Joseph Smith Building on the campus of Brigham Young University, and a granite obelisk marking his birth place. Smith's death resulted in a succession crisis. Smith had proposed several ways to choose his successor, but had never clarified his preference. Smith's brother Hyrum, had he survived, would have had the strongest claim, followed by Smith's brother Samuel, who died mysteriously a month after his brothers. Another brother, William, was unable to attract a sufficient following. Smith's sons Joseph III and David also had claims, but Joseph III was too young and David was yet unborn. The Council of Fifty had a theoretical claim to succession, but it was a secret organization. Some of Smith's chosen successors, such as Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, had left the church. The two strongest succession candidates were Brigham Young, senior member and president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Sidney Rigdon, the senior member of the First Presidency. In a church wide conference on August 8, most of the Latter Day Saints elected Young, who led them to the Utah Territory as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church . Membership in Young's denomination surpassed 14 million members in 2010. Smaller groups followed Sidney Rigdon and James J. Strang, who had based his claim on an allegedly forged letter of appointment. Others followed Lyman Wight and Alpheus Cutler. Many members of these smaller groups, including most of Smith's family, eventually coalesced in 1860 under the leadership of Joseph Smith III and formed what was known for more than a century as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints now the Community of Christ , which now has about 250,000 members. As of 2013 , members of the denominations originating from Smith's teachings number approximately 16.3 million. The first of Smith's wives, Emma Hale, gave birth to nine children during their marriage, five of whom died before the age of two. The eldest, Alvin born in 1828 , died within hours of birth, as did twins Thaddeus and Louisa born in 1831 . When the twins died, the Smiths adopted another set of twins, Julia and Joseph, whose mother had recently died in childbirth Joseph died of measles in 1832. In 1841, Don Carlos, who had been born a year earlier, died of malaria. In 1842, Emma gave birth to a stillborn son. Joseph and Emma had four sons who lived to maturity Joseph Smith III, Frederick Granger Williams Smith, Alexander Hale Smith, and David Hyrum Smith. Some historians have speculatedbased on journal entries and family storiesthat Smith may have fathered children with his plural wives. However, all DNA testing of potential Smith descendants from wives other than Emma has been negative. Throughout her life, Emma Smith frequently denied that her husband had ever taken additional wives. Emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to Smith by Mormons was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's periodical The Seer in 1853. Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy, and was the main signatory of a petition in 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy, and denying her husband as its creator or participant. Even on her deathbed, Emma denied Joseph's involvement with polygamy, stating, No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of ... He had no other wife but me nor did he to my knowledge ever have . After Smith's death, Emma Smith quickly became alienated from Brigham Young and the church leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was suspicious of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion with those of the church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. According to the American historian and Mormonism expert Richard Bushman, the signal feature of Smith's life was his sense of being guided by revelation . Instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments, Smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe. Smith's teachings came primarily through his claimed revelations, which read like scripture oracular and open to interpretation. Smith and his followers viewed his claimed revelations as being above teachings or opinions, and it has been argued that Smith's actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as much as his most loyal followers. Smith claimed that his first recorded revelation was a rebuke from God for having let Martin Harris lose 116 pages of Book of Mormon manuscript, chastising him for fearing man more than God . The revelation was reportedly given in the voice of God rather than as a declaration mediated through Smith and subsequent revelations assumed a similar authoritative style, often opening with words such as Hearken O ye people which profess my name, saith the Lord your God. The Book of Mormon has been called the longest and most complex of Smith's revelations. It is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader. It tells the story of the rise and fall of a religious civilization beginning about 600 BC and ending in 421 AD. The story begins with a family that leaves Jerusalem, just before the Babylonian captivity. They eventually construct a ship and sail to a promised land in the Western Hemisphere. There, they are divided into two factions Nephites and Lamanites. The Nephites become a righteous people who build a temple and live the law of Moses, though their prophets teach a Christian gospel. The book explains itself to be largely the work of Mormon, a Nephite prophet and military figure. The book closes when Mormon's son, Moroni, finishes engraving and buries the records written on the golden plates. Christian themes permeate the work for instance, Nephite prophets in the Book of Mormon teach of Christ's coming, and talk of the star that will appear at his birth. After the crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem, Jesus appears in the Americas, repeats the Sermon on the Mount, blesses children, and appoints twelve disciples. The book ends with Moroni's exhortation to come unto Christ . Early Mormons understood the Book of Mormon to be a religious history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers view it as a companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature. Smith never said how he produced the Book of Mormon, saying only that he translated by the power of God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof . As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For at least some of the earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the Urim and Thummim , a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat, excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 when he said he no longer needed it. Although the Book of Mormon drew many converts to the church, Fawn Brodie argued that the book lives today because of the prophet, not he because of the book. Smith had assumed a role as prophet, seer, and apostle of Jesus Christ, and by early 1831, he was introducing himself as Joseph the Prophet . The language of authority in Smith's revelations was appealing to converts, and the revelations were given with the confidence of an Old Testament prophet. Smith said that in June 1830, he received a revelation of Moses in which Moses saw the world and the ends thereof and asked God questions about the purpose of creation and man's relationship to God. This revelation initiated a revision of the Bible on which Smith worked sporadically until 1833 and which remained unpublished at his death. Smith said that the Bible had been corrupted through the ages, and that his revision worked to restore the original intent it added long passages rewritten according to his inspiration . While many changes involved straightening out seeming contradictions or making small clarifications, other changes added large lost portions to the text. For instance, Smith's revision nearly tripled the length of the first five chapters of Genesis in what would become the Book of Moses. The Book of Moses begins with Moses' asking God about the purpose of creation. Moses is told in this account that God made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life. The book also provides an enlarged account of the Genesis creation narrative and expands the story of Enoch, the ancestor of Noah. In the narrative, Enoch speaks with God, receives a prophetic calling, and eventually builds a city of Zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven. The book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing the coming of Christ, in effect Christianizing the Old Testament. In 1835, Smith encouraged some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland to purchase rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Smith said they contained the writings of the ancient patriarchs Abraham and Joseph. Over the next several years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation of one of these rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book of Abraham. The Book of Abraham speaks of the founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account of the creation story. The papyri from which Smith dictated the Book of Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined to be part of the Book of Breathing with no connection to Abraham. The LDS Church has proposed that Smith might have been inspired by the papyri rather than have been translating them literally, but prominent Egyptologists note that Smith copied characters from the scrolls and was specific about their meaning. Joseph Smith According to Parley P. Pratt, Smith dictated revelations orally, and they were recorded by a scribe without revisions or corrections. Revelations were immediately copied, and then circulated among church members. Smith's revelations often came in response to specific questions. He described the revelatory process as having pure Intelligence flowing into him. Smith, however, never viewed the wording to be infallible. The revelations were not God's words verbatim, but couched in language suitable to Joseph's time . In 1833, Smith edited and expanded many of the previous revelations, publishing them as the Book of Commandments, which later became part of the Doctrine and Covenants. Smith gave varying types of revelations. Some were temporal, while others were spiritual or doctrinal. Some were received for a specific individual, while others were directed at the whole church. An 1831 revelation called The Law contained directions for missionary work rules for organizing society in Zion a reiteration of the Ten Commandments an injunction to administer to the poor and needy and an outline for the law of consecration. An 1832 revelation called The Vision added to the fundamentals of sin and atonement, and introduced doctrines of life after salvation, exaltation, and a heaven with degrees of glory. Another 1832 revelation on Priesthood was the first to explain priesthood doctrine. Three months later, Smith gave a lengthy revelation called the Olive Leaf containing themes of cosmology and eschatology, and discussing subjects such as light, truth, intelligence, and sanctification a related revelation given in 1833 put Christ at the center of salvation. Also in 1833, at a time of temperance agitation, Smith delivered a revelation called the Word of Wisdom, which counseled a diet of wholesome herbs, fruits, grains, a sparing use of meat. It also recommended that Latter Day Saints avoid strong alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and hot drinks later interpreted to mean tea and coffee . The Word of Wisdom was not originally framed as a commandment, but a recommendation. As such, Smith and other Latter Day Saints did not strictly follow this counsel, though it later became a requirement in the LDS Church. In 1835, Smith gave the great revelation that organized the priesthood into quorums and councils, and functioned as a complex blueprint for church structure. Smith's last revelation, on the New and Everlasting Covenant , was recorded in 1843, and dealt with the theology of family, the doctrine of sealing, and plural marriage. Before 1832, most of Smith's revelations dealt with establishing the church, gathering his followers, and building the City of Zion. Later revelations dealt primarily with the priesthood, endowment, and exaltation. The pace of formal revelations slowed during the autumn of 1833, and again after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple. Smith moved away from formal written revelations spoken in God's voice, and instead taught more in sermons, conversations, and letters. For instance, the doctrines of baptism for the dead and the nature of God were introduced in sermons, and one of Smith's most famed statements about there being no such thing as immaterial matter was recorded from a casual conversation with a Methodist preacher. Smith taught that all existence was material, including a world of spirit matter so fine that it was invisible to all but the purest mortal eyes. Matter, in Smith's view, could neither be created nor destroyed the creation involved only the reorganization of existing matter. Like matter, Smith saw intelligence as co eternal with God, and taught that human spirits had been drawn from a pre existent pool of eternal intelligences. Nevertheless, spirits could not experience a fullness of joy unless joined with corporeal bodies, according to Smith. The work and glory of God, then, was to create worlds across the cosmos where inferior intelligences could be embodied. Though Smith initially viewed God the Father as a spirit, he eventually began teaching that God was an advanced and glorified man, embodied within time and space. By the end of his life, Smith was teaching that both God the Father and Jesus were distinct beings with physical bodies, but the Holy Spirit was a personage of Spirit . Through the gradual acquisition of knowledge, according to Smith, those who received exaltation could eventually become like God. These teachings implied a vast hierarchy of gods, with God himself having a father. In Smith's cosmology, those who became gods would reign, unified in purpose and will, leading spirits of lesser capacity to share immortality and eternal life. In Smith's view, the opportunity to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife. Smith's teachings were rooted in dispensational restorationism. He taught that the Church of Christ restored through him was a latter day restoration of the early Christian faith, which had been lost in the Great Apostasy. At first, Smith's church had little sense of hierarchy his religious authority was derived from visions and revelations. Though Smith did not claim exclusive prophethood, an early revelation designated him as the only prophet allowed to issue commandments as Moses . This religious authority encompassed economic and political as well as spiritual matters. For instance, in the early 1830s, he temporarily instituted a form of religious communism, called the United Order, that required Latter Day Saints to give all their property to the church, which was divided among the faithful. He also envisioned that the theocratic institutions he established would have a role in the worldwide political organization of the Millennium. By the mid 1830s, Smith began teaching a hierarchy of three priesthoodsthe Melchizedek, the Aaronic, and the Patriarchal. Each priesthood was a continuation of biblical priesthoods through patrilineal succession or ordination by biblical figures appearing in visions. Upon introducing the Melchizedek or High Priesthood in 1831, Smith taught that its recipients would be endowed with power from on high , thus fulfilling a need for a greater holiness and an authority commensurate with the New Testament apostles. This doctrine of endowment evolved through the 1830s, until in 1842, the Nauvoo endowment included an elaborate ceremony containing elements similar to Freemasonry and the Jewish tradition of Kabbalah. The endowment was extended to women in 1843, though Smith never clarified whether women could be ordained to priesthood offices. Smith taught that the High Priesthood's endowment of heavenly power included the sealing powers of Elijah, allowing High Priests to effect binding consequences in the afterlife. For example, this power would enable proxy baptisms for the dead and priesthood marriages that would be effective into the afterlife. Elijah's sealing powers also enabled the second anointing, or fulness of the priesthood , which, according to Smith, sealed married couples to their exaltation. During the early 1840s, Smith unfolded a theology of family relations called the New and Everlasting Covenant that superseded all earthly bonds. He taught that outside the Covenant, marriages were simply matters of contract, and that in the afterlife individuals married outside the Covenant or not married would be limited in their progression. To fully enter the Covenant, a man and woman must participate in a first anointing , a sealing ceremony, and a second anointing also called sealing by the Holy Spirit of Promise . When fully sealed into the Covenant, Smith said that no sin nor blasphemy other than the eternal sin could keep them from their exaltation in the afterlife. According to Smith, only one person on earth at a timein this case, Smithcould possess this power of sealing. Smith taught that the highest level of exaltation could be achieved through plural marriage polygamy , which was the ultimate manifestation of this New and Everlasting Covenant. Plural marriage, according to Smith, allowed an individual to transcend the angelic state and become a god, accelerating the expansion of one's heavenly kingdom. By some accounts, Smith had been teaching a polygamy doctrine as early as 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged in a relationship with his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as an additional wife. In April 1841, Smith wed Louisa Beaman. During the next two and a half years he married or was sealed to about 30 additional women, ten of whom were already married to other men. Some of these polyandrous marriages were done with the consent of the first husbands, and some plural marriages may have been considered eternity only sealings meaning that the marriage would not take effect until after death . Ten of Smith's plural wives were between the ages of fourteen and twenty others were over fifty. The practice of polygamy was kept secret from both non Mormons and most members of the church during Smith's lifetime. Polygamy caused a breach between Smith and his first wife, Emma. Although Emma knew of some of her husband's marriages, she almost certainly did not know the extent of his polygamous activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith's marriage to four women boarded in the Smith household, but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. In July 1843, Smith dictated a revelation directing Emma to accept plural marriage, but the two were not reconciled until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies. While campaigning for President of the United States in 1844, Smith had opportunity to take political positions on issues of the day. Smith considered the U.S. Constitution, and especially the Bill of Rights, to be inspired by God and the Saints' best and perhaps only defense. . He believed a strong central government was crucial to the nation's well being and thought democracy better than tyrannyalthough he also taught that a theocratic monarchy was the ideal form of government. In foreign affairs, Smith was an expansionist, though he viewed expansionism as brotherhood . Smith favored a strong central bank and high tariffs to protect American business and agriculture. He disfavored imprisonment of convicts except for murder, preferring efforts to reform criminals through labor he also opposed courts martial for military deserters. He supported capital punishment but opposed hanging, preferring execution by firing squad or beheading. On the issue of slavery, Smith took different positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid 1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri a slave state , Smith cautiously justified slavery in an anti abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage. Smith declared that he would be one of the instruments in fulfilling Nebuchadnezzar's statue vision in the Book of Daniel that secular government would be destroyed without sword or gun , and would be replaced with a theodemocratic Kingdom of God. Smith taught that this kingdom would be governed by theocratic principles, but that it would also be multidenominational and democratic, so long as the people chose wisely.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%20Smith
"Luke Michael Smith is an American writer. He is a staff member at Bungie, a video game development company, and is a former video games journalist. Smith wrote for a college newspaper and weekly papers in Michigan before being hired as one of the first new freelance writers for Kotaku. At Kotaku, Smith developed his writing style but soon left the site for a staff position as 1UP.com's news editor. Smith made a name for himself at 1UP, particularly through an article he wrote focusing on problems with the game Halo 2. Smith was known for his direct approach to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry. During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co host of the developer's podcast. Smith gradually entered into game journalism while working on an English Literature degree at the University of Michigan, writing about media in the college newspaper. After graduation, he worked for weekly papers in Dearborn and Detroit, Michigan, including Real Detroit Weekly. Clive Thompson, a games writer with Slate, interacted with Smith over AOL Instant Messenger and the two began to bounce ideas off of each other for their respective writing projects when games blog Kotaku started to expand from one writer founder Brian Crecente , Thompson recommended Smith. Smith credits his time at Kotaku for helping him come into his own, develop his style and learn about attribution and citing sources, but he left after a short period of time. At the time stories on Kotaku were unsigned. Kotaku was like the Brian Crecente vision. If I posted something or did people thought did. Also, there was no health insurance, it was just full time freelance. Smith served as the news editor for 1UP.com, the sister site to the magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly. During his tenure at 1UP, Smith wrote extensively about the Halo video game franchise, as was considered a leading fan voice in one article, he declared Halo was the only game series he cared about. Smith wrote a feature story for 1UP in 2005 called Broken Halo , in which he explained how developer Bungie could fix problems he perceived with the game Crecente said the article put Smith on the map . Smith also became one of the panelists of the 1UP Yours show, a weekly video games podcast featuring gaming editors and experts. In 2006, Edge named him one of gaming's top 50 journalists. Play.d magazine credited Smith with inspiring gamers to learn more about the game industry and not accept company promotion, as well as turning 1UP from the bastard child of EGM to an important part of the Ziff Davis Internet company's gaming network. His style has been described as a robust, direct approach to journalism and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry. Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. Video game journalism is just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover. Video game journalism is still very young, very early, still trying to find out what it is, he said. In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist, Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists regurgitating it. Worse, Smith felt that gamers had become used to this sort of information We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers, he told Zenke. While he was becoming more frustrated with the field at 1UP, game developer Bungie contacted Smith about employment. After sending the company his resume, Smith stopped writing about Bungie and Microsoft to avoid a conflict of interest. Smith accepted a job offer a month later. In April 2007, Smith announced on a 1UP podcast he was leaving the site to work for Bungie. Reaction to Smith's announcement varied some were happy or sad to see him leave, while others felt he had sold out.

Bungie staff hinted in a weekly update that Smith might play a role in the developer's podcast. Smith officially began work on May 7, 2007, as content editor, providing fans and the Bungie readership with information about Bungie's game and staff. Smith believed that there was a special opportunity for game developers, for someone to come in and tell the stories that people want to know ... Right now you have four bridges between developer and reader Developer to PR, to journalist to reader. could get rid of those middle two bridges. While Bungie had historically been good at letting fans interact via forums and provided updates and artwork via their site, Bungie, the company's releases had a corporate and muted tone to it, and made less effort and been less successful historically at providing access to the inner workings of the game studio. As part of a change to become more transparent, Bungie took steps repeated throughout the industry to allow fans more say and recruiting respected voices from the communitynamely, Smith.

He is best known for his roles as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in the BBC series Doctor Who and Prince Philip in the Netflix series The Crown, earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the latter. Smith initially aspired to be a professional footballer, but spondylolysis forced him out of the sport. After joining the National Youth Theatre and studying drama and creative writing at the University of East Anglia, he became an actor in 2003, performing in plays like Murder in the Cathedral, Fresh Kills, The History Boys, and On the Shore of the Wide World in London theatres. Extending his repertoire into West End theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of Swimming with Sharks with Christian Slater, followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance as Henry in That Face.

He has a sister named Laura Jayne, who was one of the dancers featured in the well known music video for Eric Prydz's 2004 song Call on Me. Smith attended Northampton School for Boys. His grandfather had played football for Notts County and Smith had also planned to play football, having played for the youth teams of Northampton Town, Nottingham Forest, and Leicester City, becoming captain of the latter's youth team. A serious back injury resulted in spondylosis, and he was unable to continue with a footballing career. Smith's drama teacher introduced him to acting by signing him up for theatrical productions without his consent. After failing to participate on the first two occasions, his teacher arranged that he play the tenth juror in an adaptation of Twelve Angry Men. Although he took part in this play, he refused to attend a drama festival for which his teacher had also signed him up, as he saw himself as a football player and believed acting would damage his social life. His drama teacher persisted, and eventually persuaded him to join the National Youth Theatre in London. After leaving school, Smith studied Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles as part of the National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon in The Master and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year. Smith's first television role was as Jim Taylor in the BBC adaptations of the Sally Lockhart quartet books The Ruby in the Smoke and The Shadow in the North. His first major television role came in the television series Party Animals, a BBC television drama series about fictional parliamentary advisors and researchers in Westminster. In Party Animals, Smith portrays Danny Foster, a parliamentary researcher to Jo Porter Raquel Cassidy , a Labour politician and junior Home Office minister. At 26 years old, Danny is described as an intelligent but timid politics geek who should have moved on from researching at his age. His brother, Scott, a public affairs consultant, is played by Andrew Buchan.Within the series' narrative, he attempts to balance his affections for Kirsty MacKenzie Andrea Riseborough , his intern, while trying to prevent Porter's imminent decline. In an interview in 2007, Smith discussed his character's motivations. He summarised Danny as having a romantic outlook of the political world while being cynical elsewhere. The character was drawn into politics by his father and his own political drive. He defended his character's age by characterising him as being loyal to Porter, instead of being incompetent. He talked about his character's emotional and intellectual maturity emotionally, he lacks confidence around womenmost notably seen with his unrequited love towards Kirstybut Smith portrays Danny as a caring and sensitive but wry, sarcastic, witty romantic and intellectually, Danny is portrayed as attentive and possessing a strong work ethic. Smith auditioned for the role of Will McKenzie in the comedy series The Inbetweeners, with the part eventually being given to actor Simon Bird. This was revealed in an interview in 2009 by the show's writer Iain Morris, who said, We auditioned literally 1,000 people... he was brilliantdown to the last two for Will, I think. I think he was a bit too dashing Executive producer Steven Moffat on Smith's casting. Smith was revealed as the Eleventh Doctor in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who in January 2009 to replace David Tennant, who announced his departure in October 2008. Smith was a relatively unknown actor compared to the actors then speculated about possibly taking on the role, who included Paterson Joseph, David Morrissey, Sean Pertwee, James Nesbitt, Russell Tovey, Catherine Zeta Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Robert Carlyle, and Billie Piper. Smith was first named as a possible successor less than a day before he was announced as the Eleventh Doctor, on edition of 3 January 2009 of BBC Breakfast, among the names speculated about. His obscurity prompted the news headline Doctor Who , a riff on the show's title. Smith was one of the earliest actors to audition for the role, performing on the first day. The production team, consisting of the incoming producer, Steven Moffat, and BBC Wales Head of Drama and executive producer, Piers Wenger, immediately singled him out based on his performance. Smith additionally auditioned for the role of John Watson in the Moffat created Sherlock, undergoing auditions at the same time he was unsuccessful, as Moffat believed his eccentric acting style was closer to Holmes, whose role had already been given to Benedict Cumberbatch. At 26 years old, Smith was three years younger than Peter Davison was at the time of his casting as the Doctor in 1981, and younger than any other actor suggested for the role. After three weeks of auditions, Moffat and Wenger agreed that it had always been Matt and approached him to accept the role. The BBC were cautious about casting him because they felt that a 26 year old could not play the Doctor adequately Wenger shared the same sentiment but thought Smith had proven his acting quality in Party Animals, which Wenger thought highlighted Smith's mercurial qualities . Some fans of the show believed that Smith was inexperienced and too young for the role, while others supported him by citing his demonstrated acting ability. For his performance in his first series, he was nominated in the Outstanding Drama Performance Category of the National Television Awards. Smith is the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA for Best Actor. Smith has said of his character The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's wonderful about him as a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe. In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with Orbital, and performed with them a version of the Doctor Who theme, at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 2425 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the Olympic torch in Cardiff, an activity which was noted by Doctor Who fans for its resemblance to a 2006 episode of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving Doctor Who at the end of the 2013 Christmas special. Upon reflecting on his decision to leave in a 2016 interview, Smith expressed regret for not staying longer, owing to wanting to work longer with co star Jenna Coleman. In 2018, while appearing on Desert Island Discs, Smith revealed that he nearly turned down the role of the Doctor. He was succeeded in 2013 by Peter Capaldi. In June 2015, Smith was cast to portray Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in the Netflix royal drama The Crown. Smith played the role for the series' first two seasons, as the role would be recast every two seasons.

In February 2019, it was announced that he had joined Edgar Wright's Last Night in Soho alongside Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor Joy. During Smith's tenure in On the Shore of the Wide World, the play transferred to the Royal National Theatre in London. After finishing the play, he took on the role of Lockwood, a pupil in the Alan Bennett play The History Boys. After The History Boys, he acted in the teen play Burn Chatroom Citizenship and with Christian Slater in Swimming with Sharks, the latter being his West End debut. In 2007, Smith appeared as Henry in the Polly Stenham play That Face at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in Chelsea. The play transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2008 and became Smith's second role there. That Face focuses primarily upon alcohol and drug addiction in an upper middle class family after the paternal figure in the family leaves. As Henry, Smith portrayed an aspiring artist who left school to take care of his mother. To prepare for the role, the cast interviewed alcoholics and their families.

"Mary Elizabeth Mimi Smith nee Stanley 24 April 1906 6 December 1991 was a maternal aunt and the parental guardian of the English musician John Lennon. Mimi Stanley was born in Toxteth, Liverpool, England, the oldest of five daughters. She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital and later worked as a private secretary. On 15 September 1939 she married George Toogood Smith who ran his family's dairy farm and a shop in Woolton, a suburb of Liverpool. After her younger sister Julia Lennon separated from her husband, Julia and her son, the young John Lennon, moved in with a new partner, but Smith contacted Liverpool's Social Services and complained about his sleeping in the same bed as the two adults. Julia was eventually persuaded to hand over the care of John to the Smiths. He lived with the Smiths for most of his childhood and remained close to his aunt, even though she was highly dismissive of his musical ambitions, his girlfriends and wives. She often told the teenage Lennon The guitar's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it . In 1965, John bought her a bungalow in Poole, Dorset, where she lived until her death in 1991. Despite later losing touch with other family members, he kept in close contact with Mimi and telephoned her every week until his death in 1980. The Smiths' house in Liverpool was later donated to The National Trust. According to Lennon, the Stanley family once owned the whole of Woolton village. William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, did once own the manorial rights to Woolton but Lennon's Stanley family were from humbler origins and only came to Liverpool in the 1870s. Smith's grandfather was born in Birmingham and her great grandfather was born in London. Smith's father, George Ernest Stanley, was born in the Everton district of Liverpool in 1874 to William Henry Stanley and Eliza Jane Gildea. George's mother, Eliza Jane Gildea, was born in Omagh, County Tyrone, Ulster, Ireland. By 1891 the Stanleys were living in Upper Frederick Street, south of the city centre, in the same inner city area of Liverpool as the family of George's future wife, Annie Millward. Smith's mother, Annie Jane Millward, was born in Chester in 1873, to Welsh parents. George Ernest Stanley and Annie Millward were married at St Peter's Church, Liverpool on 19 November 1906. Stanley was a merchant seaman often away at sea so was absent from some census records. George and Annie had five daughters Mary Elizabeth, known as 'Mimi' 1906 to 1991 , born on 24 April 1906, several months before her parents married Elizabeth Jane 'Mater' 1908 to 1976 Annie Georgina 'Nanny' 19111988 Julia 'Judy' 19141958 and Harriet 'Harrie' 19161972 . After the birth of his daughters, Stanley stopped going to sea and got a job with the Liverpool and Glasgow Tug Salvage Company as an insurance investigator. He moved his family to the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road. According to Beatles biographer Bob Spitz, Mimi assumed a matriarchal role in the Stanley house to help her mother, and dressed as if she was on her way to a weekly garden club meeting . Friends of Lennon later stated that his aunt based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black and white attitude Either you were good enough or you were not. Lennon's school friend, Pete Shotton, later commented that she had a very strong sense of what was right or wrong . Annie Stanley died in 1941, so Mimi accepted the responsibility of caring for her father, with help from her younger sister, Julia. When other girls were thinking of marriage, Smith talked of challenges and adventures that arose from her attitude of stubborn independence , and often said that she never wanted to get married because she hated the idea of being tied to the kitchen sink . She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, and later worked as a private secretary for Ernest Vickers, who was an industrial magnate with businesses in Manchester and Liverpool. She had long term plans to buy a house in a respected suburb of Liverpool one day so that she could entertain the scholars and dignitaries of Liverpool society . In early 1932 she met George Smith, who lived across from the hospital where she worked, and to which he delivered milk every morning. Smith and his brother, Frank Smith, operated a dairy farm and a shop in Woolton that had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith started courting Mimi, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. Stanley would only allow the couple to sit in the back room at Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst into the back room and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting. After delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, or nothing at all Mimi and Smith were finally married on 15 September 1939. They bought a semi detached house called Mendips named after the range of hills at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue suffered extensive damage during World War II, and Mimi said that she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war, the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service. However, he was discharged three years later and worked in an aircraft factory in Speke until the end of the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a compulsive gambler and had lost most of their money. Julia Stanley married Alfred Alf or Fred Lennon on 3 December 1938, on 9 October 1940, the couple's first and only child was born. Smith phoned the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital that evening and was told that Julia had given birth to a boy. According to Smith, she went straight to the hospital during the middle of an air raid, and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel. As she later recalled, she ran as fast as my legs could carry me . A parachute borne landmine fell outside the hospital, and Mimi later said My sister stayed in bed, and they put the baby under the bed. They wanted me to go into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran all the way back to Newcastle Road to tell father the news. 'Get under the shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them. The story about the air raid has since been refuted, as there was no attack that night. The previous raid had been on 2122 September, and the next was on 16 October, when the areas of Walton and Everton were badly hit. After Julia separated from her husband, she and the infant Lennon moved in with her new partner, John Albert Bobby Dykins, . However, Smith twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services and complained about John sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins. Julia was eventually persuaded to hand over the care of John to the Smiths, who had no children of their own. Smith later confided to a relative that although she had never wanted children, she had always wanted John . In July 1946, Alf Lennon visited the Smiths and took Lennon to Blackpool, ostensibly for a long holiday, but with the secret intention of emigrating to New Zealand with him. Julia went to Blackpool and took John back to her house, but a few weeks later she handed him back to Smith. John then lived continuously at Mendips in the smallest bedroom, which was located above the front door. Although she was a caring guardian, Smith was also known for being very strict, compared to the more relaxed influence of her husband and John's mother. Family friends described Smith as stubborn, impatient and unforgiving, but also said that she had a strong sense of humour. On many occasions when she criticised John, he would respond with a joke and the two of them would be rolling around, laughing together . Smith bought volumes of short stories for John, and her husband taught him to read at the age of five by reading aloud the headlines of the Liverpool Echo. Every summer, from the age of nine until he was fifteen, John was sent alone on a ten hour bus journey to visit his Aunt Mater and cousin Stanley Parkes at their home near Loch Meadie in Durness, Scotland. Smith also took her charge to a garden party in Calderstones Park every year, where a Salvation Army band played. She remembered John pulling her by the hand to get there, saying, Hurry up Mimi were going to be late . Strawberry Field, in Beaconsfield Road, was the name of a Salvation Army house that Lennon would later immortalise in the Beatles' song, Strawberry Fields Forever . She would later say John loved his uncle George . I felt quite left out of that. They'd go off together, just leaving me a bar of chocolate and a note saying, 'Have a happy day' . Smith's husband George died of a liver haemorrhage in June 1955 leaving 2,000 in his will equivalent to 51,500 in 2019 . The Smiths had rented their two first floor bedrooms to students for extra income since 1947, while the Smiths slept in the former dining room on the ground floor, at the back of the house. Some of the students who lodged there included John Cavill from September 1949 until June 1950 . Cavill played piano, but as the house had none he bought a guitar admitting he knew almost nothing about chords My father had a violin and I had learned to play pizzicato on it, so when I got the guitar I played tunes on the strings, and John did the same . Michael Fishwick also lodged there from October 1951 until December 1958 , as did Keith Capron September 1956 to July 1959 . Both Capron and Cavill were studying veterinary science at the University of Liverpool, with Fishwick studying biochemistry. Three years after Smith's death, John's mother was killed on Menlove Avenue when, shortly after a visit to Mendips she was knocked down by a car driven by a drunk, off duty police officer, PC Eric Clague. Smith did not witness the accident, but shortly after was seen crying hysterically over Julia's body until the ambulance arrived. Clague was acquitted of all charges, given a reprimand, and a short suspension from duty. When Smith heard the verdict, she shouted Murderer at Clague. After John Lennon became famous, Smith berated him for speaking in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied That's showbusiness, they want me to speak more Liverpool . Despite the talk of Lennon being working class as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr he later refuted the idea, saying, I was a nice clean cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that . Although Smith later claimed that she had bought John's first guitar, it was actually his mother who did so, after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks. Julia insisted that the 5 instrument equivalent to 100 in 2019 had to be delivered to her house and not to her sister's. The two sisters first saw John perform with the Quarrymen at the Woolton St. Peter's Church fete on the afternoon of 6 July 1957. Julia who knew that her son would be performing heard music coming from the field behind the church now the site of the Bishop Martin School , and pulled Smith along with her to listen. John saw his aunt coming through the crowd and comically changed the words of a song to feature her name Oh oh, here comes Mimi down the aisle now... Smith related two versions of what she thought that day after seeing him on stage I was horrified to behold John in front of a microphone , and as pleased as Punch to see him up there . With help from Smith and John's headmaster, Lennon was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art because his aunt insisted that he should have some sort of academic qualifications, even though he was beginning to show an interest in music. She opposed the idea of John forming a band and disapproved of Paul McCartney because he was working class , calling him John's little friend . When she later met George Harrison, she hated him because of his thick Liverpudlian accent and Teddy Boy clothes. John and Paul often met at Mendips to write songs, and rehearsed in the glass panelled porch at the front of the house, which was the only place where they were allowed to play. Mimi once asked Parkes to take her to The Cavern to see John and the Beatles play, but when she descended into the damp, dark cellar full of screaming teenagers, she shouted to Parkes, Get him out, get him out Tell him to come off the stage He can't stay here.... We'll have to stop this The band's first residency in Hamburg exasperated her because she wanted Lennon to continue his studies, but he placated her by greatly exaggerating the sum of money he would earn. She hoped Lennon would become bored with music often saying, The guitar's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it . In later years, Lennon would jokingly remind her of the comment, and later had a silver plaque made engraved with her words. When later asked about the plaque, she would say that Lennon had it made for her husband, and not her. Smith's attitude to John's partners was often frosty, disdainful or sarcastic and she constantly criticised him about his relationships. She once referred to Cynthia, who became Lennon's first wife, as a gangster's moll , and was particularly unpleasant or cold towards her. In summer 1962, Cynthia discovered that she was pregnant with Lennon's child, so he proposed marriage. When he told his aunt, she threatened never to speak to him again to stop him from going through with it. Nevertheless, John and Cynthia were married on 23 August, at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool, although Smith did not attend. Lennon had wanted his half sisters, cousins and aunts to be there, but Smith had contacted them beforehand and advised them against attending. After the Lennons had been living at Brian Epstein's flat for a few months and after hearing about Cynthia's near miscarriage , Mimi offered to rent her downstairs back room to them. Before Christmas 1972, Smith met the then divorced Cynthia at the funeral of Smith's sister, Harriet, in Liverpool. Smith sternly criticised Cynthia for divorcing Lennon and letting him start a relationship with Yoko Ono by saying she should have stopped him from making an idiot of himself . Even though Smith was described as domineering, Ono later compared herself to her when describing her own relationship with Lennon. Smith later admitted that Ono was a good wife and mother. After Lennon's death, Ono and Sean Lennon visited Smith in Liverpool, where she was staying at her sister Anne's house because of a heart condition. She said, Sean is like John in every way looks and manner and he has got John's sense of humour. As long as he keeps away from music, he will be all right . Ono later bought 'Mendips' and donated it to The National Trust. It was renovated to make it look as it was in the 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there. Smith had relatives in Eketahuna, New Zealand, because her maternal aunt, Harriet Millward, had married and moved there. Smith had exchanged letters with her relatives over the years, so Lennon arranged for a tour of New Zealand in 1964. The success of the Beatles caused problems for her and she was constantly pestered by fans at 'Mendips', so she sold the house for 6,000 in 1965 equivalent to 114,100 in 2019 Lennon bought her a 25,000 bungalow equivalent to 475,500 in 2019 by the beach called Harbour's Edge in Sandbanks, at 126 Panorama Road, Poole, Dorset, which was her home for the rest of her life. The Lennons and their son visited her there in the summer of 1965, which was the last time all three of them visited the house together. Lennon later gave his aunt his MBE medal, but later asked for it back so that he could return it in protest. Lennon gave Smith an allowance of 30 per week equivalent to 700 in 2019 , but when she found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, What has she Cynthia's mother done to deserve anything Tell John, when you speak to him, that I am very, very annoyed , before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Smith was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time. Smith died on 6 December 1991, at the age of 85, while being cared for at home by Lynne Varcoe, an auxiliary nurse. During the night, other carers were present. On the day of her death, Smith collapsed in the bathroom, so Varcoe helped her to her bed, where Smith started Cheyne Stoking. According to Varcoe, her last words were, Hello, John . Although the oldest of the Stanley girls, Smith was the last to die. Cynthia, Sean and Ono attended her funeral on 12 December 1991 McCartney, Harrison and Starr all sent floral arrangements. Despite the animosity between Cynthia and Smith, Varcoe remembered Cynthia crying throughout the whole funeral, and said that Smith had always spoken positively about her. Smith was cremated at the Poole Crematorium and the reception was at the Harbour Heights Hotel. The whereabouts of her ashes is unknown. Ono put Smith's house up for sale on the same day as the cremation, but it was demolished in 1994, so a four bedroomed house could be built on the site. Smith was portrayed on film in Birth of The Beatles 1979 , John and Yoko A Love Story 1985 , In His Life The John Lennon Story 2000 , and by actress Kristin Scott Thomas in Nowhere Boy 2009 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimi%20Smith
"Patricia Lee Smith born December 30, 1946 is an American singer songwriter, musician, author, and poet who became an influential component of the New York City punk rock movement with her 1975 debut album Horses. Called the punk poet laureate, Smith fused rock and poetry in her work. Her most widely known song is Because the Night, which was co written with Bruce Springsteen. It reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978 and number five in the U.K. In 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On November 17, 2010, Smith won the National Book Award for her memoir Just Kids. The book fulfilled a promise she had made to her former long time roommate and partner, Robert Mapplethorpe. She placed 47th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Artists published in December 2010 and was also a recipient of the 2011 Polar Music Prize. Patricia Lee Smith was born in Chicago to Beverly Smith, a jazz singer turned waitress, and Grant Smith, who worked as a machinist at a Honeywell plant. The family was of part Irish ancestry and Patti was the eldest of four children. At the age of 4, Smith's family moved from Chicago to Germantown, Philadelphia, before heading to Pitman, New Jersey and later to The Woodbury Gardens section of Deptford Township, New Jersey. At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including Shrimp Boats by Harry Belafonte, Patience and Prudence's The Money Tree, and Another Side of Bob Dylan, which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964 and went to work in a factory. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on April 26, 1967, and chose to place her for adoption. In 1967, she left Glassboro State College now Rowan University and moved to Manhattan. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a bookstore with friend and poet Janet Hamill. She and Mapplethorpe had an intense romantic relationship, which was tumultuous as the pair struggled with times of poverty, and Mapplethorpe with his own sexuality. Smith considers Mapplethorpe to be one of the most important people in her life, and in her book Just Kids refers to him as the artist of my life. Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group albums, and they remained lifelong friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989. Her book and album The Coral Sea would be an homage to the life of Mapplethorpe and Just Kids would tell the story of their relationship. She would also write essays for several of Mapplethorpe's books, starting from one, at his request, for his posthumous Flowers. She went to Paris with her sister in 1969, and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to Manhattan, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe they frequented Max's Kansas City and CBGB. Smith provided the spoken word soundtrack for Sandy Daley's art film Robert Having His Nipple Pierced, starring Mapplethorpe. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play Femme Fatale. Afterward, she also starred in Tony Ingrassia's play Island. As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed for one night only in Cowboy Mouth, a play that she co wrote with Sam Shepard. The published play's notes call for a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow . She wrote several poems, for sam shepard and Sam Shepard 9 Random Years 7 2 about her relationship with Shepard. Smith was briefly considered for the lead singer position in Blue Oyster Cult. She contributed lyrics to several of the band's songs, including Debbie Denise inspired by her poem In Remembrance of Debbie Denise , Baby Ice Dog , Career of Evil , Fire of Unknown Origin , The Revenge of Vera Gemini on which she performs duet vocals , and Shooting Shark . She was romantically involved at the time with the band's keyboardist, Allen Lanier. During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism pieces, some of which were published in Rolling Stone and Creem. By 1974, Patti Smith was performing rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later with a full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who had moved to the United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, he decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, Hey Joe Piss Factory , in 1974. The A side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women ... . A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend. Later that same year, she performed spoken poetry on I Wake Up Screaming from Ray Manzarek's The Whole Thing Started with Rock Roll Now It's Out of Control album. The Patti Smith Group was signed by Clive Davis of Arista Records, and in 1975 recorded their first album, Horses, produced by John Cale amid some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's Gloria , and Smith's opening words Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine an excerpt from Oath , one of her early poems . The austere cover photograph by Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images. As the popularity of punk rock grew, Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe. The rawer sound of the group's second album, Radio Ethiopia, reflected this. Considerably less accessible than Horses, Radio Ethiopia initially received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert. She has said that Radio Ethiopia was influenced by the band MC5. On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of Radio Ethiopia, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida, and fell 15 feet into a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several neck vertebrae. The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of physical therapy, during which time she was able to reassess, re energize and reorganize her life. Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. Easter 1978 was her most commercially successful record, containing the single Because the Night co written with Bruce Springsteen. Wave 1979 was less successful, although the songs Frederick and Dancing Barefoot both received commercial airplay. Before the release of Wave, Smith, now separated from long time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred Sonic Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry as much as she did. Wave's Dancing Barefoot inspired by Jeanne Hebuterne and her tragic love for Amedeo Modigliani and Frederick were both dedicated to him. The running joke at the time was that she married Fred only because she would not have to change her name. They had a son, Jackson b. 1982 who would go on to marry The White Stripes drummer, Meg White in 2009 and a daughter, Jesse b. 1987 . Through most of the 1980s Smith was in semi retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. In June 1988, she released the album Dream of Life, which included the song People Have the Power . Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994, of a heart attack. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd. When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg whom she had known since her early years in New York urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe . In 1996, Smith worked with her long time colleagues to record Gone Again, featuring About a Boy , a tribute to Kurt Cobain. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on E Bow the Letter , a song on R.E.M.'s New Adventures in Hi Fi, which she has also performed live with the band. After the release of Gone Again, Patti Smith recorded two new albums Peace and Noise in 1997 with the single 1959 , about the invasion of Tibet and Gung Ho in 2000 with songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father . Songs 1959 and Glitter in Their Eyes were nominated for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. A box set of her work up to that time, The Patti Smith Masters, came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of Land 19752002 , a two CD compilation that includes a cover of Prince's When Doves Cry . Smith's solo art exhibition Strange Messenger was hosted at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002. On April 27, 2004, Patti Smith released Trampin' which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother, who had died two years before. It was her first album on Columbia Records, soon to become a sister label to her previous home Arista Records. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of Horses in its entirety. Guitarist Tom Verlaine took Oliver Ray's place. This live performance was released later in the year as Horses Horses. On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In addition to Smith's influence on rock music, the Minister also noted her appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. In August 2005, Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at the CBGB nightclub, with a 312 hour tour de force to close out Manhattan's music venue. She took the stage at 9 30 p.m. EDT and closed for the night and forever for the venue at a few minutes after 1 00 am, performing her song Elegie , and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years. Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and gave a performance of The Rolling Stones staple Gimme Shelter . As the closing number of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's People Have the Power was used for the big celebrity jam that always ends the program. From November 2006 to January 2007, an exhibition called 'Sur les Traces' at Trolley Gallery, London, featured polaroid prints taken by Patti Smith and donated to Trolley to raise awareness and funds for the publication of Double Blind, a book on the war in Lebanon in 2006, with photographs by Paolo Pellegrin, a member of Magnum Photos. She also participated in the DVD commentary for Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters. From March 28 to June 22, 2008, the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain in Paris hosted a major exhibition of the visual artwork of Patti Smith, Land 250, drawn from pieces created between 1967 and 2007. At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture. Smith is the subject of a 2008 documentary film by Steven Sebring titled Patti Smith Dream of Life. A live album by Patti Smith and Kevin Shields, The Coral Sea was released in July 2008. On September 10, 2009, after a week of smaller events and exhibitions in the city, Smith played an open air concert in Florence's Piazza Santa Croce, commemorating her performance in the same city 30 years earlier. In the meantime, she contributed with a special introduction to Jessica Lange's book 50 Photographs 2009 . Smith's book, Just Kids, a memoir of her time in 1970s Manhattan and her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, was published in 2010 it later won the National Book Award for Nonfiction. In 2018 a new edition with many added photographs and illustrations was published. She also headlined a benefit concert headed by bandmate Tony Shanahan, for The Court Tavern of New Brunswick. Smith's set included Gloria , Because the Night and People Have the Power. She has a brief cameo in Jean Luc Godard's 2010 Film Socialisme, which was first screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. In 2010 Patti Smith received an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute, along with architect Daniel Libeskind, MoMA director Glenn Lowry, former NYC Landmarks Commissioner Barbaralee Diamonstein Spielvogel, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and director Steven Soderbergh. Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and sang played two songs accompanied by long time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 when she moved to New York City Brooklyn , she would never have been accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends including Mapplethorpe were students at Pratt and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she learned much of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later. Patti Smith was one of the winners of the 2011 Polar Music Prize. She made her television acting debut at the age of 64 on the TV series Law Order Criminal Intent, appearing in an episode called Icarus . In 2011 Smith was working on a crime novel set in London. I've been working on a detective story that starts at the St Giles in the Fields church in London for the last two years , she told NME adding that she loved detective stories having been a fan of British fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and U.S. crime author Mickey Spillane as a girl. Part of the book will be set in Gothenburg, Sweden. Following the death of her husband in 1994, Smith began devoting time to what she terms pure photography a method of capturing still objects without using a flash . In 2011, Smith announced the first museum exhibition of her photography in the United States, Camera Solo. She named the project after a sign she saw in the abode of Pope Celestine V, which translates as a room of one's own , and which Smith felt best described her solitary method of photography. The exhibition featured artifacts which were the everyday items or places of significance of artists whom Smith admires, including Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Keats and Blake. In February 2012, she was a guest at the Sanremo Music Festival. Smith recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's classic Words of Love for the CD Rave on Buddy Holly, a tribute album tied to Holly's seventy fifth birthday year which was released June 28, 2011. She also recorded the song Capitol Letter for the official soundtrack of the second film of the Hunger Games series The Hunger Games Catching Fire. Smith's 11th studio album, Banga, was released in June 2012. Music Journalist Hal Horowitz wrote These songs aren't as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as she moans, chants, speaks and spits out lyrics with the grace and determination of Mohammad Ali in his prime. It's not an easy listenthe vast majority of her music never has beenbut if you're a fan and or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty. The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating universal acclaim . Also in 2012 Patti Smith recorded the cover of Io come persona by the Italian singer songwriter Giorgio Gaber, translated into English I as a person , contained in the anthological album ...io ci sono. In 2015, Adult Swim offered Smith the opportunity to perform a song to commemorate the series finale of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Smith, an avowed fan of the series, recorded the song Aqua Teen Dream with the help of her children and band. The vocal track was recorded in a hotel overlooking Lerici's Bay of Poets. On September 26, 2015, Smith performed during the American Museum of Tort Law convocation ceremony.

After the official presentation speech for the literary prize by Horace Engdahl, a member of the Swedish Academy, Smith sang the Dylan song A Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall . Possibly overcome by nerves she sang I saw the babe that was just bleedin , the wrong words to the second verse and became unable to continue. She stopped, and after a brief apology, resumed the song, which earned her a jubilant applause at the end. In 2017, Smith appeared as herself in Song to Song directed by Terrence Malick, opposite Rooney Mara and Ryan Gosling. She later made an appearance at the Detroit show of U2's The Joshua Tree 2017 tour and performed Mothers of the Disappeared with the band.

In 2019, Smith performed her anthem People Have the Power with Stewart Copeland and Choir Choir Choir at Onassis Festival 2019 Democracy Is Coming, co presented by The Public Theatre and Onassis USA. Smith has been a great source of inspiration for Michael Stipe of R.E.M. Listening to her album Horses when he was 15 made a huge impact on him he said later, I decided then that I was going to start a band. In 1998, Stipe published a collection of photos called Two Times Intro On the Road with Patti Smith. Stipe sings backing vocals on Smith's songs Last Call and Glitter in Their Eyes. Smith sang background vocals on R.E.M.'s songs E Bow the Letter and Blue . The Australian alternative rock band, The Go Betweens dedicated a track When She Sang About Angels off their 2000 album, The Friends of Rachel Worth, to Smith's long time influence. In 2004, Shirley Manson of Garbage spoke of Smith's influence on her in Rolling Stone's issue The Immortals 100 Greatest Artists of All Time , in which Patti Smith was counted number 47.

In 2004, Sonic Youth released an album called Hidros 3 to Patti Smith . U2 also cites Patti Smith as an influence. In 2005 Scottish singer songwriter KT Tunstall released the single Suddenly I See as a tribute of sorts to Patti Smith. Canadian actress Ellen Page frequently mentions Smith as one of her idols and has done various photo shoots replicating famous Smith photos, as well as Irish actress Maria Doyle Kennedy who often refers to Smith as a major influence. In 1978 and 1979, Gilda Radner portrayed a character called Candy Slice on Saturday Night Live based on Smith. Alternative rock singer songwriter Courtney Love of Hole heavily credited Smith as being a huge influence on her Love received Smith's album Horses in juvenile hall as a teenager, and realized that you could do something that was completely subversive that didn't involve violence felonies. I stopped making trouble, said Love. I stopped. Hole's classic track Violet features the lyrics And the sky was all violet I want it again, but violent, more violent , alluding to lyrics from Smith's Kimberly . Love later stated that she considered Rock n Roll Nigger the greatest rock song of all time. American pop singer Madonna has also named Smith as one of her biggest influences. Anglo Celtic rock band The Waterboys' debut single, A Girl Called Johnny , was written as a tribute to Smith. In 2018, the English band Florence and the Machine dedicated Smith the High as Hope album song Patricia . The lyrics reference Patricia as Florence Welch's North Star . In 1993, Smith contributed Memorial Tribute Live to the AIDS Benefit Album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization. Smith was a supporter of the Green Party and backed Ralph Nader in the 2000 United States presidential election. She led the crowd singing Over the Rainbow and People Have the Power at the campaign's rallies, and also performed at several of Nader's subsequent Democracy Rising events. Smith was a speaker and singer at the first protests against the Iraq War as U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. Smith supported Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 election. Bruce Springsteen continued performing her People Have the Power at Vote for Change campaign events. In the winter of 2004 2005, Smith toured again with Nader in a series of rallies against the Iraq War and called for the impeachment of George W. Bush. Smith premiered two new protest songs in London in September 2006. Louise Jury, writing in The Independent, characterized them as an emotional indictment of American and Israeli foreign policy . The song Qana was about the Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese village of Qana. Without Chains is about Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen who was born and raised in Germany, held at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp for four years. Jury's article quotes Smith as saying I wrote both these songs directly in response to events that I felt outraged about. These are injustices against children and the young men and women who are being incarcerated. I'm an American, I pay taxes in my name and they are giving millions and millions of dollars to a country such as Israel and cluster bombs and defense technology and those bombs were dropped on common citizens in Qana. It's terrible. It's a human rights violation. In an interview, Smith stated that Kurnaz's family has contacted her and that she wrote a short preface for the book that he was writing. Kurnaz's book, Five Years of My Life, was published in English by Palgrave Macmillan in March 2008, with Patti's introduction. On March 26, 2003, ten days after Rachel Corrie's death, Smith appeared in Austin, Texas, and performed an anti war concert. She subsequently wrote a song Peaceable Kingdom which was inspired by and is dedicated to Rachel Corrie. In 2009, in her Meltdown concert in Festival Hall, she paid homage to the Iranians taking part in post election protests by saying Where is My Vote in a version of the song People Have the Power . In 2015, Smith appeared with Ralph Nader, spoke and performed the songs Wing and People Have the Power during the American Museum of Tort Law convocation ceremony in Winsted, Connecticut. She performed Wing again in 2016 in homage to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks during the First they came for Assange ... event at Centre Pompidou, Paris, France, to mark the 4th year of Julian Assange's attempt to avoid prosecution by taking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Smith spoke, read poetry, and performed several songs accompanied by her daughter Jesse at Ralph Nader's Breaking Through Power conference at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. A long time supporter of Tibet House US, she performs yearly at their benefit at Carnegie Hall. Smith was raised a Jehovah's Witness and had a strong religious upbringing and a Bible education. She left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining. In response to this experience, she wrote the line Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine in her cover version of Gloria by Them. She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of eleven or twelve, saying I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer, but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has come to the conclusion that religious dogmas are ... man made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not. In 2014, Smith offered her opinion on the sexualization of women in music. Pop music has always been about the mainstream and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge. As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism I have a son and a daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, but I have a son tooI believe in human rights. In 2015, writer Anwen Crawford observed that Smith's attitude to genius seems pre feminist, if not anti feminist there is no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work.

"Philip Marc Smith born 10 July 1965 in Willenhall, West Midlands, England is an English spree killer serving a life sentence for the murders of three women in Birmingham. A former fairground worker employed at the Rainbow pub in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four day period in November 2000, befriending two of them at the Rainbow before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming evidence linking him to the deaths. Smith's first victim was Jodie Hyde, a recovering butane gas addict whom he met at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He is thought to have strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother of three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out. Smith was apprehended after he contacted West Midlands Police saying that he wished to make a statement about Corcoran's disappearance. At the time, however, her body had not been positively identified, and inquiries quickly established that some aspects of his account were false. The murder inquiry, named Operation Green, uncovered a large quantity of strong evidence incriminating Smith, but at first he denied responsibility. He maintained his innocence as his trial began in July 2001, but later in the proceedings changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The motive for his crimes was unclear, but police who arrested him believed that a lack of permanent sexual relations was a contributing factor. Detectives also investigated the death of a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined. Philip John Smith was born in 1965 at the City Maternity Hospital in Gloucester, where he grew up. The son of sawmill labourer Henry John Smith and his wife Rose Smith nee Luckins , he was the oldest of five siblings. Smith's family lived in Midland Road, where they were neighbours of serial killers Fred and Rosemary West, before moving to Hailes Road on the Coney Hill Estate in 1971. The family had a modest income, and their situation became worse when Smith's father was injured in a motoring accident. Smith attended Coney Hill Infants and Junior School and later went to a special school for children with learning difficulties. He left school at 14 to join Billy Danter's Funfair, which toured extensively throughout the United Kingdom and also employed his father. He worked out of season as a farmhand, labourer and security guard. Smith moved from Gloucester to Tewkesbury and then Ross on Wye, where he lived with a female partner. They had a son in 1990 and two more children in 1992, but Smith left the family and moved to Cardiff when the relationship became difficult. He then spent a year in Ireland lodging with a travelling family who took pity on him while he was hitchhiking in Athlone, County Westmeath. He told them he was an English gypsy visiting Ireland, and they allowed him to live rent free in a spare caravan, while he contributed a portion of his unemployment benefit towards food. This family asked Smith to leave when they became uncomfortable about sexual remarks he had made to young female members of the family. Smith moved to Birmingham towards the end of 1999 and stayed briefly at the Trinity Centre, a hostel for the homeless in Digbeth, before moving to a property managed by a housing association in Braithwaite Road in the Sparkbrook district of Birmingham. He became well known locally and was a regular patron of the Shamrock Cafe on Stratford Road and of the Rainbow pub in Digbeth, where he was employed on a casual basis as an odd jobber and served as an unofficial taxi driver for drinkers. Smith received over 30 criminal convictions for minor offences, beginning in May 1984 when he was fined 100 for theft. His record also included handling stolen goods, burglary and driving without a licence, but no violence. At 6 ft 4 in and weighing 22 stone, with a dishevelled appearance and a soft West Country accent, he was considered gentle by those he met. In an interview with the Birmingham Evening Mail following Smith's trial in July 2001, Jim Smith, proprietor of the Shamrock Cafe, said, He was a gentle giant who we named 'Bigfoot' because his boots always used to leave black marks on the floor. Ninety nine per cent of the time he had a dirty appearance and looked like he had been working on a car. On 8 November 2000, Smith met 21 year old Jodie Hyde, a recovering butane gas addict from Alum Rock, Birmingham, at the Rainbow pub, and they were seen leaving together. He took her to a hospital appointment and later killed her. Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook, where he set it alight. The still smouldering remains were discovered at 6 15 am next morning 9 November by two patrolling police officers. The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints. A subsequent post mortem concluded that she had been strangled before being rolled up in a carpet and set on fire. Three days later, Smith met Rosemary Corcoran, a 25 year old mother of three from Castle Vale at the same pub, and again they were seen leaving together. He drove her to Worcestershire before bludgeoning her to death and running over her body near Droitwich Spa. She was found at 8 30 am on 12 November by a man walking his dog in a lane near Junction 5 of the M5 motorway. Smith's third victim was Carol Jordan, a 39 year old care home worker and mother of six from Balsall Heath, who was killed as she walked to work. Smith hit her from behind with his car while driving back from Worcestershire, fracturing her hip. Fearing that he would be caught, Smith moved her to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse. The body was discovered at 8 50 am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road, Lee Bank. When staff at the Rainbow pub told Smith of Corcoran's disappearance on 13 November, he telephoned the police station at Castle Vale saying that he wished to give a statement. Significantly, his call came at 4 00 pm, before the body found in Worcestershire had been positively identified as Corcoran's, and within an hour Smith had presented himself at Castle Vale. Detective Constable Ruth Wilkins later recalled Smith's phone call He said he would like to come to the police station to help with the inquiry and that he had seen on Saturday night leave the pub with an unknown man. He insisted he would like to come over to the police station. He said he had been asked to contact the police by someone else and gave his mobile number. In his subsequent statement Smith admitted to being at the Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated when they went to another pub, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her. The murder investigation, named Operation Green, was led by Sir Edward Crewe, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, and included 100 police officers and 50 support staff from the West Midlands and West Mercia forces. Detectives viewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage, gathered more than 100 separate exhibits and interviewed witnesses. Evidence was analysed by scientists from the Forensic Science Service FSS in Birmingham. Martin Whittaker, the scientist who headed the FSS team, spoke of the huge volume of evidence The team pulled together every strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of 'spider's web' and in the centre of it all ... was Philip Smith. In 20 years of working for the FSS, I have never had to deal with so much evidence in relation to one suspect. It was quite overwhelming. Although Smith maintained his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death and those of the other two women. Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later footage showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury. In addition to the witnesses and CCTV footage, there was substantial forensic evidence linking Smith to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing at the time of his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot. Smith was charged with Corcoran's murder on 17 November 2000 and remanded in custody the following day. By this time her death had been linked to the killing of Hyde. Police interviewed Smith in connection with the deaths of Hyde and Jordan on 28 November and charged him with their murders two days later. While awaiting trial, Smith was held as a Category A prisoner in the high security Woodhill Prison in Buckinghamshire. Smith's trial began at Leicester Crown Court on 3 July 2001, where he pleaded not guilty to the three murder charges. The case was prosecuted by Tim Raggatt, QC, and Smith was defended by Rachel Brand, QC. On the opening day of the trial, Raggatt told the Court there was powerful and compelling scientific evidence linking Smith to the killings. Smith's defence was that traces of blood found on his clothes were there because police had tampered with evidence, while the trousers belonging to Rosemary Corcoran found at his flat had been among a bag of clothes Smith had stolen from outside an Oxfam shop. On 17 July Smith complained of feeling unwell with chest and eye pain while under cross examination, and proceedings were briefly halted while he was treated for the symptoms of a panic attack. When Smith returned to the witness stand, he said he wished to speak to his barrister. Presiding judge Rafferty told him that he must answer questions, to which Smith replied I want to change my plea. I'm fed up with this. I want to change my plea. The charges were read to him again the following day, and he pleaded guilty. On 18 July 2001 Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment. In January 2005, Birmingham's Sunday Mercury newspaper reported that Smith had decided to change his plea after police agreed to return 400 confiscated from him during a raid on his flat after his arrest, and that he wanted the money to buy Mars bars in prison. Passing sentence, Rafferty said You robbed three innocent ladies of their lives. I suspect that their families will suffer the more as they simply don't understand why you did. The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness with which you dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like a man at the overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial. The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a lack of permanent sexual relations had been a contributing factor. As a result of their inquiries into Smith's background, police launched an investigation into the death of a fourth woman who was discovered to have had links to him. Patricia Lynott, a 47 year old divorced mother of two, had moved to Birmingham from Athlone during the mid 1990s. On 23 October 2000, while she was employed at the Rainbow pub as a cleaner and to look after the licensee's children, she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat on Maxstoke Street, Bordesley Green. Police believed at first that she had died of natural causes. A post mortem failed to establish a cause of death, and her body was returned to Ireland for burial. Because Lynott had worked alongside Smith at the Rainbow, West Midlands Police wished to re examine the cause of her death. In early 2001, investigators asked the Irish authorities for a new post mortem, and on 8 March Lynott's body was exhumed by Gardai from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to the city morgue in Dublin for further examination by Ireland's State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison. However, the results of this autopsy also proved inconclusive. An inquest into Lynott's death was held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found on her back and an arm may have been bruising, but the pathologist who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The coroner's jury returned an open verdict. Police also conducted a routine re examination of other unsolved murder cases dating back 20 years in areas where Smith had lived. Officers from West Midlands Police held a conference in October 2001 with representatives from several other forces, including West Mercia and Gloucestershire, to share information about unsolved murder cases in their areas. Detectives interviewed Smith three times, but he refused to answer their questions, and no further charges were brought.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip%20Smith%20%28criminal%29

After his wife became an actress in features at Universal Studios in 1921, Smith directed her in multiple comedies. Lahue and Gill characterize these films as, some of Universal's most memorable comedies of the twenties , and note, Starting with the usual framework provided by the situation comedy format, directors William Watson and Richard Smith inserted a sufficient amount of subdued slapstick to flavor these single reels with laugh after laugh.

I've sort of moved things a little bit across to leg stump and now I'm going just outside off stump . Smith remarked Everything sort of just clicked into place and it felt really good so I've continued doing it . In the fourth Test he was dismissed at 19 by Stuart Broad but later on made another century in the final Test at the SCG, alongside with the partnership with Brad Haddin, helping Australia come back from 597 to 326 all out in the first innings and went on to win the Test match by 281 runs.

The legality of the catch continued to be the main talking point after the ODI Series and afterwards ICC made a press statement stating that As long as the movement of a close catching fielder is in response to the strikers actions the shot he she is about to play or shaping to play , then movement is permitted before the ball reaches the striker.

Footage emerged showing Warner having to be physically restrained after words were spoken between the two. This led to Smith and opposing captain Faf du Plessis being called to a meeting with umpires and match officials, where they were reminded of their responsibility to control their teams. South Africa won the second Test by 6 wickets, with Smith's contributions being only 25 and 11 runs. Smith's diminishing returns with the bat and lower than average strike rate suggested that he may have been struggling somewhat. During the match South African fast bowler and player of the match Kagiso Rabada was suspended for the following Test after he made physical contact with Smith after he dismissed him. Rabada successfully appealed the ban a decision that annoyed Smith. Australia were beaten by 322 runs in the third Test, with Smith barely contributing to the score. However, the match result was overshadowed by illegal ball tampering that occurred on the third day. Cameron Bancroft, the second youngest and most inexperienced member of the team, was captured by television cameras surreptitiously using sandpaper to rough up the cricket ball. He then hid the sandpaper in his underwear before being confronted by the on field umpires. When attending the press conference at the conclusion of the third day's play with Bancroft, Smith admitted that the leadership group of the team discussed tampering with the ball to influence the result of the match during the lunch break. He admitted that he was part of the leadership group but did not identify the other members. Smith and vice captain David Warner stood down from the team leadership the morning after the incident, but still played on, and wicketkeeper Tim Paine took over as interim captain for the rest of the Test match. Subsequently, match referee Andy Pycroft for the ICC banned Smith for one Test match and fined him 100 of his match fee. He handed Bancroft three demerit points and fined him 75 of his match fee. Cricket Australia launched an independent investigation, charging Smith with bringing the game into disrepute. He was suspended and sent home from the tour. The report stated that, while he did not develop the plan, Smith was found to have misled match officials and others, and as captain did not act to prevent it. He was therefore banned from all international and domestic cricket for 12 months starting from 29 March 2018. He was also debarred from consideration for any team leadership role for an additional 12 months. Warner and Bancroft also received bans. Smith also had his contract with the Rajasthan Royals IPL team for the 2018 season terminated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India as a consequence of the sanctions. Smith arrived in Sydney on 29 March. In a press conference at Sydney Airport, a tearful Smith started by saying that he had nothing to add to Cricket Australia's report. He said that as captain of the Australian cricket team, he took full responsibility even though he did not devise the plan to change the condition of the ball or actually perform the act , and that he had made a serious error in judgement It was a failure of leadership, my leadership. As well as apologising to his teammates, to fans of cricket all over the world and to all Australians who are disappointed and angry , he specifically referred to the effect that the incident had had on his parents and implored others faced with questionable decisions to consider their parents. He added, I know I will regret this for the rest of my life. I'm absolutely gutted. I hope in time I can earn back respect and forgiveness. In April 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. After missing 201819 season, Smith was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 201920 season. On 1 June 2019, Smith played in Australia's opening match of the Cricket World Cup, against Afghanistan, at the County Ground in Bristol. On 11 July 2019, in the semi final match against England Smith scored 85 runs, becoming the second batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to score four 50 scores in the Cricket World Cup knockouts. In the tournament, he scored 379 runs at an average of 37.90, including four fifties. In July 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes series in England. In the first Test at Edgbaston, Smith scored centuries in both innings, his ninth and tenth Ashes centuries and his 24th and 25th overall. His 25th came in his 119th innings, second only to Don Bradman who took 69 innings . In the first innings of the second Test, his innings was interrupted on 80, when he was hit by a 148.7 km h ball on the left side of his neck, under the ear. He later returned to complete his innings after passing the concussion tests and was out, lbw, for 92. On 18 August 2019, the final day of the Test, Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne, after further tests showed he had actually suffered concussion due to the blow the previous day. Therefore, Labuschagne became the first player to become a concussion substitute in a Test match following a change in the International Cricket Council's ICC rules. The concussion then ruled him out of the third Test, though this did not stop him reclaiming the number one position in the Test batting rankings on 3 September 2019. In the first innings of the fourth Test at Old Trafford Smith scored his third double century in Test matches and third century in the series and became the first batsman to score 500 or more runs in three successive Ashes series. Smith registered his tenth consecutive Ashes fifty plus score in the first innings of the fifth Test, breaking Inzamam Ul Haq's record for the most consecutive Test 50 scores against a single opposition. He finished the series with 774 runs, by far the most on either side, winning him his second consecutive ComptonMiller Medal as the man of the series. Smith is a right handed batsman with a technique that has attracted attention for its unorthodoxy. He moves around frequently in the crease, especially during bowlers' run up, and ends up with the toes of his feet outside off stump against right handers, controls the bat with his bottom hand that is, the hand closest to the blade of the bat , and is capable of playing unconventional cricket shots like the reverse sweep. Playing in a club match in January 2010, right handed Smith took guard left handed and hit a six. Due to his unorthodox style, Smith was initially labelled as a limited overs batsman who might struggle in the longer form of the game, especially early in his career when he was vulnerable outside off stump. However, Smith compensates for his unique technique with outstanding hand eye co ordination, focus, and his footwork, especially to spin bowlers, is exemplary. Smith spontaneously experimented with his technique during the Perth Test match in the 201314 Ashes, during which he decided to take a prelim movement back and across to counter short pitched bowling. This change has taken his batting average from 33 to 63.55 as it stands as of 2018. At the time of delivery, Smith's stumps are fully covered, making bowled dismissals unlikely. This position also allows him to play to either the on or off side with ease. Much of the credit for Smith's success can also be attributed to batting coach Trent Woodhill, who coached Smith as a junior and noted his abundant talent. He has also defended Smith's unique batting style, and has long argued that in Australia, many naturally talented cricketers who may not necessarily have an orthodox technique are let down by over coaching in the years between leaving school and his elevation into international cricket, Smith had his technique picked apart by a number of well intentioned coaches. Since re establishing his working relationship with Woodhill, Smith appears to have regained calm and confidence in his cricket, which has since produced results over the last few seasons. Smith is also known for his concentration, being able to bat for long periods of time, even through a whole day's play. As a bowler, however, after his quick rise up the batting order until he became captain, and settled in at 4 , the comparisons to Shane Warne never gathered momentum. He was an able option as a leg spinner early in his career, but was under used because he was described as a very defensive bowler. In ODIs it becomes more apparent, as he will put himself on to bowl when others' economy rates are too high. He has already been tagged as the second Captain Grumpy since Allan Border early in his captaincy reign, having to warn Mitchell Starc for unsportsmanlike behaviour, and being highly critical of the team's bowling and fielding despite beating New Zealand by over 200 runs. Later, in 20172018, he publicly criticised Glenn Maxwell's training regimen when Maxwell was dropped from the Australian ODI squad. He has also been criticised for having too much influence over team selections. As of September 2019 , Smith has scored 26 Test and eight ODI centuries. As of April 2018, Smith has made a total of 37 first class centuries, ten List A centuries and one T20 century. His best bowling figures of 64 7 were taken for New South Wales against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Smith%20%28cricketer%29
"Thomas William Smith born 22 May 1980 is an English retired professional footballer who last played for Brentford. He is normally used as a right winger or a striker. Smith started his career at Watford, where his younger brother Jack was also a trainee. He played a part in Watford's consecutive promotions from the Second Division, reaching the Premier League in 1999. Although Watford were relegated in 2000, Smith represented his country at under 21 level the following season. He left Watford to join Sunderland on a free transfer in 2003, before moving to Derby County in 2004. He was voted Derby Player of the year in 2006, before re joining Watford. After the club's relegation in his first season back at Vicarage Road, Smith's subsequent performances earned him consecutive Watford Player of the Season awards in 200708 and 200809. At the start of the following season he was sold to Premier League club Portsmouth. The club faced administration that season, and were eventually relegated. The following season, Smith joined Championship club Queens Park Rangers, becoming a regular in a team challenging for promotion to the Premier League. Smith joined Brentford in the summer of 2014, spending one season there where he helped them to the Championship play offs. Smith was born in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. His father Dave, a chartered surveyor and former Watford youth team player, helped coach with the academy during his son's time there. His younger brother Jack, born in 1983, also came through the club's youth system to become a professional player. The pair did not play for Watford together competitively Tommy was substituted in the 67th minute of the club's 40 win over Brighton Hove Albion on 26 April 2003, while Jack would make his first team debut as an 81st minute substitute. Jack would not make another appearance that season, while Tommy left for Sunderland in the summer. Smith attended Hemel Hempstead school between 1991 and 1997. He has been with his wife Nina since leaving school. They married in 2005, live in Berkhamstead and have three children. Outside of football, Smith's interests include golf and films. In 2014, he and his brother Jack took over the sales arm of an estate agent and chartered surveyors with its headquarters in Bushey Heath, near Watford. As a boy Smith trained with Millwall, Sheffield United, who had a base in Amersham, and Watford, who he was with until the age of 12. After only playing for Comets Sports club in Sunday league football for two years, he was given a chance by his father at Watford in a county trial at the age of 14 and signed with them again. Manager Graham Taylor gave Smith his debut for Watford on 18 November 1997, bringing him on as a substitute in a 21 Second Division win over Oldham Athletic. Smith did not play another league game in 199798, but made eight appearances for Watford as they qualified for the play offs in the 199899 season, where the club gained promotion to the Premiership. He established himself in the team during the club's first Premier League season, making 23 appearances and scoring two goals, including one at Vicarage Road against Manchester United. Although Watford were relegated in 19992000, Smith remained at the club, playing under Gianluca Vialli and Ray Lewington, and scoring on his sole appearance for the England under 21 team in a 61 win against Georgia under 21. Watford finished in the bottom half of the First Division for three consecutive seasons, but individually Smith progressed in 200203 he finished as Watford's second highest goalscorer, with nine goals in all competitions. This included crucial goals in Watford's 2003 FA Cup run. His re taken penalty against Sunderland was the only goal of the fifth round tie, and he also scored the winning goal against Burnley in the quarter final, having recovered from a car crash. However he was dropped to the bench for Watford's 2003 FA Cup semi final with Southampton, with on loan striker Michael Chopra chosen instead. He later admitted that this had left him devastated . Smith chose to leave Watford at the end of the 200203 season. However, as he was under the age of 24, he was unable to leave without a fee being paid, and so Watford had to employ him on a monthly contract. He had a two week trial with Premier League side Charlton Athletic, who did not offer him a contract for financial reasons. He then went on trial with West Ham United, but Glenn Roeder was sacked as manager, and his replacement Alan Pardew chose not to sign him permanently. Smith then spent a week on trial with Italian side Perugia which he hated . On his return to England he started a trial with Sunderland, subsequently signing a contract in September 2003. Smith spent one season at Sunderland, helping them to finish third in the Championship, after which they lost 54 on penalties to Crystal Palace in the play off semi finals. For the second consecutive season Smith scored the winning goal in an FA Cup quarter final, and this time he was selected to play in the semi final, which Sunderland lost 10 to Millwall. Smith bought a house in the Sunderland area and anticipated discussing a two year contract at the end of the 200304 season. However, talks stalled and he chose to move to another Championship club, Derby County. Smith made his Derby debut in a league game against Leeds United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 20 victory over Queens Park Rangers. Derby reached the Championship play offs in Smith's first season at Pride Park. However, they were defeated 20 at Preston in the first leg of the semi finals. In the second leg, at Pride Park, Smith was substituted at half time. The game finished goalless, meaning that Preston progressed to the final. Smith came second in the voting for Player of the year behind Inigo Idiakez, but did win the inaugural Derbyshire Fair Play award. Derby's form deteriorated in 200506, with the club finishing 20th in the table, and eliminated early from both cup competitions. However, this time Smith became the club's Player of the year. At the end of the season, Billy Davies was appointed Derby manager charged with the task of turning the club around and Smith believed that Davies wanted to bring his own players in. He was close to signing for Sheffield United, before he was the subject of an approach from former club Watford, who had just won promotion to the Premier League. On 30 August 2006, Smith rejoined Watford for a fee of 500k, signing a four year contract. Smith scored his first league goal of his second spell at Watford on 26 December 2006, against Arsenal at Vicarage Road. However, this wasn't enough to prevent a 21 defeat. Watford reached the last four of the FA Cup in 2007, and in contrast to 2003, Smith was selected to start for Watford in the semi final. However, for the second time in his career Smith was on the losing side, this time 41 to Manchester United. At the end of the 200607 season Smith finished sixth in the voting for the club's Player of the Season awards, behind runaway winner Ben Foster. However, Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd named Smith as his outfield player of the season. After relegation from the Premier League, Smith had a successful season in the Championship, with seven goals and nine assists earning him the 2008 Watford Player of the Season award. One of his goals was the equaliser in a 11 draw against Blackpool on the last day of the regular season, which secured Watford's place in the 200708 Championship play offs. Smith played in both legs of the semi finals, where they were defeated 61 on aggregate by Hull City. One of his best seasons was the 200809 season, in which he scored seventeen league goals and made nine assists. As well as finishing as the club's top scorer, he was named Player of the Season for the second year running, as Watford finished 13th. Smith made his 300th appearance for Watford in the penultimate game of the season, a 32 win away to Coventry City. He started the 200910 season in similar form, and was involved in all of Watford's first seven league goals, scoring two and assisting the other five. This was despite ongoing transfer speculation linking Smith with Readingmanaged by former Watford manager Brendan Rodgersas well as other Premier League and Championship clubs, and Watford manager Malky Mackay confirming that the club was considering an offer for him. On 27 August 2009, it was confirmed that Smith had signed a four year deal with Premier League club Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of 1.8m. He later admitted that he was close to signing for Championship side Reading but chose Portsmouth instead. On 30 August 2009, Smith made his Portsmouth debut in a 10 defeat to Manchester City at Fratton Park. Portsmouth failed to pay their player's wages on time on three occasions in the 200910 season, and Smith was among a number of Portsmouth players linked with a transfer during the January 2010 transfer window. However, due to his five games for Watford, he would have been ineligible to play for another club during the 200910 season. Smith scored his first goal for Portsmouth against Hull City on 20 March 2010. He suffered a broken nose following Daniel Sturridge elbowing him in the face in the following game, and subsequently missed the FA Cup semi final. However, he recovered to play four further Premier League matches. Portsmouth were relegated in 20th position at the end of the season, having been deducted nine points for entering into administration. Despite uncertainty over whether the club would be able to continue as a business, Smith remained at the club. He started their first match of the 201011 season on 7 August 2010, a match in which Portsmouth were only able to name four of their permitted seven substitutes. On 31 August, Smith joined Queens Park Rangers on an initial three month loan deal. His move was made permanent in January 2011, with Smith having agreed a three year deal for a fee of around 1.5 million. Smith provided the assist for Heiar Helguson in a 21 win against Crystal Palace on 2 October and has since made many positive contributions to the QPR team but found starts hard to come by in the early days of his Rangers career. He scored his first goal for the club against Reading on 6 November, and also netted a late equaliser in a 11 draw with former club Portsmouth three days later, scoring a last minute penalty to earn QPR a point and keep their unbeaten start to the season intact. On 20 August 2011, he scored his and QPR's first goal of the 201112 Premier League season, in a 10 away win against Everton. On 23 August 2012, Smith signed a two year contract with Cardiff City for an estimated fee of 350,000. He was given the number 14 shirt, and made his debut two days later on 25 August 2012, in a 24 away defeat against Bristol City. On 23 October, Smith suffered a hamstring injury against Watford, which eventually meant that he missed the remainder of 2012. His first goal for Cardiff City came on his first start after returning from his injury on 19 January, and was the winning goal in a 21 victory at Blackpool. Smith received another Championship winner's medal as Cardiff won the division in April 2013, but was restricted to three cup appearances during Cardiff's first season in the Premier League. He was released after the Blues' relegation at the end of the 201314 season, having made 27 appearances and scored one goal during his two seasons with the club. On 15 July 2014, it was revealed that Smith was training with Championship side Brentford. On 7 August 2014, Smith signed a one year deal with Brentford. Smith scored an 86th minute equalizer on his Brentford debut against Charlton Athletic in a game that finished 11, on 9 August 2014. After his one year contract expired, Smith was released by Brentford and subsequently announced his retirement. Since retiring in 2015, Smith has appeared as a guest on Sky Sports' coverage of The Football League and on Channel 5's highlights show, Football League Tonight. As a young child Smith played as a central midfielder, before converting to a striker at age 12. He is a quick player capable of kicking the ball with his weaker left foot, and prefers being part of a team that plays passing football, than one that employs a more direct style. Upon signing him for Portsmouth, then manager Paul Hart said of Smith I've liked Tommy for a long time. He's clever, infectious, enthusiastic and a hard worker. He can play as a centre forward, behind the centre forward or out wide, so covers a lot of positions. He's going to be a great asset to us.

"James Torrey Smith born January 26, 1989 is a former American football wide receiver. He played college football at the University of Maryland and was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2011 NFL Draft. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, and Carolina Panthers. Smith is a two time Super Bowl champion, winning Super Bowl XLVII as a member of the Ravens and Super Bowl LII with the Eagles. Smith was born on January 26, 1989 and grew up with his mother Monica Jenkins in Colonial Beach, Virginia and Fredericksburg, Virginia. The oldest of seven children, Smith helped his single mother, who attended Rappahannock Community College in the day and worked at night, with household chores and earned honor roll grades in school. Smith attended Colonial Beach Elementary School until 3rd grade. Smith went on to Stafford Senior High School, where he played basketball as a guard, and football at several different positions. He enjoys fishing as a pastime. Smith played on the Stafford Indians football team as a quarterback, running back, wide receiver, cornerback, kickoff returner, and punt returner. In Stafford's 2004 game against King George, Smith opened with a 54 yard kickoff return, played quarterback, and scored on a 63 yard punt return. His coach, Roger Pierce, said, Torrey can do those type of things for us. We expect him to do those things. During his senior year in 2006, Smith had 155 carries for 815 yards and 12 touchdowns, completed nine of 25 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns, and made three receptions for 81 yards. Over the course of his interscholastic career, Smith returned six kickoffs for touchdowns. He earned all state kick returner honors as a sophomore, all district honors as a junior, and honorable mention All Northwest Region quarterback honors, all district, and all area honors as a senior. As a college prospect, Rivals.com ranked him 30th nationally among dual threat quarterbacks, Scouts, Inc. ranked him 33rd nationally among wide receivers, and SuperPrep placed him on its Virginia 33. ESPN assessed him as a do it all prospect and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5 second 40 yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not afraid to say it. I kind of want to show them that they questioned my speed and whether I was going to get it back. I want to show them that I'm all healed up. Virginia head coach Al Groh said of the Fredericksburg native before the 2009 game against Maryland, Clearly if we forsaw him being the type of player that he is now, he would be returning kicks for Virginia. So we are not above admitting that there is a player that certainly has turned out to be superior to what many people thought, including ourselves. He'sregardless of what the circumstances were in the pasthe is a superior college football player. Smith sat out the 2007 season at Maryland on redshirt status, and was voted the scout team player of the year as a freshman. He was named the scout team player of the week before the Florida State game. In summer camp, Smith adjusted from playing quarterback to wide receiver, a position he had limited experience with in high school. Teammate Darrius Heyward Bey said, He's like a sponge. He's taking it all in, asking a lot of questionsand that's good for a receiver. In December, he practiced with the first team after Isaiah Williams suffered an injury. Smith drew praise from the Maryland coaching staff during summer workouts before the 2008 season, and The Washington Times predicted Smith, alongside receiver Ronnie Tyler, would earn significant playing time. He played in all 13 games and started in the last six of the season. He also saw action on special teams as a kickoff returner. Smith recorded 24 receptions for 336 yards and two touchdowns. In its midseason report, The Baltimore Sun credited Smith for often giving an inconsistent Maryland team good field position with his long kick returns. Against Middle Tennessee, Smith returned four kicks for 86 yards. He made his first career reception for three yards the following week against 23 California. Against Eastern Michigan, Smith recorded two receptions for 58 yards and four kickoffs for 126 yards. Smith tallied his first collegiate touchdown on a third quarter reception from quarterback Chris Turner in the 2017 comeback at 20 Clemson. He recorded 144 return yards against Virginia. In the 260 victory over 21 Wake Forest, Smith returned the opening kick 34 yards, and caught two passes for eight yards. Smith made his career first start against NC State and recorded four kickoff returns for 85 yards, which set the school single season kickoff return yards record for a freshman, surpassing the 566 yard mark set by Da'Rel Scott in 2007. Smith blocked a punt against Virginia Tech, and led the team with 163 all purpose yards including 62 receiving yards. He recorded one reception for 12 yards against 16th ranked North Carolina. In the latter part of the season, Smith increased his role and was elevated over Isaiah Williams as the number two receiver across from Darrius Heyward Bey. Head coach Ralph Friedgen explained that his presence would alleviate the coverage on Heyward Bey and praised Smith's blocking ability in the running game. Against Florida State, Smith broke the school record for single season kickoff return yards, previously held by cornerback Josh Wilson. He had 119 all purpose yards, including one 13 yard reception. Smith posted his season best performance against 21st ranked Boston College with 245 all purpose yards and eight receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown. In the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl, he returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown against Nevada, which broke the bowl's previous return record of 98 yards. It was also the first time a Maryland player returned a kickoff for a touchdown in a bowl game. At the end of the season, Smith had returned 42 kickoffs for 1,089 yards, which set a new Atlantic Coast Conference single season record. Smith led the team with 1,425 all purpose yards, which put him ahead of starting running back Da'Rel Scott who compiled 1,304 yards. Before the 2009 season, Smith reportedly struggled in Maryland's summer camp, dividing his time between practice and online courses at night. Towards the end of camp, head coach Ralph Friedgen noted an improvement in his performance, which reestablished Smith as the team's top receiver alongside Adrian Cannon. During the season, Smith saw action in all twelve games, including ten as a starter, and he amassed 61 receptions for 824 receiving yards and five touchdowns, 51 kickoff returns for 1,309 yards and two touchdowns, and eleven rushing attempts for 59 yards and one touchdown. His kickoff return yardage surpassed the ACC single season record that he had set the previous year. Smith finished the season ranked sixth in the nation in all purpose yards. He was one of two players, alongside Donald Buckram of UTEP, to record more than 260 all purpose yards in three games. Smith led the team in receptions, receiving yards and return yards. Smith's 2,192 all purpose yards were the second most ever recorded by an ACC player behind only C. J. Spiller of Clemson. In the season opener at 12 California, he caught one pass for 28 yards and made two rushing attempts for 16 yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80 yards, rushed twice for 22 yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127 yards, including one 81 yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've got a lot of faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too. Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165 yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112 yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64 yards and a 29 yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000 all purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194 yards and caught a career high ten passes for 70 yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, This kid is probably a better receiver than Darrius Heyward Bey . He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem. Coach Friedgen named Smith the special teams captain for the Virginia game. During the game, Virginia chose to kick short to keep the ball away from Smith on kickoffs, and quarterback Chris Turner did not target him until the fourth quarter. He finished with three receptions for 34 yards and no returns. He recorded two receptions for 13 yards at Duke. At NC State, he caught eight passes for 64 yards and returned a kickoff 84 yards for a touchdown. During the game, he surpassed the ACC single season kickoff return yards record which he had set the previous season. He had four receptions for 55 yards against 21st ranked Virginia Tech, seven receptions for 71 yards against Florida State, and six receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown against Boston College. After the season, the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association named Smith to the All ACC second team as both a wide receiver and return specialist. Phil Steele's and The Sporting News named him to their All ACC first teams as a wide receiver. Phil Steele's and Rivals.com named him to their All ACC second teams as a kick returner. Smith submitted his name to a panel of NFL scouts after the season, which evaluated him as a third or fourth round selection in the 2010 NFL Draft. Smith returned to Maryland for the 2010 season to increase his NFL draft stock, complete his criminology and criminal justice degree in December, and improve the team's record from a 210 finish the year prior. He said, I'll have the same talk with the same people . But my focus is to change what happened last year. Prior to the start of the season, the coaching staff planned to increase Smith's efficiency by playing him fewer snaps in an attempt to keep him fresh. In the RedWhite spring game, Smith accounted for 90 of starting quarterback Jamarr Robinson's 146 passing yards, including a fingertip catch in the end zone on the opening drive, and the two roommates were reported to have developed a good rapport. Before the season, Smith was named to the watchlists for the Paul Hornung Award and Biletnikoff Award. Maryland started the 2010 season against Navy, which intentionally kicked away from the elusive return man. In the home opener against Morgan State, Smith scored on a 24 yard pass from backup quarterback Danny O'Brien and a five yard pass from starter Jamarr Robinson. Smith scored two touchdowns of 60 and 80 yards in Maryland's failed comeback attempt at 21st ranked West Virginia, 3117. After the West Virginia game, Sports Illustrated considered Smith a rising prospect for the 2011 NFL Draft and described him as a true vertical threat who has NFL size and home run hitting speed.

"General Walter Bedell Beetle Smith 5 October 1895 9 August 1961 was a senior officer of the United States Army who served as General Dwight D. Eisenhower's chief of staff at Allied Forces Headquarters AFHQ during the Tunisia Campaign and the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943 during World War II. He was Eisenhower's chief of staff at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force SHAEF in the campaign in Western Europe from 1944 through 1945. Smith enlisted as a private in the Indiana Army National Guard in 1911. In 1917, during World War I, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was wounded in the Aisne Marne Offensive in 1918. After World War I, he was a staff officer and instructor at the U.S. Army Infantry School. In 1941, he became Secretary of the General Staff, and in 1942 he became the Secretary to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. His duties involved taking part in discussions of war plans at the highest level, and Smith often briefed President Franklin D. Roosevelt on strategic matters. Smith became chief of staff to Eisenhower at AFHQ in September 1942. He acquired a reputation as Eisenhower's hatchet man for his brusque and demanding manner. However, he was also capable of representing Eisenhower in sensitive missions requiring diplomatic skill. Smith was involved in negotiating the armistice between Italy and the Allies, which he signed on behalf of Eisenhower. In 1944, he became the Chief of Staff of SHAEF, again under Eisenhower. In this position, Smith also negotiated successfully for food and fuel aid to be sent through German lines for the cold and starving Dutch civilian population, and opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation to the First Canadian Army in the Netherlands. In May 1945, Smith met representatives of the German High Command in Reims, France, to conduct the surrender of the German Armed Forces, and he signed the German Instrument of Surrender on behalf of General Eisenhower. After World War II, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1948. Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA and other intelligence agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower Administration in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961. Walter Bedell Smith was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 5 October 1895, the elder of two sons of William Long Smith, a silk buyer for the Pettis Dry Goods Company, and his wife, Ida Francis nee Bedell, who worked for the same company. Smith was called Bedell from his boyhood. From an early age he was nicknamed Beetle , or occasionally Beedle or Boodle . He was educated at St. Peter and Paul School, public schools 10 and 29, Oliver Perry Morton School, and Emmerich Manual High School, where he studied to be a machinist. While still there, he took a job at the National Motor Vehicle Company, and eventually left high school without graduating. Smith enrolled at Butler University, but his father developed serious health problems, and Smith left university to return to his job and support his family. In 1911, at the age of 16, Smith enlisted as a private in Company D of the 2nd Indiana Infantry of the Indiana National Guard. The Indiana National Guard was called out twice in 1913, for the Ohio River flood and during the Indianapolis streetcar strike. Smith was promoted to corporal and then sergeant. During the Pancho Villa Expedition he served on the staff of the Indiana National Guard. In 1913, Smith met Mary Eleanor Nory Cline, who was born in 1893 and died in 1963, and they were married in a traditional Roman Catholic wedding ceremony on 1 July 1917. Their marriage was of long duration but childless. Smith's work during the Ohio River flood of 1913 led to his nomination for officer training in 1917, and he was sent to the Officer Candidate Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana for officer indoctrination. Upon his graduation on 27 November 1917, he was directly commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was then assigned to the newly formed Company A, 1st Battalion, 39th Infantry, part of the 4th Infantry Division at Camp Greene, North Carolina. The 4th Infantry Division embarked for Europe, then embroiled in World War I, from Hoboken, New Jersey, on 9 May 1918, reaching Brest, France, on the 23rd of May. After training with the British and French Armies, the 4th Division entered the front lines in June 1918, joining the Aisne Marne Offensive on 18 July 1918. Smith was wounded by shell fragments during an attack two days later. Because of his wounds, Smith was returned to the United States for service with the U.S. Department of War's General Staff, and he was assigned to the Military Intelligence Division. In September 1918, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the regular army of the United States. Smith was next sent to the newly formed 379th Infantry Regiment as its intelligence officer. This regiment was part of the 95th Infantry Division, based at Camp Sherman, Ohio. The 95th Infantry Division was disbanded following the signing of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. In February 1919 Smith was assigned to Camp Dodge, Iowa, where he was involved with the disposal of surplus equipment and supplies. In March 1919 he was transferred to the 2nd Infantry Regiment, a regular unit based at Camp Dodge, remaining there until November 1919, when it moved to Camp Sherman. The staff of the 2nd Infantry moved to Fort Sheridan, Illinois, in 1921. In 1922, Smith became aide de camp to Brigadier General George Van Horn Moseley, the commander of the 12th Infantry Brigade at Fort Sheridan. From 1925 to 1929 Smith worked as an assistant in the Bureau of the Budget. He then served a two year tour of duty overseas on the staff of the 45th Infantry at Fort William McKinley in the Philippines. After nine years as a first lieutenant, he was promoted to captain in September 1929. Returning to the United States, Smith reported to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, in March 1931. Upon graduation in June 1932, he stayed on as an instructor in the Weapons Section, where he was responsible for demonstrating weapons like the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. In 1933 he was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Afterward, he returned to the Infantry School but was detached again to attend the U.S. Army War College, from which he graduated in 1937. He returned to the Infantry School once more, where he was promoted to major on 1 January 1939 after nine years as a captain. Such slow promotion was common in the Army in the 1920s and 1930s. Officers like Smith who were commissioned between November 1916 and November 1918 made up 55.6 percent of the Army's officer corps in 1926. Promotions were usually based on seniority, and the modest objective of promoting officers to major after seventeen years of service could not be met because of a shortage of posts for them to fill. When General George C. Marshall became the Army's Chief of Staff in September 1939, he brought Smith to Washington, D.C., to be the Assistant to the Secretary of the General Staff. The Secretary of the General Staff was primarily concerned with records, paperwork, and the collection of statistics, but he also performed a great deal of analysis, liaison, and administration. One of Smith's duties was liaison with Major General Edwin Pa Watson, the Senior Military Aide to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Smith was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 4 May 1941, and then to colonel on 30 August 1941. On 1 September, the Secretary of the General Staff, Colonel Orlando Ward, was given command of the 1st Armored Division, and Smith became Secretary of the General Staff. The Arcadia Conference, which was held in Washington, D.C., December 1941 and January 1942, mandated the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a counterpart to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Smith was named as its secretary on 23 January 1942. The same conference also brought about the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which consisted of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee meeting as a single body. Brigadier Vivian Dykes of the British Joint Staff Mission provided the secretarial arrangements for the new organization at first, but General Marshall thought that an American secretariat was required. He appointed Smith as the secretary of the Combined Chiefs of Staff as well as of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since Dykes was senior in service time to Smith, and Marshall wanted Smith to be in charge, Smith was promoted to brigadier general on 2 February 1942. He assumed the new post a week later, with Dykes as his deputy. The two men worked in partnership to create and organize the secretariat, and to build the organization of the Combined Chiefs of Staff into one that could coordinate the war efforts of the two allies, along with the Canadians, Australians, French and others. Smith's duties involved taking part in discussions of strategy at the highest level, and he often briefed President Roosevelt on strategic matters. However Smith became frustrated as he watched other officers receive operational commands that he desired. He later remarked That year I spent working as secretary of the general staff for George Marshall was one of the most rewarding of my entire career, and the unhappiest year of my life. When Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed as the commander of the European Theater of Operations in June 1942, he requested that Smith be sent from Washington as his chief of staff. Smith's record as a staff officer, and his proven ability to work harmoniously with the British, made him a natural choice for the post. Reluctantly, Marshall acceded to this request, and Smith took over as the chief of staff at Allied Forces Headquarters AFHQ on 15 September 1942. Reporting to him were two deputy chiefs of staff, Brigadier General Alfred Gruenther and Brigadier John Whiteley, and also the Chief Administrative Officer CAO , Major General Humfrey Gale. AFHQ was a balanced binational organization, in which the chief of each section was paired with a deputy of the other nationality. Its structure was generally American, but with some British aspects. For example, Gale as CAO controlled both personnel and supply functions, which under the American system would have reported directly to Smith. Initially AFHQ was located in London, but it moved to Algiers during November and December 1942, with Smith arriving on December 11. Although AFHQ had an authorized strength of only 700, Smith aggressively expanded it. By January 1943 its American component alone was 1,406 and its strength eventually topped 4,000 men and women. As the chief of staff, Smith zealously guarded access to Eisenhower. He acquired a reputation as a tough and brusque manager, and he was often referred to as Eisenhower's hatchet man . Pending the organization of the North African Theater of Operations, U.S. Army NATOUSA , Smith also acted as its chief of staff until 15 February, when Brigadier General Everett S. Hughes became the Deputy Theater commander and the commanding general of the Communications Zone. The relationship between Smith and Hughes, an old friend of Eisenhower, was tense. Smith later accused Hughes of empire building , and the two clashed over trivial issues. In Algiers, Smith and Eisenhower seldom socialized together. Smith conducted formal dinners at his villa, an estate surrounded by gardens and terraces, with two large drawing rooms decorated with mosaics, oriental rugs, and art treasures. Like Eisenhower, Smith had a female companion, a nurse, Captain Ethel Westerman. Following the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower sent Smith forward to report on the state of affairs at the American II Corps. Smith recommended the relief of its commander, Major General Lloyd Fredendall, as did General Harold Alexander and Major Generals Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott. On their advice, Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with Major General George S. Patton Jr. Eisenhower also relieved his Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence G 2 , Brigadier Eric Mockler Ferryman, pinpointing faulty intelligence at AFHQ as a contributing factor in the defeat at Kasserine. Mockler Ferryman was replaced by Brigadier Kenneth Strong. The debacle at Kasserine Pass strained relations between the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting was interrupted by a German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized. For the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Combined Chiefs of Staff designated Eisenhower as the overall commander but they ordered the three component commanders, Alexander, Tedder, and Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham of the Royal Navy, to cooperate . To Eisenhower, this command arrangement meant a reversion to the old British committee system . He drafted a cable to the Combined Chiefs of Staff demanding a unified command structure, but Smith persuaded him to tear it up. Disagreements arose between Allied commanders over the operational plan, which called for a series of dispersed landings, based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks. In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in civilian clothes, where they met with Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but he was unable to negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath an olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled to Washington for two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October. In December 1943, Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy. Eisenhower wished to take Smith and other key members of his AFHQ staff with him to his new assignment, but Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to retain Smith at AFHQ as Deputy Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean. Churchill reluctantly gave way at Eisenhower's insistence. On New Year's Eve, Smith met with General one day later Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke to discuss the transfer of key British staff members from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force SHAEF . Brooke released Gale only after a strong appeal from Smith, but refused to transfer Strong. A heated exchange resulted, and Brooke later complained to Eisenhower about Smith's behavior. This was the only time that a senior British officer ever complained openly about Smith. Whiteley became Chief of Intelligence G 2 at SHAEF instead of Strong, but Eisenhower and Smith had their way in the long run, and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944, with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy. Smith was promoted to lieutenant general and also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in January 1944. On 18 January, he set out for London with two and a half tons of personal baggage loaded onto a pair of Boeing B 17 Flying Fortresses. The staff of the Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander COSSAC was already active, and he had been planning the Overlord operation for some time. This staff was absorbed into SHAEF, with COSSAC, with Major General Frederick Morgan, becoming Smith's Deputy Chief of Staff at SHAEF. Gale also held the title of Deputy Chief of Staff, as well as being Chief Administrative Officer, and there was also a Deputy Chief of Staff Air , Air Vice Marshal James Robb. The heads of the other staff divisions were Major General Ray W. Barker G 1 , Major General Harold R. Bull G 3 , Major General Robert W. Crawford G 4 and Major General Sir Roger Lumley G 5 . Morgan had located his COSSAC headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St. James's Square, London, but Smith moved it to Bushy Park on the outskirts of London. This was according to Eisenhower's expressed desire not to have his headquarters inside of a major city. A hutted camp was built with 130,000 square feet 12,000 m2 of floor space. By the time Overlord began, accommodations had been provided for 750 officers and 6,000 enlisted men and women. Eisenhower and Smith's offices were in a subterranean complex. Smith's office was spartan, dominated by a large portrait of Marshall. An advanced command post codenamed Sharpener was established near Portsmouth, where Montgomery's 21st Army Group and Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay's Allied Naval Expeditionary Force headquarters were located. Ground operations in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith soon realized that he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and it lacked the necessary communications equipment. On 6 September, Eisenhower ordered both SHAEF Forward and SHAEF Main to move to Versailles as soon as possible. SHAEF Forward began its move on 15 September and it opened in Versailles on 20 September. SHAEF Main followed, moving from Bushy Park by air. This move was completed by October, and SHAEF remained there until 17 February 1945, when SHAEF Forward moved to Reims. By this time, SHAEF had grown in size to 16,000 officers and enlisted men, of whom 10,000 were American and 6,000 British. By November 1944, Strong was reporting that there was a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning. Once battle was joined, Eisenhower acted decisively, committing the two armored divisions in the 12th Army Group's reserve over Bradley's objection, along with his own meager reserves, two airborne divisions. Whiteley and Betts visited the U.S. First Army headquarters and they were unimpressed with the way its commanders were handling the situation. Strong, Whiteley, and Betts recommended that command of the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery. Smith's immediate reaction was to dismiss the suggestion out of hand. He told Strong and Whiteley that they were fired and should pack their bags and return to the United Kingdom. On the next morning, Smith apologized. He had had second thoughts, and he informed them that he would present their recommendation to Eisenhower as his own. He realized the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On December 20, he recommended it to Eisenhower, who telephoned both General Bradley and Montgomery, and Eisenhower ordered it. This decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly in 12th Army Group, who felt that the action discredited the U.S. Army's command structure. Heavy casualties since the start of Operation Overlord resulted in a critical shortage of infantry replacements even before the crisis situation created by the Ardennes Offensive. Steps were taken to divert men from Communications Zone units. The commander of the Communication Zone, Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee, persuaded Eisenhower to allow soldiers to volunteer for service without regard to color or race to the units where assistance is most needed, and give you the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder to bring about victory . Smith immediately grasped the political implications of this. He put his position to Eisenhower in writing Although I am now somewhat out of touch with the War Department's Negro policy, I did, as you know, handle this during the time I was with General Marshall. Unless there has been a radical change, the sentence which I have marked in the attached circular letter will place the War Department in very grave difficulties. It is inevitable that this statement will get out, and equally inevitable that the result will be that every Negro organization, pressure group and newspaper will take the attitude that, while the War Department segregates colored troops into organizations of their own against the desires and pleas of all the Negro race, the Army is perfectly willing to put them in the front lines mixed in units with white soldiers, and have them do battle when an emergency arises. Two years ago I would have considered the marked statement the most dangerous thing that I had ever seen in regard to Negro relations. I have talked with Lee about it, and he can't see this at all. He believes that it is right that colored and white soldiers should be mixed in the same company. With this belief I do not argue, but the War Department policy is different. Since I am convinced that this circular letter will have the most serious repercussions in the United States, I believe that it is our duty to draw the War Department's attention to the fact that this statement has been made, to give them warning as to what may happen and any facts which they may use to counter the pressure which will undoubtedly be placed on them. The policy was revised, with Negro soldiers serving in provisional platoons. In the 12th Army Group these were attached to regiments, while in the 6th Army Group the platoons were grouped into whole companies attached to the division. The former arrangement were generally better rated by the units they were attached to, because the Negro platoons had no company level unit training. On 15 April 1945, the Nazi governor Reichskommissar of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss Inquart, offered to open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease the suffering of the civilian population. Smith and Strong, representing SHAEF, along with Major General Ivan Susloparov representing the Soviet Union, Prince Bernhard of Lippe Biesterfeld representing the Dutch government, and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group, met with Seyss Inquart in the Dutch village of Achterveld on 30 April. After threatening Seyss Inquart with prosecution for war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the suffering Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country, and he opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands, to the First Canadian Army, that did follow on the 5th of May. Smith had to conduct another set of surrender negotiations, that of the German armed forces, in May 1945. Smith met with the representatives of the German High Command the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht , Colonel General Alfred Jodl and General Admiral Hans Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as an interpreter. Smith took a hard line, threatening that unless terms were accepted, the Allies would seal the front, thus forcing the remaining Germans into the hands of the Red Army, but he made some concessions regarding a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect. On May 7, Smith cosigned the surrender document alongside Soviet General Susloparov, both representing the Allies, and Jodl, representing Germany. French representative, Major General Francois Sevez, signed as witness. Smith briefly returned to the United States in June 1945. In August, Eisenhower nominated Smith as his successor as commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater, as ETOUSA was redesignated on 1 July 1945. Smith was passed over in favor of General Joseph McNarney. When Eisenhower took over as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, he summoned Smith to become his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Planning. However, soon after his arrival back in Washington he was asked by President Harry S. Truman and U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes to become the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In putting Smith's nomination for the post before the United States Senate, Truman asked for and received special legislation permitting Smith to retain his permanent military rank of major general. Smith's service as the American ambassador was not a success. Although no fault of Smith's, during his tenure the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly as the Cold War set in. Smith's tenacity of purpose came across as a lack of flexibility, and it did nothing to allay Soviet fears about American intentions. He became thoroughly disillusioned and turned into a hardened cold warrior who saw the Soviet Union as a secretive, totalitarian and antagonistic state. In My Three Years in Moscow 1950 , Smith's account of his time as ambassador, he wrote ... we are forced into a continuing struggle for a free way of life that may extend over a period of many years. We dare not allow ourselves any false sense of security. We must anticipate that the Soviet tactic will be to wear us down, to exasperate us, and to keep probing for weak spots, and we must cultivate firmness and patience to a degree we have never before required. Smith returned to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs but General Smith declined the appointment, preferring to return to military duty. He was appointed as the commander of the First Army at Fort Jay, New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and he was suffering from malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, where the surgeons decided to remove most of his stomach. This did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained malnourished and thin. On 7 October 1950, Truman selected Smith as Director of Central Intelligence DCI , the head of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA . Since the post had been established in 1946, there had been three directors, none of whom had wanted the job. The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had produced the Dulles Jackson Correa Report, which found that the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, there was a major intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war. Since Smith knew little about the Agency, he asked for a deputy who did. Sidney Souers, the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council, recommended William Harding Jackson, one of the authors of the Dulles Jackson Correa Report, to Smith. Jackson accepted the post of Deputy Director on three conditions, one of which was no bawlings out . Smith and Jackson moved to reorganize the agency in line with the recommendations of the Dulles Jackson Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure. Four months after the outbreak of the Korean War, the Agency had produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates ONE under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services OSS . Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The Agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates Administration, Plans, and Intelligence. Smith is remembered in the CIA as its first successful Director of Central Intelligence, and one of its most effective, who redefined its structure and mission. The CIA's expansive covert action program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner's quasi independent Office of Policy Coordination OPC , but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI's control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first Deputy Director for Plans DDP , to supervise both OPC and the CIA's separate espionage organization, the Office of Special Operations OSO . Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a Deputy Director for Intelligence DDI . Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its own culture, methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate. By consolidating responsibility for covert operations, Smith made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for them. Smith wanted the CIA to become a career service. Before the war, the so called Manchu Law limited the duration of an officer's temporary assignments, which effectively prevented anyone from making a career as a general staff officer. There were no schools for intelligence training, and the staffs had little to do in peacetime. Career officers therefore tended to avoid such work unless they aspired to be military attaches. Smith consolidated training under a Director of Training and developed a career service program. When Eisenhower was appointed as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe in 1951, he asked for Smith to serve as his chief of staff again. Truman turned down the request, stating that the DCI was a more important post. Eisenhower therefore took Lieutenant General Alfred Gruenther with him as his chief of staff. When Eisenhower later recommended Gruenther's elevation to four star rank, Truman decided that General Smith should be promoted also. However, Smith's name was omitted from the promotion list. Truman then announced that no one would be promoted until Smith was, which occurred on 1 August 1951. Smith retired from the Army upon leaving the CIA on 9 February 1953. On 11 January 1953, Eisenhower, now president elect, announced that Smith would become an Under Secretary of State. Smith's appointment was confirmed by the United States Senate on 6 February and he resigned as the DCI three days later. In May 1954, Smith traveled to Europe in an attempt to convince the British to participate in an intervention to avert French defeat in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. When this failed, he reached an agreement with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, to partition Vietnam into two separate states. In 1953, the President of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, threatened to nationalize land belonging to the United Fruit Company. Smith ordered the American ambassador in Guatemala to put a CIA plan for a Guatemalan coup into effect, which was accomplished by the following year. Smith left the State Department on 1 October 1954 and took up a position with the United Fruit Company. He also served as President and Chairman of the Board of the Associated Missile Products Company and AMF Atomics Incorporated, Vice Chairman of American Machine and Foundry AMF and a director of RCA and Corning Incorporated. After retiring as Under Secretary of State in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower administration in various posts. He was a member of the National Security Training Commission from 1955 to 1957, the National War College board of consultants from 1956 to 1959, the Office of Defense Mobilization Special Stockpile Advisory Committee from 1957 to 1958, the President's Citizen Advisors on the Mutual Security Program from 1956 to 1957, and the President's Committee on Disarmament in 1958. Smith was a consultant at the Special Projects Office Disarmament in the Executive Office of the President from 1955 to 1956. He also served as Chairman of the Advisory Council of the President's Committee on Fund Raising, and as a member at large from 1958 to 1961. In recognition of his other former boss, he was a member of the George C. Marshall Foundation Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1961. In 1955, Smith was approached to perform the voice over and opening scene for the movie To Hell And Back, which was based on the autobiography of Audie Murphy. He accepted, and had small parts in the movie, most notably in the beginning, where he was dressed in his old service uniform. He narrated several parts of the movie, referring constantly to the foot soldier . Smith was portrayed on screen by Alexander Knox in The Longest Day 1962 , Edward Binns in Patton 1970 and Timothy Bottoms in Ike Countdown to D Day 2004 . On television he has been portrayed by John Guerrasio in Cambridge Spies 2003 , Charles Napier in War and Remembrance 1989 , Don Fellows in The Last Days of Patton 1986 and J.D. Cannon in Ike The War Years 1979 . Smith suffered a heart attack on 9 August 1961, at his home in Washington, D.C., and he died in the ambulance on the way to Walter Reed Army Hospital. Although entitled to a Special Full Honor Funeral, at the request of his widow, a simple joint service funeral was held, patterned after the one given to General Marshall in 1959. She selected a grave site for her husband in Section 7 of Arlington National Cemetery close to Marshall's grave. Mrs. Smith was buried next to him after her death in 1963. Smith's papers are in the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene, Kansas. Source Source In Memoriam. General Walter Bedell Smith. 5 October 1895 9 August 1961 . Central Intelligence Agency.

"Wilfred Talbot Smith born Frank Wenham 8 June 1885 27 April 1957 was an English occultist and ceremonial magician known as a prominent advocate of the religion of Thelema. Living most of his life in North America, he played a key role in propagating Thelema across the continent. Born the illegitimate son of a domestic servant and her employer in Tonbridge, Kent, Smith migrated to Canada in 1907, where he went through a variety of jobs and began reading about Western esotericism. Through Charles Stansfeld Jones he was introduced to the writings of Thelema's founder, Aleister Crowley. He subsequently joined Crowley's Thelemite order, the AA, and the Thelemite wing of the Ordo Templi Orientis O.T.O. . In 1915, he joined the O.T.O.'s British Columbia Lodge No. 1, based in Vancouver, and rose to become one of its senior members. In 1922 Smith moved to Los Angeles in the United States, where he, Jane Wolfe, and Regina Kahl tried to establish a new Thelemite community. They founded an incorporated Church of Thelema which gave weekly public performances of the Gnostic Mass from their home in Hollywood. Seeking to revive the inactive North American O.T.O., in 1935 Smith then founded the O.T.O. Agape Lodge, which subsequently relocated to Pasadena. He brought a number of prominent Thelemites into the O.T.O., including Jack Parsons and Grady Louis McMurtry, but he had a strained relationship with both Crowley and Crowley's North American deputy, Karl Germer, who eventually ousted him from his position as Agape Lodge leader, replacing him with Parsons. Smith retreated to Malibu, where he continued to practice Thelema until his death. Smith was born as Frank Wenham in Tonbridge, Kent, on 9 June 1885. He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, a member of a prominent local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his domestic servants, Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would never come to know. Considered an embarrassment by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland. From 1899 to 1901, he studied at Bedales School, where he developed his lifelong hobby of book binding, before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in Kendal until 1906. With few ties in Britain, he decided to emigrate to Canada, arriving in Nova Scotia in 1907, where he gained work on a farm in Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a logging camp, before gaining a job as an accounting clerk at the British Columbia Electric Railway in April 1912. He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it instead he began reading about Eastern religion, yoga, and Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's Book 4 and volume one, number one of The Equinox. Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain based magical order, the AA, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours. Smith entered into a relationship with a woman twenty years his senior, Emily Sophia Nem Talbot Smith, although it remains unclear whether they ever married. With Nem and her daughter Katherine, Smith moved into a specially constructed house designed by the Thelemite architect Howard E. White. Located at 138 East 13th Street, North Vancouver, Smith converted the attic into a temple for Thelemic rituals. Smith also decided to join the Ordo Templi Orientis O.T.O. , an occult organisation whose British branch, the Mysteria Magica Maxima MMM , was run by Crowley, who used it to promote Thelema. In January 1915, Smith signed up to the MMM, and in April went through the Minerval degree initiation at the British Columbia Lodge No. 1. In May, he took part in the Lodge's public performance of the Rites of Isis, which it was hoped would attract further members. In a private capacity, he meanwhile continued performing his AA practices, and also began experimenting with the entheogenic properties of anhalonium. In October 1915, Crowley visited the Lodge, where he met with Smith. Soon after, Smith would be upgraded to the position of Master Magician within the Lodge, and in March 1916 received the Probationer level in the AA, adopting as his personal magical motto the Latin words Nubem Eripiam I will snatch away the cloud . Smith's relationship with Nem was strained, and he began an affair with his step daughter, Katherine. In November 1916, the three of them tried to resign from the O.T.O. lodge so as to prevent their problems affecting the group. Their resignations were rejected, and by January 1917 they were once again active within the lodge. Nevertheless, in March the lodge shut down for 13 months, during which time Crowley and Jones scrutinised Smith's diaries to ascertain his magical progress. Katherine became pregnant with Smith's child, who was born in December 1917, and named Noel Talbot Smith. Jones proclaimed that Noel represented the Crowned and Conquering Child prophecised in the main Thelemite holy book, The Book of the Law. Jones was soon named O.T.O. Viceroy for Canada, and in April he re initiated the lodge at Smith's home, with Smith himself being appointed the lodge's Right Worshipful Master. Jones himself claimed that he had undergone a Great Initiation and was now an Ipsissimus his relationship with Crowley broke down, and he subsequently resigned from the O.T.O., deeply disappointing Smith. Smith meanwhile continued working towards the AA grade of Zelator, while the British Columbia Lodge No. 1 became increasingly moribund following the death of White, a key member, who had succumbed to Spanish flu aged 33 in November 1918. Jones had rejoined the O.T.O. and relocated to Detroit in the United States. When Smith was fired from his job following a bout of flu in February 1920, he decided to join Jones in Detroit, where there was a small O.T.O. community there he gained work as a clerk with the Detroit City Gas Company. In his absence, Nem was appointed Right Worshipful Master of the Vancouver lodge. In March 1921, Jones and Smith proceeded to Chicago, but in June Smith returned to North Vancouver to see his family. That year, Jones convinced Smith to join an esoteric organisation known as the Universal Brotherhood UB . Smith however was unnerved that rather than expressing a Thelemic viewpoint, the UB adhered to Roman Catholicism, and he also considered its literature purposeless, vague, and grandiose he soon dropped out. Back in Vancouver, Smith aided one of his initiates, Frank Page, in founding the British Columbia Lodge No. 3 in Kamloops, creating all the furniture for their temple. Nevertheless, the lodge closed after a year, with Smith's own British Columbia Lodge No. 1 also becoming defunct in February 1922. Unable to find work in Vancouver, Smith headed to Los Angeles in California, United States. On the way he stopped at San Francisco, where he met with Cecil Frederick Russell, a Thelemite who had departed from the Crowleyan orthodoxy to found his own group, the Choronzon Club. Smith however disliked Russell, and later claimed that he had been unnerved when Russell began expressing a sexual interest in children. After settling in Los Angeles, Smith gained a job at the Southern California Gas Company, entered into a relationship with a woman named Ann Barry, and began attending occasional meetings of the United Lodge of Theosophists, an esoteric organisation centred in the city. Jones meanwhile had united Thelema with auto suggestion to found his own group, the Psychomagian Society PMS , and he appointed Smith to be its Local Recorder for Los Angeles out of friendship to Jones, Smith did so, but was uninterested in the PMS' teachings. Through their correspondences, Crowley came to reject the PMS and relations between himself and Jones once again broke down, this time permanently. Smith retained much affection for Jones, whom he saw as his mentor and friend, but nevertheless agreed with Crowley over the PMS and also rejected Jones' ongoing fascination with the UB, which Smith considered incompatible with Thelema their relationship too came to an end in 1926. Now based in Los Angeles, Smith applied for US citizenship but was rejected, due to the fact that in his application he had claimed to be married but he was unable to prove with paperwork. Seeking to promote Thelema in the city, he adopted his own student, Oliver Jacobi, whom he mentored in the AA system, and in the autumn of 1927, he developed a close friendship with fellow Thelemite and Hollywood actress Jane Wolfe. Although he continued to have sexual relationships with other women, Smith retained his love for Katherine, who came to visit him in Los Angeles, where they were legally married on 24 August 1927 at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, the day before she returned to Montreal. She tried to get Smith to abandon occultism and Thelema and return to her in Canada, but he refused, leading her to file for divorce in May 1930, taking sole custody of their child. Smith continued to have sexual and romantic relationships with other women, and influenced by Crowley's bisexuality also experimented with same sex sexual relations, but felt no attraction to men. From July to September 1929, a married woman named Leota Schneider moved in with Smith, and they had an affair, but she soon returned to her husband, while from July to December 1930, Smith began undertaking sex magic rituals with Wolfe, although their relationship remained platonic. Smith soon met Regina Kahl and her sister Leona Lee Watson, whom he initiated into the O.T.O. in early 1931, with Regina also joining the AA. Smith had sexual relations with both sisters, but while Regina with whom his activity became sadomasochistic became romantically attached to him, Lee soon abandoned Thelema. In 1932, Crowley, now based back in England, fell seriously ill, and believing his death to be immanent, he sent Smith a testament proclaiming that in the event of his death, Smith would become Frater Superior and Outer Head of the Order OHO of the O.T.O. he soon however recovered. In May of that year, Smith and Kahl began renting the large house at 1746 Winona Boulevard in Hollywood, and began to take in lodgers to help pay for it. Kahl and Wolfe began using the attic for Thelemic rituals, and in March 1933 they performed their first public Gnostic Mass in the room, hoping to attract interested persons to Thelema. Crowley was pleased with their progress, and asked them to raise funds so that he could afford to visit. The weekly performances of the Gnostic Mass began to attract increasingly large crowds, with their Crowley Nights attracting around 150 guests, among them the film star John Carradine. In April 1934, Smith incorporated the Church of Thelema under US law, although retained the North American O.T.O. as an unincorporated secret society. Crowley however was confused, and believed that Smith had incorporated the O.T.O., something which angered him he subsequently complained about Smith in letters to other initiates. After an argument, Crowley and Smith ceased correspondence for a time. Smith also attempted to revive the largely defunct North American O.T.O., attracting 15 initial initiates, many of whom were dissatisfied members of the Choronzon Club, which was now in decline. With the O.T.O. now being revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, and brought in 7 initiates to the Minerval level in September 1935. He advertised the foundation of his group through an advert in American Astrology magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was. The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, as well as social events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public. In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of Wayne Walker, a proponent of New Thought who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness. Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years. As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted. Activities picked up again when Kahl, who worked as a drama teacher, brought three of her interested students into the group, among them Phyllis Seckler, and other individuals also joined the group, among them Louis T. Culling and Roy Leffingwell. However, the rising number of members caused schisms and arguments, and the Lodge again ceased its private activities from March 1940 to March 1941. They returned to their activities to initiate a couple who had become interested in the O.T.O. through attending the Gnostic Mass, rocket scientist Jack Parsons and his wife Helen. Parsons became enamored with Thelema, although initially expressed both repulsion and attraction for Smith. Smith wrote to Crowley, claiming that Parsons was a really excellent man ... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself ... JP is going to be very valuable . The Parsons would help bring new members into the group Grady McMurtry and his fiancee Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister Sara Northrup. In February 1939 a young college student who had attended the mass, Ayna Sosoyena, was murdered although police drew no connection to the Lodge, sensationalist local tabloids connected the two, although were unaware that the Lodge was involved with Crowley or Thelema. A sympathetic local radio reporter allowed Smith to explain the purpose of the Mass to allay fears of the group, but the interview was never aired in an agreement with local press that they would drop the story. By this point, the Agape Lodge was fully operational once more, although Crowley had remained highly critical of Smith, believing that he was failing to raise sufficient funds for Crowley's personal use. He appointed Karl Germer, a German Thelemite recently arrived in the US, to be his representative on the continent, and instructed Germer to oversee the payment of dues to himself. He also specified that it would now be Germer, and not Smith, who was his chosen successor. Attempting to placate Crowley, in December 1941 Smith stated that all Lodge members now had to contribute 5 of their earnings as an Emergency Fee that went to Crowley. Crowley's criticisms nevertheless continued, and Smith suffered a mild heart attack, retiring prematurely from work at the age of 56 before undergoing an operation to remove haemorroids in February 1942. Smith decided to relocate Agape Lodge to a larger premises, renting the large house at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena from June 1942 for 100 a month, moving many of the lodge members into the house, living as a form of commune and raising livestock and vegetables in the grounds. Parsons had begun a relationship with Sara Northrup, while Smith consoled Helen, who would become his partner for the rest of his life nevertheless the four remained friends. Although they had ceased to publicly perform the Gnostic Mass, membership of the lodge continued to grow. A number of prominent members however left, among them Regina Kahl and Phyllis Seckler. Soon, both the FBI and the Pasadena police department began to investigate the O.T.O. and Agape Lodge, particularly as Germer, now leader of the North American O.T.O., was German ultimately, they decided that the group was no threat to national security, describing it as a probable love cult . Crowley however had remained highly critical of Smith's leadership of the lodge, and ordered Wolfe to send him on a personal magical retreat she felt conflicted, but eventually conceded to Crowley's demands. Both Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith ousted permanently, believing that he had become a bad influence on the other lodge members many of the members, including Jack and Helen Parsons, wrote to them to defend their mentor, but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down, with Parsons appointed head of the lodge. In April Helen gave birth to Smith's son, who was named Kwan Lanval Parsons. In May, Smith and Helen left for a two room cabin in Rainbow Valley with their baby, where Smith undertook his magical retirement. Back in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart, and came to the conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him Smith however remained sceptical. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked Would to God you knew your people better. Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members. In September 1944 Smith went on a second magical retirement, during which he performed pranayama and the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram, invoked Thoth, and recited the Holy Books of Thelema from memory. During the retreat he learned that Kahl, his former lover, had died, which greatly upset him. Returning to his Pasadena home, he was welcomed by Parsons, but Crowley insisted that Smith be shunned by the lodge members, and so he moved back to Hollywood. Increasingly alienated by Crowley's attitude, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. in August 1946. Now renting a house, Smith sought out various handyman jobs, when he learned that Crowley had died and been succeeded as OHO of the O.T.O. by Germer. He became good friends with the art dealer Baron Ernst von Harringa, who commissioned Smith to construct Asian style furniture for his gallery. Smith's own health was deteriorating, and in 1948 he suffered from a number of mild heart attacks. He nevertheless continued to believe in Thelema, and hoped to revive the Church of Thelema through performing the Gnostic Mass once more. Following Parsons' death in an explosion which Smith suspected was a case of suicide Smith was invited to perform the Gnostic Mass in his memory. Although they had long disliked each other, Germer recognised that Smith was the only living individual with a good practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree system, and so put him in contact with Kenneth Grant, who was then trying to revive the O.T.O. in London. Smith and Germer would only meet in person for the first time in June 1956, when the latter was visiting California, and soon after Germer introduced him to young Brazilian Thelemite Marcelo Ramos Motta, who would later grow to despise Smith. Smith purchased a plot of land in Malibu where he built his own house for himself, Helen, and their son, which he named Hoc Id Est This Is It . Construction was interrupted in February 1955 when he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate. This developed into prostate cancer, and mistrusting of conventional medicine, he sought out an alternative treatment at the Hoxsey Clinic in Dallas, Texas, which he visited in December 1956, but they were unable to help him. Smith died as a result of the disease at home on 27 April 1957, subsequently being cremated at the Grandview Memorial Park in Glendale. The Unknown God was reviewed by Robert Ellwood of the University of Southern California for the peer reviewed journal Nova Religio The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions. Ellwood described it as the definitive work on American Crowleyanity , noting that it was the product of 15 years of careful and documented research. He praised Starr's lucid style and the inherent fascination of the material, replete with vivid characters, epic rows, and sexual intrigue .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred%20Talbot%20Smith
"Martha Maria Yeardley Smith jrdli YARD lee born July 3, 1964 is an American actress, voice actress, comedian, writer and artist. She is known for her long running role as Lisa Simpson on the animated television series The Simpsons. Smith was born in Paris on July 3, 1964 and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, she was often teased for her voice. She became an actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing. She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum Overdrive. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and took a recurring role in the television series Brothers. In 1987, Smith auditioned for the Simpsons shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt her voice was too high, and she was cast as Bart's sister Lisa. In 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half hour show, The Simpsons. For her work on The Simpsons, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice Over Performance in 1992. Alongside The Simpsons, Smith appeared in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise, and had recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma Greg and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. She has appeared in several films, including City Slickers, Just Write, Toys and As Good as It Gets. In 2004, Smith performed an off Broadway one woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back A Dinosaur's Story. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting For Ophelia, which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009. Smith was married to actor Christopher Grove from 1990 to 1992 and Daniel Erickson from 2002 to 2008. She enjoys writing and painting. During the first season of Herman's Head, Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists. She released a children's book titled I, Lorelei in 2009 and her story The Race was included in the book Just Humor Me. Smith was born in Paris on July 3, 1964. Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became The Washington Post's first official obituary editor. Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith's parents later divorced. Smith labeled her family upper crust and reserved . As a child, Smith was often teased because of her unusual voice. Smith has stated I've sounded pretty much the same way since I was six. Maybe a little deeper now. She made her acting debut in a sixth grade play. Smith became a professional actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school. After appearances in a number of school plays, she joined the local Arena Stage theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of Peter Pan. She went on to star in several other plays in Washington. She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's play The Real Thing alongside Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Smith's first film role came in Heaven Help Us 1985 . She then played Putter in The Legend of Billie Jean also 1985 . The film was a box office bomb and critically panned, although Smith thought it would be the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died. When filming was over, she rejoined The Real Thing before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over. However, the following year, she played Connie in Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive 1986 , noting it was truly a dreadful film, but I had a great part in it. Smith moved to Los Angeles in 1986 on the semi promise of a part in a TV film. After the audition, the role was given to another actress. Smith realized that people don't mean what they say. It's not malicious. They just don't realize how much impact they have on an impressionable actor and all actors are impressionable. From then on, she decided to just sort of build a wall around myself , to cope with the disappointment of not getting a part. In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of Living on Salvation Street, for which she was paid 14 for each performance, Boys and Girls Men and Women, and How the Other Half Loves, and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the Showtime series Brothers. She appeared in the films The Legend of Billie Jean and Ginger Ale Afternoon 1989 as trailer park girls . She later spoke of her regrets of appearing in the latter in her one woman show More. Matt Groening on Smith's vocal style Smith's longest running role is voicing Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons. She has voiced Lisa since 1987, beginning with The Simpsons shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Lisa's brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming ' Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead. She denies rumors that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voice over work. Pietila stated that, having seen her in Living on Salvation Street, Smith was always her preferred choice. Smith lifts her voice up slightly to perform the role. Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes, she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts. Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in Last Tap Dance in Springfield and Lisa, Jr. in Missionary Impossible both from season 11 in 2000 . Smith spends two days a week recording the show. Until 1998, Smith was paid 30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received 125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid 360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Smith earned 250,000 per episode. After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors received about 400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 25 pay cut, down to just over 300,000 per episode. Despite her world famous role, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind, saying, it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall people never recognise me solely from my voice. In a 2009 interview with The Guardian, she commented It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life. Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992, but felt it was not worth anything, saying there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy. The Emmy for Outstanding Voice Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations. However, Smith says if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson. The show's creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.' Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode Lisa's Substitute , as able to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic. From 1991 to 1994, alongside The Simpsons, Smith was one of the lead cast members in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her more attention than all previous roles combined , and taught her that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees. In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything in one of the film's musical numbers , but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back A Dinosaur's Story. She had a voice over agent for about two years, and I used to go out all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case. In 2004, Smith performed her own off Broadway one woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Directed by Judith Ivey, the play is about her mixed feelings over the success of The Simpsons, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. The New York Times critic Margo Jefferson called it an appealing if overlong show , adding that The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint the best parts of More. It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full. She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting for Ophelia, which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me. Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she believe in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie , and added You can support art even if it's not going to make a zillion dollars. It premiered on April 4, 2009 at the Phoenix Film Festival. In 2011, Smith starred as Ms. Miller in the movie The Chaperone alongside Triple H and Ariel Winter. In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting in the video, Smith and others told the stories of the people killed there. On 30 March 2019, Smith was honored with the Human Rights Campaign's National Leadership Award in Los Angeles for her work as an advocate of the LGBTQ community. Smith married English Canadian actor Christopher Grove in 1990. They were divorced in 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. She married Daniel Erickson in 2002 the marriage lasted for six years and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. In a 1997 interview with The Daily Targum, Smith stated I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to, and that she is a private actress. In 2009, she commented, People have said to me that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better. Smith had bulimia since she was a teenager. She noted It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory. Smith enjoys writing and painting. During the first season of Herman's Head, Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists. The book Just Humor Me includes a story, The Race , written by Smith. She has written a children's book, I, Lorelei, which was published by HarperCollins in February 2009. In 2011, Smith launched a women's shoe line called Marchez Vous.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeardley%20Smith
"Smith's red rock hare Pronolagus rupestris is a species of mammal in the family Leporidae rabbits and hares , and is the smallest member of the genus Pronolagus. The upperparts and gular collar are reddish brown in colour. It has warm, brown, grizzled, thicker hairs at the back of the body, and white to tawny, thinner underfur. It is endemic to Africa, found in parts of Kenya Rift Valley , Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Rhodesia, South Africa Northern Cape, Free State, and North West , Tanzania and Zambia. It is a folivore, and usually forages on grasses such as sprouting grass , shrubs and herbs. It breeds from September to February, and the female litters one or two offspring. Being a leporid, the hare's offspring is called a leveret, or leverets plural . The young leave the nest at three years of age. In 1996, it was rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith first described the Smith's red rock hare in the year 1834. It was originally described in the genus Lepus, and was formerly included in Natal red rock hare P. crassicaudatus . In Swahili, its name is sungura mwekundu or kitengule. The number of accepted subspecies has ranged from zero to eight. One classification from the 1940s accepted the following subspecies Another classification from the 1980s had the following subspecies differences came from moving whitei to P. randensis, including fitzsimonsi, and treating mulleri as a synonym of australis In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, R. S. Hoffman and A. T. Smith listed Smith's red rock hare Pronolagus rupestris as a separate species and included five subspecies. The taxonomic status of the east African Smith's red rock hare is uncertain. It is treated conspecific with the southern African P. rupestris. A paper looking at mitochondral DNA argued that P. r. curryi is the only non nominate subspecies. Mammals of Africa does not recognize any subspecies and rather that curryi, fitzsimonsi, melanurus, mulleri, nyikae, and vallicola are all just synonyms of P. rupestris. The Smith's red rock hare is the smallest member of the genus Pronolagus, measuring 43 to 65 cm 17 to 26 in in length from head to tail, having a 5 to 11 cm 2.0 to 4.3 in long bushy, dark to reddish brown tail with a black tip, and weighing 1.3 to 2 kg 2.9 to 4.4 lb . The upperparts and gular collar are reddish brown in color. The ears are grey, measuring 6 to 10 cm 2.4 to 3.9 in in length, and the hindfeet measure 7.5 to 10 cm 3.0 to 3.9 in in length. It has a brownish forehead, with greyish buff cheeks. The sides of the face are gray, and the nuchal patch is reddish brown. It has pinkish buff coloured underparts, and some white in the mid line of the abdomen. The hind legs and rump are bright reddish brown. It has warm, brown, grizzled, thicker hairs at the back of the body, and white to tawny, thinner underfur. The feet pads are covered by dense, greasy fur. The digits and claws are short and broad, and the limbs are russet, and the frontal bone measures almost the same as the snout. Possibly due to its diet, its flesh is aromatic. It is similar to the Jameson's red rock hare P. randensis which has shorter ears and a longer tail, and the Hewitt's red rock hare P. saundersidae which has a shorter snout bone than the frontal bone. The latter is regarded as P. r. saundersidae by some authorities. The Smith's red rock hare is endemic to Africa, found in parts of Kenya Rift Valley , Lesotho, Malawi, eastern Rhodesia, South Africa Northern Cape, Free State, and North West , Tanzania, and Zambia. It is believed to no longer appear in Namibia. It occurs on rocky slopes and tops of rocky outcrops, in stony countries where grass, rocks, and bush are intermingled. It inhabits ravines with boulders, hillsides, slabs of stones, and rock creaks which provide cover from predators. While a nocturnal species, Smith's red rock hare occasionally comes out during early morning or late afternoon in places where it is not hunted. It is alert at most times, and usually hides prior to being seen. It can also exhibit rapid, startling manoeuvres which are depicted when chased by dogs. The Smith's red rock is observed to vocalize a series of loud, startling screams when running away at night, possibly to scare away predators or to warn other members of the species of potential threat. Despite not being restrained or in pain, it is known to produce shrill voices, contrary to most other leporids. The juvenile can produce churring sounds when caught in hand, and the adult can produce a barking sound when disturbed before sunrise. It is a folivore, and usually forages on grasses such as sprouting grass , shrubs, and herbs. The Smith's red rock hare breeds from September to February. The female makes a nest out of vegetable debris lined with its fur. The nest is about 15 centimetres 5.9 in wide, 10 centimetres 3.9 in deep, and 4 to 8 cm 1.6 to 3.1 in deep. The female has a gestation period of about one month, and litters one or two children, each weighing 40 to 50 g 1.4 to 1.8 oz . The young are altricial at birth, and leave the nest at three years of age, when they weigh about 180 to 200 g 6.3 to 7.1 oz . Although observed to be secluded, the Smith's red rock hare associate closely with dassies. Since 1996, the Smith's red rock hare was rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is commonly found in parts of its range in South Africa, has a large rangemore than 20,000 square kilometres 7,700 sq mi and because its population numbers above 10,000 mature individuals in South Africa alone. Even though the state of the overall population is unclear, it is widespread, and characterized as abundant in Kuruman and Springbok. There is no data about the status of its east African range. Hunting poses a threat to the species and, although not considered to be a severe threat, it is also adversely affected from habitat destruction due to the building of houses on rocky outcrops. Since the 1900s, more than 20 habitat loss has occurred, and if future habitat loss continues at the same rate till 2022, its population decline in South Africa is predicted to become greater than 10 . It occurs in provincial parks, national parks, and wildlife refugees in South Africa, and is also protected as a game species by Provincial Nature Conservation agencies, seasonally.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%27s%20red%20rock%20hare
"Waylon Joseph Smithers Jr., usually referred to as Mr. Smithers or simply Smithers, is a recurring fictional character in the animated sitcom The Simpsons, who is voiced by Harry Shearer. Smithers first appeared in the episode Homer's Odyssey , although his voice could be heard in the series premiere Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire . He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's owner Mr. Burns. Smithers' loyalty and devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little attention should be drawn to it. Smithers' first name Waylon was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers. Smithers was colorized in his first appearance as black with blue hair. Matt Groening, in an interview with TMZ, said that this was a mistake but the producers didn't have enough money to correct it. Smithers is the loyal, obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns, and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag on The Simpsons. In many ways, Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man, and numerous overt allusions and double entendres concerning his homosexuality are made, though some of the show's producers instead interpret him as a Burns sexual . In the season 27 2016 episode The Burns Cage , he came out as gay. Smithers is Mr. Burns' devoted executive assistant. His father, Waylon Smithers, Sr., worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown, when Smithers was a baby. Up till 2016 he was not openly gay, but most people knew he was homosexual before he came out. It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them. Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns, and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as Burns sexual . Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers' devoted adoration, much to Smithers' frustration. Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and, in A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love , Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has rewarded Smithers' devotion with the future honor of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In Homer the Smithers , Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns' assistant and eventually gets his job back. In the season 27 episode The Burns Cage , Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant. Smithers' official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is actually about 2,800 smaller jobs responsible for monitoring employee attendance, and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee of the month awards. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president, but Burns has repeatedly quashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog. Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in Springfield and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club. Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. Jay Kogen said Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay. The script for Blood Feud originally featured Smithers saying Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids , but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon, coined by Mike Reiss, was first used in I Married Marge and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers. Smithers made his first appearance in Homer's Odyssey , which was the third episode of the first season, although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire . In his first visual appearance in Homer's Odyssey , Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by Gyorgyi Peluce, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be Mr Burns' white sycophant , and the staff thought it would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. Silverman retconned this error by saying that Smithers had a tan from a recent holiday in the Caribbean. The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was There's No Disgrace Like Home , the fourth episode of the first season. Smithers wears a brown brownish green suit, white shirt with a purple bowtie. He has yellow skin, glasses and gray light brown hair or brown hair . Smithers' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers' true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode The Telltale Head . Smithers' sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a Burns sexual and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is gay. During the Bill Oakley Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality unspoken and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a Burns sexual , felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay. David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. , he's sort of 'Burns sexual.' In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included. A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson's lesbian sister, was included on both lists. The debate is referenced in The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular , when the episode host, Troy McClure is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is What is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant Smithers You know what I'm talking about. A montage of various clips that shows Smithers' lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant. He's in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing Several of the allusions to Smithers' sexuality have turned into battles with the network censors. For example, in Smithers' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in Rosebud , the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is Marge Gets a Job , which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed Mr. Burns land in a particular position on Smithers' anatomy . There were also issues with the lump in his bed , which the animators said had been drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted. In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition. Mostly in the early seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is. Smithers and Burns would watch Homer usually over a security camera feed and Burns would ask, Who is that man , to which Smithers would reply, That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your drones, organ banks, carbon blobs, etc. from sector 7G. Burns would invariably respond, Simpson, eh In September 2015, it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode. The episode, The Burns Cage , was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully try to move on from Burns. A writer for British progressive magazine the New Statesman felt that the episode was a retcon, making a serious story about the character's homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo that became the target of homophobia. In 2004, The Simpsons producers announced that one of their characters was going to come out of the closet. Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada even claiming Smithers' sexual orientation was about the worst kept secret in Springfield as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the Irish Independent called Smithers too obvious a choice , and the United Kingdom. Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on cartoon gaydar who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97 of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, We've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons. It was Patty Bouvier who came out. In a 2007 article, Entertainment Weekly named Smithers the 16th greatest sidekick of all time. They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being TV's most functional dysfunctional couple . Star News Online named Smithers' fey way as one of the 400 reasons why they loved The Simpsons. In a 2003 article, Entertainment Weekly named the two part episode Who Shot Mr. Burns , in which Smithers was prominently featured, the series' 25th best episode. Gay.com ranked Smithers as the sixth gayest cartoon character. Smithers was made into an action figure, and four different versions were included as part of the World of Springfield toy line. The first shows Smithers in his normal attire with a picture of Mr. Burns at his feet and was released in 2000 as part of wave two . The second, released in 2002 as part of wave ten , is called resort Smithers and shows him dressed as he was at the resort in the episode Homer the Smithers . In 2003, a series of figures exclusive to Electronics Boutique was released, and a set of one Mr. Burns figure and two different Smithers toys based on the episode Rosebud were included. One, called Bobo Smithers shows Smithers dressed as Mr. Burns' teddy bear Bobo and the other, known as future Smithers , shows him as a robotic dog. A future Burns was included in the set as a companion to future Smithers and depicts Burns as a robot as he appeared at the end of the episode.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waylon%20Smithers
"Smithfield is a district in the City of London, located in Central London, England. The principal street of the area is West Smithfield. A number of City institutions are located in the area, such as St Bartholomew's Hospital, the Charterhouse, and Livery Halls, including those of the Butchers' and Haberdashers' Companies. Smithfield's meat market dates from the 10th century, and is now London's only remaining wholesale market in continuous operation since medieval times. The area also contains London's oldest surviving church, St Bartholomew the Great, founded in 1123 AD. Smithfield has borne witness to many executions of heretics and political rebels over the centuries, including Scottish patriot Sir William Wallace, and Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasants' Revolt, among many other religious reformers and dissenters. Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in the second half of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London's public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield's historical identity. In the Middle Ages, it was a broad grassy area known as Smooth Field, located beyond London Wall stretching to the eastern bank of the River Fleet. Given its ease of access to grazing and water, Smithfield established itself as London's livestock market, remaining so for almost 1,000 years. Many local toponyms are associated with the livestock trade while some street names such as Cow Cross Street and Cock Lane remain in use, many more such as Chick Lane , Duck Lane , Cow Lane , Pheasant Court , Goose Alley have disappeared from the map after the major redevelopment of the area in the Victorian era. In 1123, the area near Aldersgate was granted by King Henry I for the foundation of St Bartholomew's Priory at the request of Prior Rahere, in thanks for his being nursed back to good health. The Priory exercised its right to enclose land between Aldersgate to the east , Long Lane to the north and modern day Newgate Street to the south , erecting its main western gate which opened onto Smithfield, and a postern on Long Lane. The Priory thereafter held the manorial rights to hold weekly fairs, which initially took place in its outer court on the site of present day Cloth Fair, leading to Fair Gate . An additional annual celebration, the Bartholomew Fair, was established in 1133 by the Augustinian friars. Over time, this became one of London's pre eminent summer fairs, opening each year on 24 August. A trading event for cloth and other goods as well as being a pleasure forum, the four day festival drew crowds from all strata of English society. In 1855, however, the City authorities closed Bartholomew Fair as they considered it to have degenerated into a magnet for debauchery and public disorder. In 1348, Walter de Manny rented 13 acre 0.05 km2 of land at Spital Croft, north of Long Lane, from the Master and Brethren of St Bartholomew's Hospital, for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the Black Death. A chapel and hermitage were constructed, renamed New Church Haw but in 1371, this land was granted for the foundation of the Charterhouse, originally a Carthusian monastery. Nearby and to the north of this demesne, the Knights Hospitaller established a Commandery at Clerkenwell, dedicated to St John in the mid 12th century. In 1194 they received a Charter from King Richard I granting the Order formal privileges. Later Augustinian canonesses established the Priory of St Mary, north of the Knights of St John property. By the end of the 14th century, these religious houses were regarded by City traders as interlopers occupying what had previously been public open space near one of the City gates. On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings. By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship. The religious houses were dissolved in the Reformation, and their lands broken up. The Priory Church of St John remains, as does St John's Gate, traditionally regarded as the boundary between Smithfield and Clerkenwell. John Houghton later canonized by Pope Paul VI as St John Houghton , The prior of Charterhouse went to Thomas Cromwell, accompanied by two other local priors, seeking an oath of supremacy that would be acceptable to their communities. Instead they were imprisoned in the Tower of London, and on 4 May 1535, they were taken to Tyburn and hanged becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation. On 29 May, the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance to King Henry VIII the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve. With the monks expelled, Charterhouse was requisitioned and remained as a private dwelling until its reestablishment by Thomas Sutton in 1611 as a charitable foundation it was the basis of the school named Charterhouse and almshouses known as Sutton's Hospital in Charterhouse on its former site. The school was relocated to Godalming in 1872. Until 1899 Charterhouse was extra parochial that year it became a civil parish incorporated in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. Some of the property was damaged during The Blitz, but it remains largely intact. Part of the site is now occupied by Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. From its inception, the Priory of St Bartholomew treated the sick. After the Reformation it was left with neither income nor monastic occupants but, following a petition by the City Corporation, Henry VIII refounded it in December 1546, as the House of the Poore in West Smithfield in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII's Foundation . Letters Patent were presented to the City, granting property and income to the new foundation the following month. King Henry VIII's sergeant surgeon, Thomas Vicary, was appointed as the hospital's first superintendent. The King Henry VIII Gate, which opens onto West Smithfield, was completed in 1702 and remains the hospital's main entrance. The Priory's principal church, St Bartholomew the Great, was reconfigured after the dissolution of the monasteries, losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited to the site of the ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, mains water, and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. In 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet 3.048 m of Smithfield possibly delineating a former right of way. After the Reformation, a separate parish likewise dedicated to St Bartholomew was granted in favour of St Bartholomew's Hospital named St Bartholomew the Less, it remained under the hospital's patronage, unique in the Church of England, until 1948, when the hospital was nationalized in the National Health Service. The church benefice has since been joined again with its ancient partner, the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great. Following the diminished influence of the ancient Priory, predecessor of the two parishes of St Bartholomew, disputes began to arise over rights to tithes and taxes payable by lay residents who claimed allegiance with the nearby and anciently associated parish of St Botolph Aldersgate an unintended consequence and legacy of King Kenry VIII's religious reforms. Smithfield and its Market, situated mostly in the parish of St Sepulchre, was founded in 1137, and was endowed by Prior Rahere, who also founded St Barts. The ancient parish of St Sepulchre extended north to Turnmill Street, to St Paul's Cathedral and Ludgate Hill in the south, and along the east bank of the Fleet now the route of Farringdon Street . St Sepulchre's Tower contains the twelve bells of Old Bailey , referred to in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons . Traditionally, the Great Bell was rung to announce the execution of a prisoner at Newgate. As a large open space close to the City, Smithfield was a popular place for public gatherings. In 1374 Edward III held a seven day tournament at Smithfield, for the amusement of his beloved Alice Perrers. Possibly the most famous medieval tournament at Smithfield was that commanded in 1390 by Richard II. Jean Froissart, in his fourth book of Chronicles, reported that sixty knights would come to London to tilt for two days, accompanied by sixty noble ladies, richly ornamented and dressed . The tournament was proclaimed by heralds throughout England, Scotland, Hainault, Germany, Flanders and France, so as to rival the jousts given by Charles of France at Paris a few years earlier, upon the arrival of his consort Isabel of Bavaria. Geoffrey Chaucer supervised preparations for the tournament as a clerk to the King. Along with Tyburn, Smithfield was for centuries the main site for the public execution of heretics and dissidents in London. The Scottish nobleman Sir William Wallace was executed in 1305 at West Smithfield. The market was the meeting place prior to the Peasants' Revolt and where the Revolt's leader, Wat Tyler, was slain by Sir William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London on 15 June 1381. Religious dissenters Catholics as well as other Protestant denominations such as Anabaptists were sentenced to death in this area during the Crown's changing course of religious orientation started by King Henry VIII. About fifty Protestants and religious reformers, known as the Marian martyrs, were executed at Smithfield during the reign of Mary I. G.K. Chesterton observed ironically It is foolish, generally speaking, for a philosopher to set fire to another philosopher in Smithfield Market because they do not agree in their theory of the universe. That was done very frequently in the last decadence of the Middle Ages, and it failed altogether in its object. On 17 November 1558, several Protestant heretics were saved by a royal herald's timely announcement that Queen Mary had died shortly before the wooden faggots were to be lit at the Smithfield Stake. Under English Law death warrants were commanded by Sign Manual the personal signature of the Monarch , invariably upon ministerial recommendation, which if unexercised by the time of a Sovereign's death required renewed authority. In this case Queen Elizabeth did not approve the executions, thus freeing the Protestants. During the 16th century the Smithfield site was also the place of execution of swindlers and coin forgers, who were boiled to death in oil. By the 18th century the Tyburn Tree near the present day Marble Arch became the main place for public executions in London. After 1785, executions were again moved, this time to the gates of Newgate prison, just to the south of Smithfield. The Smithfield area emerged largely unscathed by the Great Fire of London in 1666, which was abated near the Fortune of War Tavern, at the junction of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane, where the statue of the Golden Boy of Pye Corner is located. In the late 17th century several residents of Smithfield emigrated to North America, where they founded the town of Smithfield, Rhode Island. Since the late 1990s, Smithfield and neighbouring Farringdon have developed a reputation for being a cultural hub for up and coming professionals, who enjoy its bars, restaurants and night clubs. Nightclubs such as Fabric and Turnmills pioneered the area's reputation for trendy night life, attracting professionals from nearby Holborn, Clerkenwell and the City on weekdays. At weekends, the clubs and bars in the area, having late licences, draw people into the area from outside London too. Smithfield has also become a venue for sporting events. Until 2002 Smithfield hosted the midnight start of the annual Miglia Quadrato Car Rally, but with the increased night club activity around Smithfield, the UHULMC a motoring club decided to move the event's start to Finsbury Circus. Since 2007, Smithfield has been the chosen site of an annual event dedicated to bike racing known as Smithfield Nocturne. Number 1, West Smithfield is Head Office of the Churches Conservation Trust. Meat has been traded at Smithfield Market for more than 800 years, making it one of the oldest markets in London. A livestock market occupied the site as early as the 10th century. In 1174 the site was described by William Fitzstephen as a smooth field where every Friday there is a celebrated rendezvous of fine horses to be traded, and in another quarter are placed vendibles of the peasant, swine with their deep flanks, and cows and oxen of immense bulk. Costs, customs and rules were meticulously laid down. For instance, for an ox, a cow or a dozen sheep one could get 1 penny. The livestock market expanded over the centuries to meet demand from the growing population of the City. In 1710, the market was surrounded by a wooden fence containing the livestock within the market. Until the market's abolition, the Gate House at Cloth Fair Fair Gate employed a chain le cheyne on market days. Daniel Defoe referred to the livestock market in 1726 as being without question, the greatest in the world , and data available appear to corroborate his statement. Between 1740 and 1750 the average yearly sales at Smithfield were reported to be around 74,000 cattle and 570,000 sheep. By the middle of the 19th century, in the course of a single year 220,000 head of cattle and 1,500,000 sheep would be violently forced into an area of five acres, in the very heart of London, through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares . The volume of cattle driven daily to Smithfield started to raise major concerns. The Great North Road traditionally began at Smithfield Market and mileages were measured from here. The specific start was Hicks Hall, and its former location continued to be used for mileages even after it was demolished, soon after 1778. The road followed St John Street, and continued north, eventually leading to Edinburgh. This ended in 1829, with the establishment of the General Post Office at St Martin's le Grand, which became the new starting point. In the Victorian period, pamphlets started circulating in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the City, due to its extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle. The conditions at the market in the first half of the 19th century were often described as a major threat to public health Of all the horrid abominations with which London has been cursed, there is not one that can come up to that disgusting place, West Smithfield Market, for cruelty, filth, effluvia, pestilence, impiety, horrid language, danger, disgusting and shuddering sights, and every obnoxious item that can be imagined and this abomination is suffered to continue year after year, from generation to generation, in the very heart of the most Christian and most polished city in the world. In 1843, the Farmer's Magazine published a petition signed by bankers, salesmen, butchers, aldermen and City residents against further expansion of the meat market, arguing that livestock markets had been systematically banned since the Middle Ages in other areas of London Our ancestors appear, in sanitary matters, to have been wiser than we are. There exists, amongst the Rolls of Parliament of the year 1380, a petition from the citizens of London, praying that, for the sake of the public health, meat should not be slaughtered nearer than Knyghtsbrigg , under penalty, not only of forfeiting such animals as might be killed in the butcherie , but of a year's imprisonment. The prayer of this petition was granted, audits penalties were enforced during several reigns. Thomas Hood wrote in 1830 an Ode to the Advocates for the Removal of Smithfield Market, applauding those philanthropic men who aim at removing to a distance the vile Zoology of the market and routing that great nest of Hornithology . Charles Dickens criticised locating a livestock market in the heart of the capital in his 1851 essay A Monument of French Folly drawing comparisons with the French market at Poissy outside Paris Of a great Institution like Smithfield, are unable to form the least conception. A Beast Market in the heart of Paris would be regarded an impossible nuisance. Nor have they any notion of slaughter houses in the midst of a city. One of these benighted frog eaters would scarcely understand your meaning, if you told him of the existence of such a British bulwark. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1852, under the provisions of which a new cattle market should be constructed at Copenhagen Fields, Islington. The Metropolitan Cattle Market opened in 1855, leaving West Smithfield as waste ground for about ten years during the construction of the new market. The present Smithfield meat market on Charterhouse Street was established by Act of Parliament the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act. It is a large market with permanent buildings, designed by architect Sir Horace Jones, who also designed Billingsgate and Leadenhall Markets. Work on the Central Market, inspired by Italian architecture, began in 1866 and was completed in November 1868 at a cost of 993,816 88 million as of 2019 . The Grade II listed main wings known as East and West Market are separated by the Grand Avenue, a wide roadway roofed by an elliptical arch with decorations in cast iron. At the two ends of the arcade, four prominent statues represent London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Dublin they depict bronze dragons charged with the City's armorial bearings. At the corners of the market, four octagonal pavilion towers were built, each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins. As the Market was being built, a cut and cover railway tunnel was constructed underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel. Closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcasses to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s. They are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road. The first extension of Smithfield's meat market took place between 1873 and 1876 with the construction of the Poultry Market immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field now West Smithfield , comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The General Market, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 18261830. A further block also known as Annexe Market or Triangular Block, consisting of two separate structures the Fish Market and the Red House , was built between 1886 and 1899. The Fish Market, built by John Mowlem Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones' death. The Red House, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone facade, was built between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets Cold Storage Co. Ltd.. It was one of the first cold stores to be built outside the London docks and continued to serve Smithfield Market until the mid 1970s. During the Second World War, a large underground cold store at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, a mixture of ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete with the development of longer range aircraft, resulting in abandonment of the project. At the end of the Second World War, a V 2 rocket struck the north side of Charterhouse Street, near the junction with Farringdon Road 1945 . The explosion caused massive damage to the market buildings, affecting the railway tunnel structure below, and causing more than 110 deaths. The original Poultry Market designed by Sir Horace Jones was destroyed by fire in 1958. Its replacement building was designed by Sir Thomas Bennett in 196263, with a reinforced concrete frame, and external cladding of dark blue brick. It is Grade II listed. The main hall is covered by an enormous concrete dome, shaped as an elliptical paraboloid, spanning 225 feet 69 m by 125 feet 38 m and only 3 inches 7.6 cm thick at the centre. The dome is believed to have been the largest concrete shell structure built at that time in Europe. Smithfield is the City of London's only major wholesale market Leadenhall Market nowadays attracts more tourist trade which has escaped relocation out of central London to cheaper land, better transport links, and more modern facilities. Covent Garden, Spitalfields and Billingsgate have all relocated . The market operates to supply inner City butchers, shops and restaurants with quality fresh meat, and so its main trading hours are 4 00 a.m. to 12 00 noon each weekday. Instead of moving away, Smithfield Market continues to modernise its existing site its imposing Victorian buildings have had access points added for the loading and unloading of lorries. The buildings stand above a warren of tunnels previously, live animals were brought to market by hoof from the mid 19th century onwards they arrived by rail and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield's public garden, on the south side of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements. Some of the former meat market buildings have now changed use. For example, the former Central Cold Store, on Charterhouse Street is now, most unusually, a City centre cogeneration power station operated by Citigen. The Metropolitan Cold Stores was converted in 1999 into the nightclub Fabric. Smithfield comprises the market as its central feature, surrounded by many old buildings on three sides and a public open space or Rotunda Garden at West Smithfield, beneath which there is a public car park. The south side is occupied by St Bartholomew's Hospital known as Barts in common parlance , and on the east side by the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great. The Church of St Bartholomew the Less is located next to the King Henry VIII Gate, the hospital's main entrance. The north and south of the square are now closed to through traffic, as part of the City's security and surveillance cordon known as the Ring of steel. Security for the market is provided by its market constabulary. In early 2019, it was proposed in plans put forward by the Court of Common Council, the City of London Corporations main decision making body, that Billingsgate Fish Market, New Spitalfields Market, and Smithfield Market would move to a new consolidated site in Barking Reach. Since 2005, the General Market 1883 and the adjacent Fish Market and Red House buildings 1898 , part of the Victorian complex of the Smithfield Market, have been facing a threat of demolition. The City of London Corporation, ultimate owners of the property, has been engaged in public consultation to assess how best to redevelop their disused property and regenerate the area. Former property developers Thornfield Properties had planned to demolish the historic site and build a seven storey office block, offering 350,000 square feet 33,000 m2 of office space, with a retail outlet on the ground floor. Several campaigns, promoted by English Heritage and Save Britain's Heritage among others, were run to raise public awareness of this part of London's Victorian heritage. Grade II listed building protection was approved for the Red House Cold Store building in 2005 by then Culture Secretary Dame Tessa Jowell, on the basis of new historical evidence qualifying the complex as the earliest existing example of a purpose built powered cold store . Whilst the market continues to trade, its future remains unclear following Government Planning Minister Ruth Kelly's instigating a major public inquiry in 2007. The public inquiry for the demolition and redevelopment of the General Market Building took place between 6 November 2007 and 25 January 2008. In August 2008, Communities Secretary Hazel Blears announced that planning permission for the General Market's redevelopment had been refused, stating that the threatened buildings made a significant contribution to the character and appearance of Farringdon and the surrounding area. On 12 October 2012, Henderson Group unveiled its 160 million plan for redeveloping the western side of the Central Market. Henderson proposed that the fish market, General Market and Red House buildings, all over a century old, be demolished to make way for restaurants, retailers and office buildings, while they would restore and retain much of the Market building's original perimeter walls, with a new piazza being created in the General Market. Marcus Binney of the campaign group Save Britain's Heritage said This proposal constitutes the worst mutilation of a Victorian landmark in the last 30 years. Some of the buildings on Lindsey Street opposite the East Market were demolished in 2010 to allow the construction of the new Crossrail Station at Farringdon. The demolished buildings include Smithfield House an early 20th century unlisted Hennebique concrete building , the Edmund Martin Ltd. shop an earlier building with alterations dating to the 1930s , and two Victorian warehouses behind them. In March 2015, the Museum of London revealed plans to vacate its Barbican site and move into the General Market Building. The cost of the move is estimated to be in the region of 70 million and, if funding can be achieved, would be complete by 2021.

"John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England, produces beers including John Smith's, the highest selling bitter in the United Kingdom since the mid 1990s. The majority of John Smith's sales are of the nitrogenated Extra Smooth product, although a cask conditioned variant is available nationally. A stronger variant called Magnet is also available in the North East of England. John Smith's Cask and Magnet are produced under licence by Cameron's in Hartlepool. John Smith acquired the Backhouse Hartley brewery in 1852. Following a series of acquisitions in the post World War II period, the company became one of the largest regional brewers in the country, operating over 1,800 licensed premises. The company was taken over by Courage in 1970 who extended distribution of the brewery's products into the South of England. Courage was acquired by Scottish Newcastle in 1995, and the operations were purchased by Heineken in 2008. John Smith's Extra Smooth and Original are produced at the Tadcaster brewery, as well as a range of Heineken products including Kronenbourg 1664 and Amstel. With a 38 million litre capacity, the brewery is one of the largest in the country. John Smith's became well known for a series of highly successful No Nonsense themed television advertising campaigns, featuring the dour Yorkshireman character Arkwright during the 1970s and 1980s shown only in the South of England , followed by the comedians Jack Dee during the 1990s and Peter Kay since 2002. The brand also has an association with horse racing it was the principal sponsor of the Grand National between 2005 and 2013, the Northumberland Plate from 2003 until 2016, and has sponsored the John Smith's Cup since 1960. Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged the brewery to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds arranged for his son John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together with the arrival of the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise. The operations became sizeable during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Smith died in 1879, leaving an estate valued at under 45,000 around 4.1 million in 2016 adjusted for inflation , and his assets were jointly inherited by his two brothers, William and Samuel Smith a tanner . William purchased Samuel's share of his brother's personal estate, and built a modern brewery in 18834 at the cost of 130,000 9.7 million in 2013 . By this time the company had a staff of over 100. William Smith died in 1886, and the firm was inherited in partnership by his two nephews, Henry Herbert 18631911 and Frank Riley, henceforth known as Riley Smith under the terms of his will. The firm expanded throughout the 1880s by creating an agency network, establishing sixteen offices in nearby settlements, and offering free trade discounts on their beer of 20 percent or higher. By 1889, the brewery was producing 150,000 barrels annually. In 1889, the company's first scientifically trained head brewer was appointed, Percy Clinch, son of Charles Clinch of the Eagle Brewery in Witney. In 1892, the partnership became a limited company called John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited, with Henry Herbert Riley Smith as chairman. In 1899 the company acquired Simpson Co of Market Weighton, with 51 public houses, and converted the brewery into a maltings. By the turn of the century the brewery was considered to be one of the best run in Britain, a byword for first class management . In 1907, John Marples of Sheffield, the wines and spirits distributor, was acquired. In 1907, the company began to bottle its own beer, in Tadcaster. In 1912, the company owned over 250 horses, 41 of which saw service during the First World War. Artificially carbonated beer was first bottled in 1923. Paired horse drays were phased out by 1929. During and for some time after the World Wars, the Government raised the duty on beer, and forced brewers to lower their beer strength. During this period, substitutes for malted barley had to be used for brewing, including flaked barley, oats and rye. The last of the company's dray horses was retired in 1947. Horses had delivered beer to all the areas surrounding the brewery, as far afield as Pateley Bridge. From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by Tilkens brewery. In 1950 there was a general strike in Belgium, and John Smith's hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply. In 1953 the firm became a public company, with fixed assets of around 5 million, 1,000 licensed premises and around 1,100 employees. In 1958, Whitworth, Son Nephew of Wath upon Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses, and the brewery was immediately closed down. In 1959 the company began to bottle imported Alken lager at Tadcaster, in response to growing customer demand. In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg lager. By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses. In 1961, John Smith's acquired the Barnsley Brewery Company, adding 250 licensed properties to their growing estate. The company acquired Warwicks Richardsons of Newark on Trent, with 474 pubs, in 1962. Whilst some product rationalisation took place, popular lines such as Warwicks' Milk Maid Stout were retained. John Smith's closed down all the breweries it acquired, apart from Barnsley, where it invested in the brewery, and added production of John Smith beers to the site, as well as increasing the distribution of Barnsley Bitter. As a result of acquisitions, by 1967 John Smith's was the third largest regional brewer in the country after Courage and Scottish Newcastle, with fixed assets of 30 million. Acquisitions diluted the Riley Smith family stake in the company to around 10 percent. In October 1970, Courage purchased John Smith's in a friendly takeover which valued the company at 40 million 607,740,379 in 2019 adjusted for inflation . By this time John Smith's owned around 1,800 licensed premises throughout the north of England, and as far south as Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and parts of Cambridgeshire and Shropshire. The merged company held assets worth 137 million. By combining Courage's strength in the South of England, and John Smith's in the North, a national brewing company was created. John Smith's bottled Magnet Pale Ale was selected for nationwide distribution across the group, and the takeover facilitated the wider distribution of Courage brands such as Tavern Keg. The Tadcaster brewery was substantially redeveloped and expanded throughout 1974. Courage closed down the Barnsley brewery in 1976 with the loss of 200 jobs, and the 200 Barnsley public houses were supplied from Tadcaster. Courage argued that modernisation of the Barnsley site would have required massive investment. It was reported in The Times that landlords were generally indifferent to the change, as the taste profiles of John Smith's bitter and Barnsley bitter were similar. After successful test marketing from 1974, John Smith's Bitter was distributed in the South of England from 1979 onwards, accompanied by an extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior, the beer was sold there under the name John Smith's Yorkshire Bitter. Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing to the increase in free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer. By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned bitter in the United Kingdom. In 1982, the John Smith's brands included Yorkshire Bitter, Magnet Pale Ale, Export Pale, Sweet Stout, Double Brown and Magnet Old. In December 1983, John Smith's Cask 3.8 ABV was re introduced, seven years after it had been phased out. By June 1985, John Smith's produced 1.7 million hectolitres of beer annually. In November that year, a new brewhouse was opened, at the cost of 5 million. Production of Foster's lager began in 1987. In 1993, John Smith's Extra Smooth was launched in cans. It was introduced in kegs in February 1995, and distributed to 10,000 pubs and venues. It is a nitrogenated version of the pasteurised beer, which was renamed to John Smith's Original in order to differentiate the two products. In 2005, Scottish Newcastle claimed that John Smith's was available in 40,000 outlets across the United Kingdom. In 2007, Scottish Newcastle moved production of John Smith's Cask from Tadcaster to Burtonwood near Warrington, and production of John Smith's Magnet to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool. In 2008 three limited edition beers were released to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the brewery. In 2010 Heineken discontinued production of cask conditioned John Smith's Magnet, although it remains available in kegs. By 2011, production of John Smith's Cask had moved to Cameron's. As of 2012, John Smith's is the sixth highest selling beer brand in the United Kingdom and the highest selling bitter in the world. From February 2013, John Smith's Extra Smooth and Original were reduced from 3.8 to 3.6 ABV. According to Heineken, the decision was taken in order to bring the product in line with the strength of its major competitors such as Tetley, Boddingtons and Worthington. The brewery brews 3.8 million hectolitres annually 1.8 million of which is John Smith's beer , and employed around 300 people in 2008. It has two keg lines, two bottle lines and one canning line. It currently brews and packages the ale brands John Smith's Original, John Smith's Extra Smooth and Newcastle Brown Ale, and the lager brands Foster's, Kronenbourg 1664, Amstel and Tiger. Slate Yorkshire Square brewing vessels were used at the brewery from 1913 until 1975. Stainless steel Yorkshire Squares were in use by at least 1953, but were removed in the 1980s, and the brewery now uses conical tanks. By 1953, the brewery site occupied 20 acres. Wooden casks were still in use in the 1960s. The cask beer line was removed in 1976, but restored in 1984. A new canning line and a new brewhouse were installed around 1982. In 1984 the original brewhouse was converted into a brewery museum. In November 1985 a new 5 million brewhouse opened. Production of Foster's Lager began in 1987. By 1989 the brewery had a production capacity of 1.2 million barrels per annum. Scottish Newcastle used the John Smith's Brewery to brew many of its ale brands. In 2004, a new 24 million bottling facility was opened in 2004, described as the most modern bottling facility in Europe. The Magnet trademark was first registered in September 1908 in Brussels, and symbolised strength. The company's association with television advertising began in 1971 with the Yorkshiremen love it campaign. This was followed by the Big John campaign, which ran in the North of England from 1981, and centred around a re writing of the Big Bad John country music staple. Courage was able to demonstrate to an independent panel that the 300,000 campaign had resulted in a 5 million sales increase in the North. From 1979 to 1986 Gordon Rollings played the dour Yorkshireman Arkwright in a campaign that was only used in the South. The campaign won a large number of advertising industry awards, and was featured on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After Rollings died in 1986 the campaign was continued with Arkwright's successor, Barraclough, until 1991. Despite its success, the campaign was not without detractors, with Deyan Sudjic describing it in The Times as a spurious ... tripe and whippets campaign . From 1992 until 1997, comedian Jack Dee starred in the No Nonsense campaign, created by DDB. The Dee campaign was widely credited with helping John Smith's rise from sixteenth to fourth highest selling beer in the UK as sales increased by 65 percent, and the brand overtook Tetley's as the highest selling ale brand in the world by 1995. The Dee campaign won fifty advertising awards, and helped to turn the rising comedian into a household name. Dee resigned in 1997, and he was replaced in 1998 with a cardboard cut out known as the No Nonsense Man , from the GGT advertising agency. Despite appearing in over 20,000 pubs, clubs and shops, No Nonsense Man was found to have less of an impact than the Dee advertisements. Peter Kay represented the brand from 2002 5 and again in 2010 11. The Kay campaign was described as an advertising phenomenon , and introduced the phrase Ave it into the public consciousness. Between 2002 and 2004 the Kay advertisements won over fifty advertising and marketing awards, making it the sixth most awarded advertising campaign in the world. Despite the success of the Kay campaign, the perceived laddishness of the advertisements were criticised by rival brewer Interbrew as hindering sales of beer among women. John Smith's is a major sponsor of horse racing in the United Kingdom. It has sponsored the Northumberland Plate since 2003, and more than 90 No Nonsense race days are held throughout the year at 28 jump and flat racecourses across the UK. The brand has sponsored the John Smith's Cup originally the Magnet Cup until 1998 at York since 1960, which is the longest running sponsorship in flat racing in the world. John Smith's previously sponsored the Grand National between 2005 and 2013. In August 2012 John Smith's announced a five year sponsorship of the Kirklees Stadium in Huddersfield, home to football team Huddersfield Town and rugby league team Huddersfield Giants, which was renamed John Smith's Stadium . In December 2016, this deal was extended for a further five years.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Smith%27s%20Brewery
"Felicity Megan Smoak, also known by her code name Overwatch, is a fictional character in The CW's Arrowverse franchise. The character was first introduced in 2012 in the first season of the television series Arrow, which is based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow. The series follows the story of billionaire Oliver Queen, who returns home after five years supposedly stranded on a remote Pacific island and becomes a vigilante on a quest to save his city. Felicity is based on the comic character of the same name, created by Gerry Conway and Rafael Kayanan and was adapted for television by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg. Felicity was portrayed by Canadian actress Emily Bett Rickards between 2012 and 2019. Initially cast as a one episode guest star in the first season of Arrow, she returned as a recurring character in the same season, and was promoted to series regular for seasons two through seven when Rickards stepped away from the show. She has also featured in the spin off shows The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and web series Vixen, as well as appearing in Supergirl. The character appears in the Lego Batman 3 Beyond Gotham video game as part of the Arrow DLC pack, and is one of the protagonists of the Arrow and The Flash tie in novels and digital comics. Introduced as having a genius level intellect, with a penchant for inappropriate commentary, Felicity debuted in the third episode of Arrow's first season as an employee of Queen Consolidated, working in the IT department. She is recommended to Oliver Queen by his stepfather CEO of the company Walter Steele, to assist him with an IT issue. She later joins Oliver in his crusade becoming one of the founding members of Team Arrow , alongside John Diggle, and goes on to adopt the moniker Overwatch . She becomes CEO of Palmer Technologies and subsequently founds her own company, Smoak Tech. Her relationship with Oliver develops into a romantic one, leading to their marriage and to her becoming stepmother to his son, William, and later mother to their daughter, Mia. Often cited as a positive representation of women in STEM, Felicity has been described as Arrow's fan favorite or breakout character and has received a generally positive response from critics, with particular praise for Rickards' performance. Critics have described her as an important part of Arrow's success, although at times some expressed concerns that her character became too prominent on the show. In 2016 she was voted number fifteen on a list of 50 Favorite Female Characters , in a poll of Hollywood professionals conducted by The Hollywood Reporter. Early in season one, the creative team behind Arrow wanted to introduce a tech savvy character for a season one scene, drawing inspiration from DC comics catalogue of characters. Producers originally considered using Karen Beecher Bumblebee, but opted to use the less well known Felicity Smoak, a character created by Gerry Conway and Rafael Kayanan for The Fury of Firestorm in 1984. Rickards was initially cast for the role as a one episode guest star, but following a positive response from show lead Stephen Amell and from Warner Bros. executive Peter Roth, as well as from journalists at preview screenings, her role was extended to recurring through out the show's first season. Speaking about the decision to bring Rickards back after her first appearance, Andrew Kreisberg commented that he and fellow co showrunner Marc Guggenheim were just, like, bedazzled by her ... we were all like ... 'Did you see those dallies with Stephen ' ... And then the network called, and then the studio called and they were like 'This girl, who is she ' Showrunner Andrew Kreisberg speaking in 2015 Rickards joined the main cast of the show from season two onwards. Regarding this decision, Guggenheim commented that we reached a point ... with Felicity ... she either has to learn Oliver's secret because otherwise she's just an idiot or she's got to go away. Once we decided that she couldn't go away ... making her a series regular was kind of a no brainer. In terms of the evolution of the character from guest star to main character, Kreisberg went on to state She wasn't in anyone's conception of the show at the beginning. Now we can't imagine it without her and later described her as the secret weapon we didn't even know we had . Speaking about the development of further Arrowverse shows, Kreisberg stated Arrow took awhile to find itself. Arrow needed Felicity Emily Bett Rickards which it didn't have early on . Executive producer Greg Berlanti, speaking as early as January 2013, described Felicity as an integral and active part of the dynamic of the show . Looking back at Arrow's run ahead of its eighth and final season, Amell observed that I don't know that show works if we don't randomly find her . Rickards announced in March 2019 that she would be leaving the Arrowverse at the end of Arrow's seventh season, although producers have left open the possibility of her returning as a guest star in the series final season. Following this announcement, Guggenheim echoed Amell's sentiments when speaking at San Diego Comic Con ahead of the season eight premiere, commenting that For the longest time, I've been saying you can't do the show without Emily Rickards and that he would not have considered a full twenty two episode final season without Rickards. Felicity Megan Smoak is introduced as an IT expert working for Queen Consolidated in her first appearance in the season one Arrow episode Lone Gunmen . In her fictional background story, the character was born on July 24, 1989, and is stated to have demonstrated a strong academic ability from an early age, going on to graduate summa cum laude from MIT in 2009 at the age of 20 with a Masters of Science in Computer Sciences and Cyber Security. Her early years are later expanded upon in the season two episode City of Blood , where she states she was raised in Las Vegas by her mother Donna Smoak, who worked as a cocktail waitress, and in the season four episode Sins of the Father with the introduction of her father, Noah Kuttler. Her father is introduced as a career criminal who Felicity believed abandoned his family when she was seven years old although it is later revealed that her mother had in fact left him in order to protect Felicity from his criminal lifestyle. The character is also stated to be Jewish. Following her promotion to series regular, Rickards commented that Felicity was a character who's intelligent and brave and facing huge situations, and being real in how she's facing them . She also acknowledged the difficulties that the character had at times interacting with people, but admired how she had dealt with that throughout the season. Rickards has described Felicity as having a very mathematical and systematic mind , and sees her tendency to make inappropriate comments as part of that focus stating I don't think they're parts on their own. She's so dialed into what she's doing that when she has to speak, she's not thinking clearly about what's coming out. Describing the character early in season two, Rickards stated that she had lot more confidence and she has this power behind her compared to season one, due to her having a clear purpose. Discussing her motivation, Rickards explained She just wants justice. I think she feels really deeply through other people and that she would be unlikely to be motivated by revenge. Previewing Arrow season four, she felt that at time during season three Felicity had lost a little bit of her strength , and that the Arrow life took up a lot more of her space emotionally and physically. She described two of Felicity's strongest characteristics as her strength and independence, and felt that season four would see her rebuild these qualities. Following Oliver's incarceration and Felicity's enforced exile into witness protection alongside her step son, Rickards discussed the ways in which Felicity had to change going into season seven, expressing that her original mindset is a little broken by events in her life, leaving the character unsure of where now she believes justice and her morals lie . Previewing the season, new showrunner Beth Schwartz echoed similar sentiments, saying Were going to see a different side to Felicity than weve ever seen.....she's going to take matters into her own hands a lot this season. She's going to fight back. Felicity, alongside John Diggle, is shown to play an important role in the transitioning of Oliver Queen from a 'lone wolf' to part of a vigilante team. This working relationship between these three characters has been described both in the media and the show as 'Original Team Arrow', and has received particular praise from critics. Commenting on this symbiotic relationship , terming it Arrow's most important , Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club stated Amell, Ramsey, and Rickards have the kind of lightning in a bottle chemistry that makes all their scenes together hum , in her review of the first half of season two. Similarly, Jesse Schedeen of IGN, reviewing the season three premiere, described the three as the core trio of the show and Jenny Rafferty of Vulture, writing about season four, described the relationship between the three as the heartbeat of the show . Reviewing the season five episode Bratva for Yahoo TV, Robert Chan expressed that no matter how many people you add, this show still comes down to the balance of Oliver, Diggle, and Felicity . Looking back at the series during her review of the season seven finale, Della Harrington of Den of Geek commented that The magic of the show and the magic of his Oliver's team within the show alchemised when John Diggle and Felicity Smoak signed on . Discussing Felicity's role within the team during season one, Rickards described the character as bringing a different dynamic to the table, with an objective point of view . Discussing the character's growth across the first season, she noted how with each new experience with 'Team Arrow' Felicity shrugs off one more restriction that was keeping her held back and that working undercover allowed her to put aside some of her inhibitions, and become someone else for a while . In an interview leading up to the penultimate episodes of season one, Stephen Amell described Felicity as a capable and integral member of the team. During season two, when Felicity demonstrates a sense of inadequacy in terms of her place in the team, Oliver's assurances reemphasize her central role in his mission. Describing Felicity's place on the team, Rickards stated She is a hero. She's not the muscle. She's the brain . She went on to explain that she felt that Felicity being on the team helped her to be more confident with who she is, saying she's also learning to accept and embrace her brainpower, when before she always felt isolated by it . Speaking in 2014, executive producer Andrew Kreisberg talked about the writing team recognizing the importance of the three characters to the dynamic of the show, and working to bring the storyline back to them. The season four premiere demonstrated how important her work as a vigilante is to Felicity, showcasing her reluctance to leave that life for one of domesticity, with her secretly communicating with the team in Star City during her and Oliver's time away. Ahead of the premiere, Rickards commented that Felicity wasn't necessarily aware of how much she was going to be miss it , and found herself asking the question Im missing something. What am I missing . In the season five premiere, she is also the primary motivator behind recruiting new members for the team. As well as using her Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics STEM related skills in her vigilante work, Felicity is also regularly recognized and acknowledged by other characters within the Arrowverse in the professional and academic sphere. When Felicity is first introduced she is shown to be an employee of Queen Consolidated in the IT department. Although in a relatively lowly role, her skills are recognized by CEO Walter Steele, a fact that leads him to both recommend her to Oliver when he needs IT assistance and to ask her to investigate his suspicions regarding Moira Queen's business dealings. During season two, Oliver 'promotes' Felicity to the role of his Executive Assistant, as a cover for their vigilante activities, a role to which she begrudgingly agrees. Following Oliver's loss of his Queen Consolidated at the end of season two, Felicity is the driving force behind his bid to regain the company in the season three premiere. However, rival bidder Ray Palmer Brandon Routh also employs her skills, without her knowledge, to help his ultimately successful bid to take over the company. He goes on to offer her the position of Vice President at the newly renamed Palmer Technologies . Discussing Ray's motivation for hiring Felicity, Routh explained that it was purely because he wants the best brain to help him achieve his goal . Following Ray's supposed death in the season three finale, Felicity is appointed CEO of the company. Regarding Felicity's new role, Rickards noted how she's a lot better at it than she thought she would be and that it is a challenge the character had embraced. When asked about the development of storylines focussed on Felicity's professional life in 2016, David Ramsey, who plays John Diggle, stated, I like the idea that she can be her own person, and she can be strong and feminine, own the company, without pining over men . During her appearance in the season one The Flash episode, Harrison Wells recognizes her name, and states that he follows the careers of 'promising' individuals. The idea of Felicity's own company, in the form of 'Smoak Technologies' is first teased in the season one episode of Legends of Tomorrow, Star City 2046 . Set in a dystopian alternate future, where Star City has been overrun by Grant Wilson son of Slade Wilson , an abandoned building bearing the company's logo is shown. The company is further teased during the Arrow episode of the Arrowverse crossover event Invasion , set during season five, where the building features in the alien induced shared hallucination experienced by Oliver and others, acting as the portal to lead them all back to reality. Previewing season six, showrunner Marc Guggenheim confirmed that the season would see a storyline involving Felicity setting up her own company, but that it would not be called Smoak Tech. A joint venture with Curtis Holt, the company is named 'Helix Dynamics'. The repercussions of the events of season six and the first half of season seven ultimately lead to Holt stepping away from the venture, leaving it in Felicity's hands. Prior to season seven, the introduction of 'Smoak Tech' was once again teased by new showrunner Beth Schwartz and the company was launched in the episode Inheritance . Actress Emily Bett Rickards speaking about Felicity's intellect and appeal Critics have been generally positive regarding the character's role as an IT expert. Writing about the character for the Daily Beast in 2017, Regina Lizik called Felicity the role model your daughter and you are looking for . She also praised the character for breaking what she called the geek ditz complex , for being portrayed as both feminine and intelligent at the same time. Victoria McNally, writing in 2015 for MTV, praised the presentation of science nerds , including Felicity, within the Arrowverse as relatable people and for dispelling the stereotype of scientists as asocial losers . She also welcomed the diversity of the characters, including their family backgrounds. However, during Arrow's third season, Samantha Nelson of 'The A.V. Club saw Felicity as part of a new stereotype for geek girls on television, of women who are smart and competent but in an entirely nonthreatening way . Conversely, Jessica Toomer, writing for Uproxx towards the end of Arrow's fifth season, described Felicity as a fully rounded character, one with agency and abilities and praised the show for flipping the 'geek gets girl' trope on its gender confined head . Jesse Schedeen of IGN welcomed Felicity's new role as CEO in Arrow season four, stating she was no longer a supporting character defined by her relationships to men like Ollie and Ray. She faces her own struggle completely independent from what Team Arrow are currently dealing. This seems like a really promising evolution for her. The character is frequently referenced in articles regarding positive media representations of women in STEM. Advocating for more women to take up careers in the field, European Space Agency engineer Vinita Marwaha Madill referenced Felicity as a positive role model for young girls. Similarly, discussing the lack of women in STEM for ITSP Magazine, Avani Desai included Felicity as one of the intelligent, capable and empowering women in Hollywood's tech world that remain the exception, not the rule . The character has also been cited as a positive role model for young women entering science and technology based careers. The romantic relationship between Felicity and Oliver Queen was a prominent theme throughout the majority of Arrow's run. In the DC Comics canon, Green Arrow is often romantically partnered with Black Canary, and in season one Arrow presented their versions of the characters as each other's significant love interest. However, Felicity's introduction ultimately led producers to change course. Whilst there was no initial intention to develop a romance between the characters of Felicity and Oliver, it was the on screen chemistry between Rickards and Amell that led to this change. Speaking in 2013 executive producer Marc Guggenheim acknowledged that on screen Oliver and Felicity had palpable chemistry , but also that his relationship with Laurel in season one had to sort of play...out before the show could shift focus. Ahead of Arrow's season three premiere, executive producer Greg Berlanti stated that the romantic relationship between Oliver and Felicity was something that we've been working toward and building toward since she first showed up on the show with fellow executive producer Andrew Kreisberg saying the timing was right to further evolve the OliverFelicity dynamic. Rickards speaking in 2018 about the appeal of Felicity and Oliver's relationship. The emergence of the relationship was largely welcomed by critics. Reviewing the episode Taken , in which the couple split up, James Queally of the Los Angeles Times praised the way the show had made the audience care about a relationship storyline in a show built around action, as well as the performances of Rickards and Amell, commenting, with regard to their characters, that they both love each other in a way that jumps off the screen . In his review of Dangerous Liasons in season five, for TVOvermind, Chris King wrote that the episode showed how essential their relationship is to Arrow's DNA . He went on to describe Felicity as Oliver's conscience , and felt that the episode effectively demonstrated how he had become the same for her. Discussing the impact of the couples break up on Felicity whilst reviewing the episode Broken Hearts , Jesse Schedeen of IGN welcomed the way Rickards showed Felicity fighting a losing battle to remain chipper and friendly despite being torn up inside . Reviewing the same episode for Vulture Jenny Rafferty described Felicity's reaction as a very realistic way someone as analytical as Felicity would cope and praised the way the character makes clear she loves Oliver, but, more important, she loves and values herself outside of that relationship enough to step away . Some critics expressed concerns that the relationship became too dominant a feature in the show over the course of seasons three and four. and over the pace of the storytelling, particularly in regard to the couples break up. This issue was acknowledged by Guggenheim who, when asked about any regrets he had before Arrow's 100th episode aired, stated that he regretted the pace at which the relationship moved in season four, saying we had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them and that it was a case of plot overriding storytelling. The relationship proved to be popular with many fans, winning MTV's Ship of the Year in 2015 and 2016. Speaking in the early days of Arrow about the development of a potential romantic relationship between Oliver and Felicity, Rickards stated that the scenes Oliver and Felicity have together are always honest. He doesn't have to hide anything from her, which is spectacular. Series lead Stephen Amell echoed similar sentiments at the start of season two, stating she's the woman at the moment who knows me better than anybody . Discussing the season two declaration of love Oliver makes to Felicity in order to capture his nemesis Slade Wilson, Amell stated clearly he meant it . At the start of season three, Rickards acknowledged that Felicity was also in love with Oliver. Speaking during the season, following the pair's failed first date, Rickards said of Felicity's feelings for Oliver There's just so much love for him that she couldn't imagine not talking to him for the rest of her life ever . When asked in 2015, towards the end of season three, if the show had room for a great love , Amell stated Felicity has clearly, over the course of two plus seasons, grown into that love for him. The couple split up during season four and later reunite in the season five finale. Talking about their relationship over this period, Amell stated I think they both love each other very much and care about each other despite no longer being a couple, maintaining that Felicity remained the person that he's going to go to, if he has something to confide or work through . Rickards felt that the couple still have a really deep connection and regarding their future that you do grow apart, sometimes, before you can grow together . During the 2017 Arrowverse crossover event Crisis on Earth X , the pair marry in a storyline described by showrunner Wendy Mericle as one in which Oliver explores the question of true love . Season seven saw the couple separated due to Oliver's incarceration, and later reunited on his release. Talking about the impact on the couple's relationship, showrunner Beth Schwartz explained that we're really going for the real struggles in marriage. During the 2018 Arrowverse crossover event, Elseworlds , the couple are shown to resolve the issues caused by their separation, with Schwartz stating that Oliver had struggled to come to terms with how the situation had changed Felicity, and that his experience in the crossover enabled him to understand her journey a little more. The episode sees Oliver call Felicity the love of his life , with Schwartz describing the couple as in a good place . She went on to describe them as a team and as a a force to reckon with in their approach to overcoming obstacles. Schwartz described part of the appeal of the couple as the fact that they are opposites, commenting that what Oliver loves most about Felicity is her brain . Rickards has said in interviews that she believes Felicity and Oliver and are soul mates, sentiments Amell has echoed. Asked if Arrow could ultimately have pursued other romantic pairings for Oliver in 2018, Amell stated In our show, it was going to be Oliver and Felicity, no matter what . Speaking ahead of the shows final season, Amell attributed the success of both the relationship and the character of Felicity to Rickards' performance. Felicity's mother, Donna Smoak, is introduced in the episode The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak . Rickards described Felicity as definitely embarrassed by her , but stated that through the course of the episode she ends up accepting her mother for who she is...which is what her mother has taught her to do...Felicity realizes that the acceptance she has for other people sometimes comes later for the people we love the most . She further acknowledged that whilst the pair were very different people, Felicity's emotional intelligence comes from her mother. The relationship develops over the course of the series, with Charlotte Ross, who played Donna, stating they love each other and really support each other and there's a natural comfortability between the two of them and that their relationship had grown into a genuine friendship. She felt the on screen success and popularity of the mother daughter relationship was due to the pair's chemistry and that as actors we fall into a natural rhythm . Rickards commented that Donna brings out something in Felicity that no one else can and how that relationship had evolved the character over time, in particular with regard to Donna being a single woman and having sacrificed so much for Felicity and Felicity being an adult now and realizing her sacrifice is HUGE . She also acknowledged that Felicity had pictured her a certain way , and that learning more about the struggles she faced helped Felicity understand her mother better. Speaking about the impact on the character following the introduction of Felicity's father, Noah Kuttler portrayed by Tom Amandes , also known as The Calculator, in the season four episode Unchained , showrunner Wendy Mericle commented that I think she's really conflicted. She wants to believe that her father loves her and that he has a vested interest in who she is and knowing her and having a relationship with her, and she feels very torn about that . Talking about the pair's difficult relationship, Amandes described Noah as very proud and has lots of feelings for his amazing daughter , despite the animosity between them. Discussing the impact of her father's return towards the end of season four, Mericle stated Felicity would be exploring the question is she a Smoak or is she a Kuttler and give her a new perspective. In season seven Felicity reveals to Oliver that she is pregnant and later gives birth to their daughter, Mia. During the season's flash forward sequences, set in 2040, the audience is introduced to the adult Mia Smoak portrayed by Katherine McNamara. Discussing Mia's relationship with Felicity, McNamara described it as strained , but that she still very much cares for her. Felicity's first significant romantic relationship is shown in the season three episode The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak . Talking about this relationship, with fellow M.I.T. student Cooper Seldon played by Nolan Gerard Funk , Rickards stated It was young love. They were so in love, They had a deep connection. He was Felicity's first experience with love... , and that she enjoyed the experience of playing Felicity being in a relationship that was less weighted . Discussing how the ending of that relationship shaped Felicity's character Rickards went on to say It was definitely a turning point in her life. It was full of turmoil and it was a loss. The character of Barry Allen, who would go on to headline Arrowverse spin off show The Flash, is introduced in the season two Arrow episode The Scientist He and Felicity quickly form a bond, which develops into a potential romantic link.

"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is the eighth episode of the first season of the American police drama television series Homicide Life on the Street. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 24, 1993. In the episode, Howard and Bayliss attempt to quit smoking, Gee discovers secret asbestos removal in the squad room, and Munch and Bolander investigate the beating death of a 14 year old boy. The episode was written by James Yoshimura and Tom Fontana, and was directed by Wayne Ewing, who doubled as director of photography. The episode featured a cameo appearance by film director and Baltimore native John Waters as a bartender. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was originally supposed to be the first season finale, but the episode Night of the Dead Living was moved to the end of the season because NBC programmers felt it was too slow paced to show any earlier in the season. During one scene, Munch and Bolander convince a suspect the copy machine is a dangerous lie detector machine. This was inspired by a real life trick used by the Baltimore Police Department and documented in David Simon's 1991 non fiction book Homicide A Year on the Killing Streets, on which the series was based. It was later used in an episode of Simon's police drama series, The Wire. Since ratings for Homicide had gradually declined throughout the season, NBC announced a decision about whether the series would be renewed would depend on the Nielsen ratings of the final four episodes, including Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . Nevertheless, it was seen by 7.08 million household viewers, which was considered relatively low, although it was an improvement over the previous episode And the Rockets' Dead Glare . Howard Melissa Leo quits smoking, and her partner Felton Daniel Baldwin fears her edginess will endanger his safety. Bayliss Kyle Secor also tries to quit smoking, but tries to live vicariously through his smoking partner Pembleton Andre Braugher . Howard and Bayliss petition Gee Yaphet Kotto to set up a non smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can smoke in the car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him. Meanwhile, an intrusive public works inspector Carter Jahncke tests the air quality at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather Clayton LeBouef and Colonel Granger Gerald F. Gough for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens to go to the media. Meanwhile, Lewis Clark Johnson brags repeatedly to Crosetti Jon Polito about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear view mirror as a gift. Munch Richard Belzer and Bolander Ned Beatty investigate the death of a 14 year old boy found dead in a hospital waiting room. The victim, Percy Howell, appeared to suffer sustained blows to the head from a blunt object but waited days before seeking treatment. Although initially suspicious of the boy's cold and uncaring father Dan Moran , a devout Christian who makes antisemitic remarks at Munch, the detectives eventually question another teen Gavin Goren who spent time with Howell right before he died. After convincing the gullible teen that the copy machine was actually an electrolyte neutron magnetic scanner that could detect lies, they learn Howell was killed by Colin Dietz Joe Fersedi , the teenage leader of a gang called the Zaps, with a baseball bat. Munch and Bolander arrest Dietz, who says he loved Howell like a brother and the beating was an initiation. Bolander is deeply disturbed by Dietz's cold casualness in discussing the murder. Later, Bolander talks to a bartender John Waters about his divorce, and the episode ends with Bolander drinking alone at the bar, quietly singing an Elvis Presley song. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was written by James Yoshimura based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana, and was directed by Wayne Ewing, who doubled as director of photography. The title of the episode refers both to Bayliss and Howard seeking to quit smoking, and to the hazardous asbestos being removed from the squad room. The episode includes a cameo appearance by film director John Waters, who plays a bartender speaking with Bolander in the final scene. Waters, a Baltimore native who develops and sets most of his films in the city, would make another guest appearance in the third season episode, Law Disorder in a different cameo role. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was originally supposed to be the Homicide Life on the Street first season finale, but the episode Night of the Dead Living was moved to the end of the season. Although originally scheduled as the third episode, NBC programmers were worried Night of the Dead Living , which takes place entirely within the detective's squad room, was too slow paced for a series still trying to win viewers. Although Homicide producers felt Smoke Gets in Your Eyes had a sense of resolving storylines, NBC executives believed it was too somber and preferred the ending of Night of the Dead Living , which ends with the detectives happily smiling and laughing. During one scene in Smoke Gets in Your Eyes , Munch and Bolander force a suspect to take a electrolyte neutron magnetic scan test , which involved placing his hand on a copy machine and photocopying his hand as they asked him questions. Prior to giving the exam, the detectives loaded papers with the words True and False into the machine, so when the final copies came out it appeared the machine was giving answers to the questions. The detectives pretended the test was radioactive and dangerous to further make the suspect nervous. This scene was based on a real life trick used by Baltimore Police Department detectives in 1988. The real life instance was featured in Homicide A Year on the Killing Streets, the 1991 David Simon non fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. This hoax was also used in More with Less , the fifth season premiere episode of David Simon's later police drama series, The Wire. Ratings for Homicide Life on the Street gradually declined since the series first premiered. In response, NBC announced to fans that a decision about whether Homicide would be renewed or canceled would depend on how the last four episodes of the season fared in the ratings, including Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . In its original American broadcast on March 24, 1993, the episode was watched by 7.08 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research, earning the episode a 7.6 rating.

"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is the first episode of the first season of the American period drama television series Mad Men. It first aired on July 19, 2007 in the United States on AMC and was written by creator Matthew Weiner and directed by Alan Taylor. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was budgeted at US 3 million. Production for the episode took place in New York City and Los Angeles. Weiner conceived of the script in 2000 while working as a writer for the television sitcom Becker. Before writing the pilot episode, he studied American literature and cinema of the 1950s and 1960s to get a perspective on American culture during that period. Weiner sent the script to The Sopranos creator David Chase, who recruited Weiner to work with him on The Sopranos. Weiner shelved the project for seven years to focus on Chase's program interest for Mad Men did not surface until the conclusion of The Sopranos' final season. According to the Nielsen Media Research, the episode attained a rating of 1.4 1.2 million households upon initial airing. In 1960, in Manhattan, Don Draper Jon Hamm , creative director for the advertising agency Sterling Cooper, is facing a professional dilemma how to sell cigarettes despite increased public awareness of their health risks. He seeks input from customers and his girlfriend Midge Daniels Rosemarie DeWitt , but is unable to find a solution. He rejects academic research results provided by the company's consulting psychologist that suggests some customers will be drawn to smoking despite the health risks because of a collective death wish . Meanwhile, Peggy Olson Elisabeth Moss starts work at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary, where she experiences some sexual harassment. She seems excited to be working in Manhattan, but perhaps overwhelmed by her new surroundings. Office manager Joan Holloway Christina Hendricks advises Peggy on how to be appealing to the men of the office so as to achieve both success in her career and possibly an advantageous marriage. Junior account executive Pete Campbell Vincent Kartheiser makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, for which Don rebukes him. On her break, Peggy attends a doctor's appointment arranged by Joan, during which she undergoes a vaginal examination and is given a prescription for the recently introduced oral contraceptive, Enovid, which at the time was only supposed to be prescribed to married women with their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a sexually inviting gesture to Don, which he rejects. Don and Roger Sterling John Slattery meet with Rachel Menken Maggie Siff , the Jewish owner of a large department store. In order to make Rachel more positively inclined towards the agency, Roger enlists the only Jew in the company, a young man from the mailroom, to attend the meeting disguised as a member of the art department. Don initially thought the man was the owner, not Rachel. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the agency's suggestions of coupons to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that a woman would talk to him in a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men have not respected her plans for her business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete raises the death wish idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject this. Just when it seems that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline It's toasted and a strategy that highlights their method of preparation, which, although it's no different from that of other cigarettes, he proposes will make Lucky Strikes stand out in the minds of the public. The client is impressed, but after the meeting Don expresses his fury with Pete for having gone through his trash to steal the research data. Don meets Rachel for dinner to make amends for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract the maximum amount of pleasure as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world is laid out like a puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a woman rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she allows him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty January Jones , whom he has made no mention of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly from the doorway. Creator Matthew Weiner conceived the script for Smoke Gets in Your Eyes in 2000, while he was working as a writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled The Division . Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. It was what youre always hoping to see, he recalled. It was lively and it had something new to say. Here was someone who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism. Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos' final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series, according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal. Prior to writing the pilot episode, Weiner studied American culture during the 1950s and 1960s, analyzing literary works such as The Feminine Mystique 1963 and Sex and the Single Girl 1962 while viewing such films as The Apartment 1960 and A Guide for the Married Man 1967 . He continued his endeavors when the series' concept began to materialize, as he received a copy of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road 1962 from the executives of AMC. Weiner discussed the look of Mad Men with production designer Bob Shaw and cinematographer Phil Abraham, whom Weiner had previously collaborated with in The Sopranos. Abraham wanted to establish a more genuine approach to portraying society in the 1960s, rather than simply referencing the period as seen in movies of that time. We wanted to be more genuine than that. Movies were an influence. In evoking historical accuracy of elements such as architecture and graphic design, Abraham sought inspiration from the buildings designed by the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. He said, We noticed that in all the Skidmore, Owings Merrill designs of contemporary buildings, the ceilingthe overhead grid of lightswas a strong graphic element in all the office spaces. In one design we loved, the whole ceiling was like a lightbox. It was a time of high modernism, and we embraced the notion of presenting the world in that way. These were new work spacessleek, not stuffy. Jon Hamm was cast as Don Draper, the central character of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, saying that he was the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him ... Jon walked out of the room and I said, 'That guy has lived.' Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. I started, literally, on the very, very bottom, he iterated. I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television. Hamm went through seven auditions his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision making process was told me, 'You got the job.' John Slattery, who was later cast as Roger Sterling, originally auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, I really did prepare the thing and went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, heres the deal. We have a guy. The reason we asked you to come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that youd come in a read for Roger because there wasnt that much Roger in the script.' During production of Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, were not jerking you around here. Were serious about this and Ive really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character and it will be a big part of the show.' Producers of Mad Men approached January Jones to portray Betty Draper, Don's wife and the mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, theres this other role, of the wife. Jones signed a seven year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in Smoke Gets in Your Eyes. Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. Its such a testament to his ability, Jones stated. He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was going to be part of the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven year contract, you want to make sure youre in the show. Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. They said to me, 'AMC ... doesn't have any other big showswhy would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet ' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the pastlet's go with the really good script this time.' Smoke Gets in Your Eyes features guest appearances from several actors and actresses, including Rosemarie DeWitt as Midge and Maggie Siff as Rachel Menken . DeWitt was given a recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, They were at the end of casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I remember thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasnt sure I was right for the part. Maybe the fact that I wasn't this 'vamp' is what made Matt Weiner give me a shot. Prior to working on Mad Men, Siff mainly worked in theatre and performing arts. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was budgeted at US 3 million, slightly more than the US 22.5 million budgeted in typical Mad Men episodes. The pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where principal photography lasted for two days. Most of the production crew were previously part of The Sopranos. After filming concluded in New York, production moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from the one in New York. According to Abraham, Los Angeles contained a continuity that was related to the show. Once we moved to L.A., there was a continuity of style that came from Alan and me, and that was important to Matt . In creating a practical effect, a grid consisting of fluorescent lights was installed onto the set that housed Sterling Cooper's main office. The show's art department bought several 2 by 2 four tube fixtures, which was determined to be accurate relative to the time period. The shipments arrived on the first day of filming the pilot. However, examination by the set lighting crew revealed the lightbulbs used were internally modernized, having been designed to hold T 8 bulbs measuring two feet each. Getting more than 800 2 foot color corrected T 8 tubes became a major issue, and none of the regular suppliers had enough in stock, recalled Mike Ambrose, the gaffer for the production team in Los Angeles. Movietone stopped production of whatever bulbs it was making, retooled the plant and started manufacturing the T 8s we needed. The last shipment arrived the morning of our first day of shooting. Abraham created a light control system in an attempt to keep the overhead from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4 by 8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window. The set containing Sterling Cooper's corporate offices contained skypans fitted with 5K bulbs onto the centers, which measured 8 inches apart. Ambrose collaborated with the production team to institute twenty five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum I beams. Ambrose proclaimed that the flexibility of the trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on the design of the window. He added We also had four 20Ks and a few more T 12s on stands that could be rolled around the office floor. For tungsten close ups, we often used Barger Baglite six and three light units with Chimeras, soft cloth, diaper baffles and 60 and 90 degree honeycomb grids for control. In comparison, Ambrose used traditional lighting when creating the housing for the character, as he favored the color spectrum of a household lightbulb. For example, Don's home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously. We used a lot of batten strips with 100 watt household bulbs, noted Ambrose. The bulbs are so close they're almost touching, so they create a single source that doesn't cast multiple shadows. Over time, we built housings for them with channels into which you can slide diffusion frames or egg crates. We call them 'Whiteys' because the guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey I used them extensively on The Sopranos and felt they suited the homes in Mad Men as well. In the days leading to the Smoke Gets in Your Eyes premiere, the watchdog group Commercial Alert filed a complaint against producers to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Commentators from the group criticized distillery brand Jack Daniel's for its decision to sponsor Mad Men, citing that it violates industry codes that prohibit alcohol marketing, as well depictions of irresponsible drinking, overt sexual activity or sexually lewd images . Robert Weissman, the director for Commercial Alert, stated that based on AMC's website, it appears that the sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of the industry's self regulatory marketing code. He continued There is no reason why a company should be able to escape normal enforcement and implementation of the Code simply because it chooses to violate the code in such brazen manner that curing the violation would cause non trivial complications for a major television series. In association with the complaint, Weissman urged in his letter that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States become more proactive in regulating the distilleries' initiatives in the entertainment industry. Our complaint in this instance is not with the portrayal of heavy alcohol consumption, or even with the glorification of such heavy consumption it is specific to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such portrayals. Quite different issues are raised where artists choose to depict such activities in the absence of industry sponsorship. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was originally broadcast on July 19, 2007 in the United States on AMC. Upon airing, the episode acquired a 1.4 rating 1.2 million households according to the Nielsen Media Research. Total viewership was 75 percent higher than all television programming airing on Thursdays on AMC. Heather Havrilesky of Salon Television commentators praised the pilot episode. Heather Havrilesky of Salon declared that Smoke Gets in Your Eyes raised expectations for future competition at the time, and added that it emulated some of the best episodes of The Sopranos. Chicago Tribune journalist Maureen Ryan said that it was an intelligently made character drama . In his four star review, Adam Buckman of New York Post described it as stunning and suggested that Mad Men just happens to be the finest new TV series of the summer and possibly the entire year . Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle and Brian Lowry of Variety lauded the episode for its historical accuracy Just because they're on the cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around the corner, stated Goodman. That impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to the series. Lowry addressed that despite the subtle approach of Mad Men, it managed to provoke a profound meaning. In that context, the show illustrates that period's own form of excess without wagging fingers, while reminding us that before sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was sexual harassment, free flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads, invariably sung by white guys. USA Today writer Robert Bianco echoed synonymous sentiment Mad Men is a joy to watchthe clothes, the clocks, the furniture, it's like a mid century night's dream. But this is no mere period piece. It's a smart, complex drama that attempts to get through the facades that have always hidden the truth. Troy Patterson of Slate drew comparisons to the HBO comedy drama Sex and the City, and affirmed that it introduced a lewd and cynical perspective of the so called golden age of advertisement. Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker concluded that Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was smart and tremendously attractive , while Seattle Post Intelligencer journalist Melanie McFarland felt that it was a rarity compared to other television installments. Writing for the Boston Globe, Matthew Gilbert remarked that the setting and design were immediately distinguishable. Gilbert wrote, This is a gorgeously fashioned period piece, from its IBM typewriters and rotary phones to the constant fog of cigarette smoke hanging over every scene. The show has a subtle color palette, to match the ivory metal Venetian blinds at the Sterling Cooper ad agency offices, but it may sit in your memory as if it had been filmed in black and white. Citing its authenticity as an episode highlight, Randy Cordova from the Arizona Republic noted that Smoke Gets in Your Eyes was well constructed. Some critics were less enthusiastic than the general consensus. Although The New Republic's Sacha Zimmerman stated that the episode's aesthetic features were comparable to cinematic works, she affirmed that Mad Men lacked any substance, ultimately criticizing the cultural references and the character development presented in the episode. Mad Men seems to be attempting satire without a plan, Zimmerman said. The mood is serious, not campy, and there aren't laugh out loud moments, just a lot of groanersat which point, the show simply becomes a reflection of its characters depressing. It turns out that watching moody, cruel men and unsatisfied, put upon women for an hour just isn't that much fun. Similarly, Tim Shale of The Washington Post concluded that despite the evocative nature of the program, Smokes Gets in Your Eyes fell flat The people in and around them spoil the show, gum up the works and shatter veracity. To New York's John Leonard, the installment felt like a fifties leftover . Commentators praised the performances of several cast members, specifically Hamm's portrayal of Don Draper. Goodman asserted that the acting from the cast members was one of the aspects that carried the show. Gilbert evaluated that Hamm played his character to slick perfection . At the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes won Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series Matthew Weiner . The episode also won Creative Arts Emmys for Art Direction for a Single Camera Series and Cinematography for a One Hour Series. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes also received a nomination for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series Alan Taylor as well as Outstanding Costumes for a Series John A. Dunn, costume designer and Lisa Padovani, assistant costume designer . The episode also won a Casting Society of America Artios Award for Outstanding Casting in a Television Pilot, Drama. Alan Taylor won a 2007 Directors Guild of America Award for Drama Series directing the episode. The episode also earned a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award nomination in Best Sound Editing Dialogue and ADR for Short Form Television for Jason George supervising sound editor , Jed M. Dodge supervising dialogue editor , Julie Altus ADR editor , Dale Chaloukian dialogue editor , and Charlie Kolander dialogue editor .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke%20Gets%20in%20Your%20Eyes%20%28Mad%20Men%29
"Two first class cricket matches billed as Smokers v Non Smokers were played during the 1880s. Featuring players from Australia and England, each match occurred during a tour of one of those countries by the other's national team. The first match was won by the Non Smokers, while in the second, which was drawn, the Non Smokers scored a then record 803 runs in the first innings. The first match was played at the end of the Australian tour of England in 1884, and was held at Lord's in aid of the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society. Eight of the tourists took part four on each side. The Non Smokers batted first, and then forced their opponents to follow on, aided by a strong batting performance from George Bonnor. The Smokers, batting twice, only finished thirteen runs ahead, a total which was chased down without the need for the scheduled third day of the contest. In the second match, held in Australia two and a half years later, the contest once again featured a combination of Australian and English players. Aided by a Arthur Shrewsbury double century, the Non Smokers set a new record for the highest innings in first class cricket, accumulating 803 runs. As in the original match, the Smokers had to follow on, and when the match finished as a draw they were still almost 500 runs behind. The Australia national cricket team toured England in 1884, playing an itinerary of 32 matches, including three designated as Tests. At the end of the tour, an additional fixture was arranged by V. E. Walker, who went on to become president of both the Marylebone Cricket Club MCC and Middlesex County Cricket Club. The match, which was described in The South Australian Advertiser as being novel and interesting , combined Australian and English players into two teams those who smoked and those who did not. The match was played to raise money for the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society, in which it was considered very successful, raising in excess of 561. Walker also wanted the British public to have an opportunity to see members of the Australian touring party play against each other, to which end Alick Bannerman, George Bonnor, Billy Murdoch and Tup Scott represented the Non Smokers, while George Giffen, Percy McDonnell, Eugene Palmer and Frederick Spofforth played for the Smokers. The reporter from The South Australian Advertiser judged that the Smokers had the stronger batsmen, while the Non Smokers had the better bowlers. Lord Harris captained the Smokers, and called the toss wrong the captain of the Non Smokers, W. G. Grace, opted for his side to bat first. The Smokers team amused the crowd by walking out to field smoking cigarettes. The first three wickets fell for the addition of 38 runs Grace scored 10, Murdoch got 4 and Bannerman had 22, bringing together Bonnor and Dick Barlow. The pair added 152 runs together, with the Lancashire professional Barlow playing a supporting role to the Australian Bonnor. The latter scored 124 runs, and according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he batted against Spofforth with such astonishing freedom. Bonnor hit a six and 16 fours during his innings, which was the only score over 50 in the match. Barlow continued to bat carefully, but was eventually dismissed for 39 by the left arm spinner Edmund Peate, who claimed six of the final seven wickets to finish with figures of six for 30, and end the Non Smokers innings on 250. The Smokers began their innings late on the first day. By that stage, the pitch had deteriorated and light was poor, making batting more difficult. By the end of the day's play forty minutes later, they had lost four wickets and only scored 25 runs. They fared better the following morning, but only three batsmen reached double figuresBilly Gunn, 18, Monty Bowden, 29, and Charles Clarke, 20 not outas they were bowled out for 111 just before the lunch break. W. G. Grace was the pick of the bowlers, taking five wickets for 29 runs. A first innings deficit of 139 runs meant that the Smokers were forced to follow on. Beginning their second innings after lunch, there was a little improvement for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top scored for his side, remaining 43 not out at the end of the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground. Two and a half years later, another first class contest with the same title was held at East Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia. The game was played as the penultimate match of the English tour of Australia in 188687, led by Alfred Shaw. Once again the two teams contained a mix of Australian and English players, including three who had taken part in the previous match Barlow and Palmer each appeared for the same team as previously, but Gunn, who had played for the Smokers in 1884, switched teams and was on the side of the Non Smokers in 1887. The touring side had been due to face a Combined Australia team, but as such a team would be missing those players from New South Wales, it was decided to split the teams as in 1884. The match was sponsored by four companies, with prizes of 500 cigars each for the best batsman and bowler for the Smokers, 250 cigars for the best aggregate batting score for the Smokers, another 250 cigars for the best individual score from either side, and 200 cigars for the best bowling for the Non Smokers. The match began in similar fashion to the earlier contest the Non Smokers won the toss, and their captain Arthur Shrewsbury chose to bat first. The Smokers, led by the Australian Harry Boyle, walked onto the pitch smoking cigars. Despite the strong bowling attack boasted by the Smokers, which included Johnny Briggs and George Lohmann, the Non Smokers took advantage of a good batting wicket and accrued 196 runs before the first wicket fell, that of William Bruce for 131. Billy Bates was dismissed shortly thereafter for four, bringing in Billy Gunn. Shrewsbury and Gunn batted together for the rest of the day, and the following morning, building a partnership of 310 runs Shrewsbury was eventually caught off the bowling of Briggs for 236, while Gunn was bowled by Boyle for 150. Fifties from Richard Houston, Harry Musgrove and Jack Worrall in the middle order boosted the score to 803, a new record for the highest innings total in first class cricket. The previous record, 775 runs, had also been set in Australia, by New South Wales. The score fell some way short of the highest innings score in any cricket, which was believed to have been the 920 scored by Orleans Club against Rickling Green in 1882. The score has since been surpassed over twenty times. The Smokers began their response on the third morning of the match, and after losing Maurice Read for 30, Eugene Palmer and Briggs put together a partnership of 160, but both were dismissed before the close of play that day, Palmer for 113 and Briggs for 86. Nevertheless, with the score at 302 for three, it was considered likely that the match would end in a draw. The following morning, wickets fell rapidly Bates finished the innings with figures of six for 73, and the Smokers, who were all out for 356, were asked to follow on. Briggs recorded a second fifty in the match, but otherwise no player made a significant impact, and the game pestered towards the expected draw. The last ball of the match resulted in a situation described by Gerald Brodribb as most unusual . William Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest. Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high scoring match, he defended the delivery and picked the ball up. The fielderswho also wanted the souvenirappealed, and Scotton was ruled out, having handled the ball. The match was drawn, with the Smokers still trailing by 491 runs.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokers%20v%20Non-Smokers
"Tobacco smoking is popular and, at least for men, culturally acceptable in North Korea. As of 2014 , some 45 of men are reported to smoke daily, whilst in contrast only 2.5 of women smoke daily, with most of these being older women from rural areas. Smoking is a leading cause of death in North Korea, and as of 2010 mortality figures indicate that 34 of men and 22 of women die due to smoking related causes, the highest mortality figures in the world. There are tobacco control programs in North Korea, and although smoking is not prohibited in all public spaces, the smoking rates have declined since their peak in the 2000s. All three leaders of North KoreaKim Il sung, Kim Jong il, and Kim Jong un have been smokers and the country has struggled to balance their public image with its anti smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As a percentage of the available arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over represented in North Korean agriculture. Over 4,569,000 adults and 167,000 children in North Korea are believed to consume tobacco daily. It is estimated by the World Lung Foundation and American Cancer Society's The Tobacco Atlas 2014 data that 45 of men, 2.5 of women, nearly 16 of boys and 1 of girls aged 15 are daily smokers, with the average smoker data is likely skewed towards males due to the higher prevalence of smoking in this group smoking an average of 609 cigarettes per person per year. World Health Organization WHO data is roughly comparable, with 44 of men classified as smokers only 33 are classed as daily smokers , whilst North Korean anti smoking authorities put the figure even higher, saying that some 54 of men are smokers. Overall, the average smoker consumes 12.4 cigarettes per day, with this figure rising slightly to 15 per day when just male smokers are considered. The average smoker starts smoking at the age of 23 and the percentage of the population that smokes increases with age until the 5564 age group, after which it declines. On average, people who live in urban areas tend to smoke more cigarettes per day than rural farmers. Data indicates that the prevalence of smoking in North Korea is on par with South Korea, although South Korean men pick up the habit earlier and smoke more cigarettes per day. The high rate of smoking in South Korea is possibly due to it being a capitalist society, where marketing is prevalent and consumption is uncontrolled. However, much of the current information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in South Korea and may not be totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more common than anticipated, but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking. Tobacco first arrived in Korea in the early 1600s from Japan and until around 1880, both men and women smoked. Today, North Koreans consider smoking to be a normal activity for men, but female smoking has become a social taboo. All of North Korea's three leadersKim Jong un, his father Kim Jong il and grandfather Kim Il sung have been smokers. Kim Jong il has called smokers one of the three main fools of the 21st century , along with people who do not understand music or computers. The current leader Kim Jong un is often seen smoking in public, including in university classrooms, subway carriages, and in the presence of his pregnant wife Ri Sol ju, facts that might make the life of the North Korean health educators more complicated. While discussing any negative aspects of the leaders has normally been rare, some North Koreans have recently raised the issue of the apparent contradiction between anti smoking measures and Kim's public image with foreigners. Female smoking is a taboo in North Korea and is considered even more disgraceful than heavy drinking. Women are said to react with shock if you joke that maybe they secretly smoke in bathrooms . Smoking by older women, above the age of 45 to 50 is more tolerated, particularly in rural areas. In comparison, for men smoking is considered such an important social activity that men who do not smoke can become socially isolated at workplaces. Even though most consumer items are in short supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit flavored balls inside the filter to give the cigarette a more distinct flavour. Those who have hard currency can easily buy imported cigarettes from hard currency shops, although these will also stock the best domestic brands such as Pak Ma, comparable in quality to makhorka to convince tourists of the quality of North Korean tobacco. Cigarettes are popular gifts, and tourists are recommended to give Western brands of cigarettes to tour guides. Within the country, cigarettes are used as form of currency in bribery. Those who roll their own tobacco prefer to use sheets of Rodong Sinmunthe organ of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Koreaas rolling paper. One piece of the paper can be used to roll some 4050 cigarettes. According to one defector, when a North Korean starts to smoke the Rodong Sinmun tobacco, he cannot smoke other kinds of tobacco. I used to smoke the Rodong Sinmun tobacco, and after defection, couldn't smoke with Chinese paper tobacco due to the poor taste. Because the Rodong Sinmun is in limited circulation, most North Koreans roll their cigarettes with some other paper. The health impacts of smoking are well documented and in North Korea the high prevalence of smoking has a significant impact on the health of the population. Some 34.3 of men and 22.3 of women are reported to die as a result of smoking, the highest smoking mortality figures in the world, and in total tobacco caused illness kills 55,600 North Koreans annually. Tobacco is only sold at designated shops at a fixed price set by the government. As of 2014 , a 20 pack of the most common cigarette brand costs 246.38 KPW North Korean won 0.21, US 0.27 , whilst the cheapest 20 pack sells for as little as 7.47 won 0.01, US 0.0083 . North Korea has set up specific government objectives for tobacco control and there is a national agency to implement them, with eight full time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking cessation quitline that smokers could phone and discuss their problems, most healthcare facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially, or in full by the state. In addition to regular healthcare clinics, there are eleven specialized anti smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids. There have been attempts at anti smoking movements across the generations in the country, with the earliest major campaign taking place in 2004. While early campaigns had little effect, they have become more frequent in the 2010s and restrictions on smoking have been observed more closely in recent years consequently, since the early 2000s smoking rates have started to decline. There are signs that the North Korean government takes anti smoking campaigns more seriously than they did in the past. According to the WHO, North Korea now keenly celebrates World No Tobacco Day WNTD every year and disseminates information about tobacco use and its effect on health. The Government persuades public health institutions and the media to spread the information about the health effects of tobacco and its adverse impact on environmental protection and economic development. Smoking legislation in North Korea has tightened in recent years, although it is still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on pavements, ferries, aircraft and at stations, in healthcare and educational facilities, pre schools and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs. Some of the legislation is observed with high levels of compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print on the side of the package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging in North Korea. There are no restrictions on tobacco advertising, although there are no advertising campaigns of any kind in North Korean media. Tobacco may not be sold to minors those under the age of seventeen and Cigarette machines are banned. North Korea imposes no kind of tax at all on tobacco, including specific excise, ad valorem excise, value added tax, sales tax, or import duty. Electronic cigarettes are legal. North Korea signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on 17 June 2003 and ratified it on 27 April 2005. The tobacco industry in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares 2.3 of its arable land dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea one of the top 25 tobacco producers worldwide. This is despite 31 of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the DPRK near the border with China. There are many North Korean tobacco companies, making some 30 different types of cigarettes, with the biggest tobacco company being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation. Some companies export tobacco to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the Taedong River Tobacco Company and the Rason Shinhung Tobacco Company, both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin Tobacco. British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, during the years of the Sunshine Policy, high end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency. North Korea is one of the largest producers of counterfeit cigarettes in the world. Leaf tobacco is cheap and can be bought from markets to roll one's own cigarettes. Many rural farmers produce homegrown tobacco on their own plot of land, while others steal tobacco from co operative farms for sale.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking%20in%20North%20Korea
"The Smolensk War 16321634 was a conflict fought between the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth and Russia. Hostilities began in October 1632 when Russian forces tried to capture the city of Smolensk. Small military engagements produced mixed results for both sides, but the surrender of the main Russian force in February 1634 led to the Treaty of Polyanovka. Russia accepted PolishLithuanian control over the Smolensk region, which lasted for another 20 years. In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, the king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Although the Commonwealth nobility quickly elected Sigismund's son Wadysaw IV Vasa as their new ruler, Poland's neighbours, expecting delays in the electoral process, tested the Commonwealth's perceived weakness. Swedish king Gustav II Adolph sent envoys to Russia and the Ottoman Empire to propose an alliance and war against the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was not ready for war. In 1631, the royal army numbered barely 3,000 men the Smolensk garrison was about 500 strong, and most garrisons in the border area were composed not of regular or mercenary soldiers but of 100 to 200 local volunteers. Aware that Russia was preparing for war, in the spring of 1632 the Sejm PolishLithuanian parliament increased the army by recruiting an additional 4,500 men by mid 1632 the deputy voivode podwojewoda of Smolensk, Samuel Drucki Sokolinski, had about 500 volunteers from pospolite ruszenie and 2,500 regular army soldiers and Cossacks. In May the Senate of Poland agreed to increase the size of the army, but Grand Lithuanian Hetman Lew Sapieha objected, arguing that the current forces were enough and that war was not likely. Nonetheless the Field Lithuanian Hetman Krzysztof Radziwi recruited an additional 2,000 soldiers. Russia, having recovered to a certain extent from the Time of Troubles, agreed with the assessment that the Commonwealth would be weakened by the death of its king, and unilaterally attacked without waiting for the Swedes and the Ottomans. Russia's aim was to gain control of Smolensk, which it had ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino, ending the last Russo Polish War. Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smolensk Voivodeship, but it had often been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries from the days of the MuscoviteLithuanian Wars . A major supporter of the war was the Tsar's father, Patriarch Filaret, who represented the anti Polish camp at court. Inspired by the Zemsky Sobor's Russian parliament's call for vengeance and reclamation of lost lands, the Russian army sallied west. The Russian army that crossed the Lithuanian border in early October 1632 had been carefully prepared and was under the experienced command of Mikhail Borisovich Shein, who had previously defended Smolensk against the Poles during the 16091611 siege. Several towns and castles fell as the Russians advanced, and on 28 October 1632 the same day that the historic town of Dorogobuzh was taken , Shein moved to begin the siege of Smolensk. Former Polish estimates of the size of the Russian forces varied from 25,000 through 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces. Recent research on 17th century Russian archive documents showed that the size of the Russian army was 23,961. Compared to former Russian armies, Shein's army was significantly modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket equipped infantry the streltsy , the Russians looked to foreign officers to update the equipment and training of their troops based on the Western European model of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised part of Shein's army. Commonwealth forces in Smolensk were composed of the Smolensk garrison about 1,600 men with 170 artillery pieces under the command of the Voivode of Smolensk, Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski , strengthened by the local nobility, which formed a pospolite ruszenie force of about 1,500 strong. The city's fortifications had also recently been improved with Italian style bastions. Shein constructed lines of circumvallation around the fortress. Using tunnels and mines, his forces damaged a long section of the city wall and one of its towers. Russian heavy artillery, mostly of Western manufacture, reached Smolensk in December 1632 with even heavier guns arriving the following March. After a preliminary artillery bombardment, Shein ordered an assault, which was repulsed by the Polish defenders. Nonetheless the siege was progressing Smolensk's fortifications were being eroded, and the defenders were suffering heavy casualties and running out of supplies. By June 1633, some soldiers started to desert, and others talked of surrender. Despite these difficulties, the city, commanded by Deputy Voivode Samuel Drucki Sokolinski, held out throughout 1633 while the Commonwealth, under its newly elected King Wadysaw IV, organised a relief force. The Sejm had been informed about the Russian invasion by 30 October 1632, and, starting in November, had discussed the possibility of relief. However, the process was delayed until the spring of 1633, when the Sejm officially sanctioned a declaration of war and authorised a large payment 6.5 million zlotys, the highest tax contribution during Wadysaw's entire reign for the raising of a suitable force. The intended relief force would have an effective strength of about 21,500 men and would include 24 choragiews of Winged Hussars 3,200 horses , 27 choragiews of light cavalryalso known as Cossack cavalry but not composed of Cossacks 3,600 horses , 10 squadrons of raitars 1,700 horses , 7 Lithuanian petyhor regiments 780 horses , 7 large regiments of dragoons 2,250 horses , and 20 regiments of infantry 12,000 men . Over 10,000 of the infantry would be organized based on the Western model, previously not common in Commonwealth armies. Meanwhile, Field Hetman of Lithuania and Voivode of Vilnius, Krzysztof Radziwi, and Voivode Gosiewski established a camp about 30 kilometres 18.6 mi from Smolensk, moving from Orsha to Bajow and later, Krasne. By February 1633, they had amassed around 4,500 soldiers, including over 2,000 infantry, and were engaged in raiding the rear areas of the Russian besiegers to disrupt their logistics. Hetman Radziwi also managed to break through the Russian lines on several occasions, bringing about 1,000 soldiers and supplies into Smolensk to reinforce the fortress and raising the defenders' morale. By the summer of 1633, the relief force, led personally by the king and numbering about 25,000 20,000 in the PolishLithuanian army, according to Jasienica , arrived near Smolensk they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633. By the first days of September, the main body of the relief forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14,000. The Russian army, recently reinforced, numbered 25,000. Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Tymosz Timofiy Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski raided the Russian rear lines, freeing the PolishLithuanian units under Radziwi and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege. Wadysaw's brother, John II Casimir, commanded one of the regiments in the relief army. Another notable commander was the Field Crown Hetman, Marcin Kazanowski. King Wadysaw IV, a great supporter of the modernization of the Commonwealth army, proved to be a good tactician, and his innovations in the use of artillery and fortifications based on Western ideas greatly contributed to the eventual PolishLithuanian success. He had replaced the old arquebusiers with musketeers, and standardized the Commonwealth artillery introducing 3 to 6 pounder regimental guns , both to great effect. Commonwealth's cavalry, including the Winged Hussars, significantly restricted Russian mobility, forcing them to stay in their trenches. In a series of fierce engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications, and the siege reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken. Shein's army retreated to its main camp, which was in turn surrounded by Commonwealth forces in mid October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry had been sent to disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness. Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries. The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homeland. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side. Shein began surrender negotiations in January 1634, and by February they were in full swing. The Russians finally signed a surrender treaty on 25 February 1634, and on 1 March they vacated their camp. Some scholars, such as Rickard and Black, give the date of 1 March for Shein's capitulation. Under the surrender terms, the Russians had to leave behind most of their artillery but were allowed to retain their banners after a ceremony in which they were laid before King Wadysaw. They also had to promise not to engage Commonwealth forces for the next three months. Shein's forces numbered around 12,000 at the time of their capitulation, but over 4,000, including most of the foreign contingent, immediately decided to defect to the Commonwealth. Several other towns and fortresses in the region were the site of smaller battles. Russian forces captured several significant locations during their advance in 1632, but Nagielski speculates that the delay in the arrival of their main force and artillery at Smolensk caused by this dilution of effort may have cost them the siege and consequently the war. In July 1633, the Russians took the towns of Polatsk, Velizh, Usvyat, and Ozerishche. Polatsk was the scene of particularly heavy fighting as the Russians captured the city and part of the fortress. However, attacks on Vitebsk and Mstsislaw were successfully repulsed. Polish forces laid siege to Putivl, but due to the desertion of their Cossack allies they were forced to withdraw. In the autumn of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an important Russian supply point after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000 strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisaw Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion in the south of the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, preventing them from moving north towards Smolensk. After the relief of Smolensk in the spring of 1634, the Commonwealth army moved towards the fortress Belaya. However, the siege of Belaya turned to a fiasco although the king manage to capture Vyazma. By the spring of 1634, the Russians had not only lost Shein's army but were threatened by Tatar raids that ravaged southern Russia. Patriarch Filaret had died the previous year, and without him the war fervour lessened. Even before the end of 1633, Tsar Michael of Russia was considering how best to end the conflict. Because he had once been elected Tsar of Russia and could realistically lay claim to the Russian throne, King Wadysaw wanted to continue the war or, because the Polish Swedish Treaty of Altmark would soon be expiring, ally with the Russians to strike against Sweden. However, the Sejm wanted no more conflict. As Stanisaw ubienski, the Bishop of Pock, wrote two weeks after Shein's surrender Our happiness is in remaining within our borders, guaranteeing health and well being. With neither side keen on prolonging the war, they began negotiating, not for an armistice but for eternal peace. Talks began on 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka was signed in May, putting an end to hostilities. The treaty confirmed the pre war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity 20,000 rubles in gold , while Wadysaw agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Wadysaw's abnegation of his claim was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation. Already during the later stages of the war, when the Commonwealth army moved from Smolensk to Bely, a new threat begun to loom on the southern borders, where the Ottoman Empire was massing an invasion force. Thus Wadysaw began redirecting his reinforcements to that theater. Later that year, the Commonwealth forces under Stanisaw Koniecpolski scored a victory in the south, ending a war against the Ottomans. Both sides introduced new tactics, units and equipment based on Western models, but the PolishLithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors that kept the Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second in command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the PolishRussian War 16541656 . After the war, Wadysaw gave the Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping to persuade the Tsar to join in an anti Swedish alliance. However, the king was ultimately unable to overcome objections from the PolishLithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wies. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing. The war cost the Commonwealth treasury about 4,300,000 zloties. The Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription SMOLENSK 18 X 163225 II 1634 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smolensk%20War
"From 2010 to 2014, Smooth Radio was an independent, commercial, national radio station in the United Kingdom. Owned by Real and Smootha company formerly known as GMG Radiothe station was aimed at the over 40 demographic, and competed for its audience with BBC Radio 2. It was broadcast on the DAB Digital Radio Digital 1 national multiplex, Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media, online and on regional FM and DAB frequencies in the North West, London, North East, West Midlands, Scotland and East Midlands. Nationally the station attracted a weekly average audience of 3 million. The station opened in 1990 as 102.2 Jazz FM in London, and a second Jazz FM branded station was launched four years later in Manchester. The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004, and was the first in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand. The London station followed suit a year later. The network's parent company, GMG Radio a subsidiary of the Guardian Media Group acquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid 2000s, and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name. After the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio, and the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co locate or discontinue local shows and broadcasts, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single, quasi national station in October 2010 local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows, but carried networked programming at other times. As part of their licence agreement, the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name, and the UK's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications Ofcom stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week, but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place. Smooth recruited many well known British radio personalities to its line up. Presenters on the network included Emma B, Simon Bates, Tony Blackburn, Mark Goodier, David Jensen and Chris Tarrant. The station's flagship breakfast show was presented by Simon Bates, who left Classic FM after more than a decade. It broadcast occasional documentaries on subjects relating to music, news and media events some of these won the station radio industry awards. In November 2011 Smooth launched a second station on the Digital One platform dedicated to Christmas music, and later replaced this with Smooth 70s , which played music from the 1970s. The Christmas station returned in 2012, and Smooth 70s closed in September 2013. Along with its sister station, Real Radio, Smooth was an official host of the Blackpool Illuminations switch on ceremony from 2010, and staged regular, free live music events. The station signed a number of sponsorship deals with companies such as Tetley Tea and ATS Euromaster, and held annual fundraising events in aid of the charities Help for Heroes and Macmillan Cancer Support. GMG Radio was taken over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's purchase of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large as a result of the deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014. London station 102.2 Jazz FM was launched on 4 March 1990 with a concert performed by Ella Fitzgerald at the Royal Albert Hall. Jazz FM played mainly soul and jazz music and was broadcast to the London area. A sister station in Manchester called 100.4 Jazz FM was launched on 1 September 1994. The Jazz FM stations were purchased by the Guardian Media Group in 2002, and became part of the company's radio division, GMG Radio Holdings Ltd. In 2003, GMG radio conducted market research into the type of music that listeners in the north west of England wanted to hear on the radio. The study concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name Jazz, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 1 March. In 2005, GMG rebranded the London station 102.2 Smooth FM. The two renamed stations played middle of the road music, soul and R B during the day and as part of their licence requirements, jazz music at night. On 20 October 2006, GMG Radio announced that it was requesting a change of format for 102.2 and 100.4 Smooth FM from Ofcom, to remove the stations' daytime soul and R B licence commitments. GMG Radio proposed an easy listening music service mixed with speech for the over 50s, and an improved local news service. Ofcom approved the changes on 8 December 2006, with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per week that constituted part of the former licence requirement. As a result of the format change and to distance the station from its London rivals Magic and Heart 106.2, GMG Radio agreed that a minimum of 20 of its daytime music output would be over 40 years old. In December 2006, GMG Radio acquired the Saga Radio Group, which owned stations in the West Midlands, East Midlands and Scotland, and a licence to begin broadcasting to the North East, and expanded the Smooth Network. Along with the Smooth FM stations in London and Manchester, all Saga stations were relaunched under the Smooth Radio brand on 26 March 2007. Saga 105.7 FM in the West Midlands became 105.7 Smooth Radio, Saga 106.6 FM in the East Midlands became 106.6 Smooth Radio and Glasgow based Saga 105.2 FM became 105.2 Smooth Radio. A service for the north east of England, 97.5 Smooth Radio, was launched in January 2008. To begin with, most programming for these stations was produced locally and some shows were networked from London. However, Smooth gradually increased its networked programming until most content was originated in London or Manchester. In March 2008, GMG Radio requested that Ofcom remove the 45 hour jazz commitment for its London and Manchester stations. The company planned to relaunch Jazz FM from the jazzfm.com service which broadcast on DAB in Glasgow, online and on a DAB multiplex in London. In a meeting on 22 April 2008, Ofcom declined the request. GMG relaunched Jazz FM despite having to retain the jazz commitment. The decrease of local output lead to criticism from Norman Quirk, the former managing director of Saga 105.2 FM in Glasgow, after GMG Radio dismissed six Scottish presenters in August 2008 in favour of increased networked content from its stations in London and Manchester. The station had operated a 24 hour schedule of local programming. Quirk labelled the dismissals disgraceful and expressed his fears that the station would not be able to serve the needs and interests of the Scottish people as well as Saga had done. After John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that it wanted to compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast the rest of the time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London. On 1 November 2011, GMG Radio launched Smooth Christmas on the Digital One multiplex, a dedicated station playing only Christmas music with no news or advertisements. It promoted Smooth Radio and broadcast until 27 December 2011. Smooth Christmas was replaced on a trial basis by Smooth 70s, playing tracks from the 1970s. The station was warmly received by listeners, and in January 2012 GMG Radio confirmed a deal with US syndication firm Premiere Networks to air 1970s editions of the American Top 40 show presented by Casey Kasem, which would be broadcast at weekends. Smooth 70s' weekday programming included Disco Lunch and Late Night Love Songs. Due to its popularity, Smooth Christmas was relaunched in November 2012 on the Digital One multiplex alongside Smooth 70s. In June 2012 it was reported that Guardian Media Group was seeking to sell GMG Radio in order to restructure itself to stem losses being made by The Guardian and The Observer newspapers. Several offers were received for the subsidiary, valuing it at 50 million. GMG Radio was sold to Global Radio on 25 June, at an estimated price of between 50 million and 70 million. Global renamed GMG Radio Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. Several rival radio groups expressed their concerns over the takeover and the effect it could have on commercial radio in the UK. The deal prompted speculation about the possible disappearance of the Smooth Radio brand as a result of a possible merger with Global's Gold network, which was aimed at a similar audience. It was announced that in the short term GMG Radio and Global would continue to operate as separate entities while a review of the sale was carried out by Ofcom. On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt instructed Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading OFT to examine Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50 of the UK radio market because of concerns the takeover may not be in the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013. On 21 February 2013, the Competition Commission confirmed it would delay its decision until May, and issued a statement in which it said, The range of possible remedies to be considered in this case is complex and that all possible remedies need to be explored with the parties to the merger and third parties . The Commission published its final report into the acquisition on 21 May, requiring Global to sell radio stations in seven locations. On 14 June, it was reported that Global would appeal against the Commission's decision. A date for the appeal was subsequently scheduled for October. Following the hearing, in November, the Competition Appeal Tribunal rejected Global's appeal, meaning it would have to sell some stations in order to complete the takeover. Global announced in December that it would not appeal the decision, and would instead begin the process of selling the assets as directed by the Commission. Global announced on 12 August 2013 that Real and Smooth would relocate their London and West Midlands offices to Global premises. Smooth Radio's output was relocated to Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October, a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global Radio permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched from 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime. Smooth Radio catered mainly for listeners over the age of 40, a similar audience to that of BBC Radio 2. Official quarterly audience figures collated by Radio Joint Authority Research Limited RAJAR show that the station had an average weekly audience of just over 3 million listeners. Figures for the third quarter of 2010, released in October 2010 showed that collectively, the six regional Smooth stations had a weekly audience of 3 million at the time Smooth became a national broadcaster. John Simons, Group Programme Director for GMG Radio said, The scope for Smooth Radio is huge and we're looking forward to seeing this growth continue as more and more people discover the station across the UK. We firmly believe Smooth has the potential to become the UK's biggest national commercial station and these figures show it's heading in the right direction During the final quarter of 2010 the station's first as a national broadcaster listening figures rose to 3.08 million, which remained unchanged in the first quarter of 2011, although listenership in London increased by 29 , largely because of the arrival of Simon Bates on the breakfast show in January 2011. Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in the final quarter of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter. However, figures rose again through the second half of the year, with 3.26 million in the third quarter of 2013, and 3.38 million in the fourth. When Smooth Radio launched as a national network, GMG launched a hoarding and television advertising campaign featuring eight Smooth Ambassadors listeners chosen to represent the station's zest for life . Each advertisement included a piece of information about one of the ambassadors, and something they were currently doing. The campaign ran throughout October and November 2010. A later campaign featured Simon Bates, whose breakfast show attracted increased listening figures in London in early 2011. The station signed a number of sponsorship deals with advertisers, often for a particular show or for competitions associated with the advertiser. Its first major sponsorship deal was with Honda, which sponsored the drivetime show upon the station's launch. In July 2011 GMG signed a 13 week deal with gaming website Foxy Bingo to sponsor Smooth Radio's afternoon show, and a three month deal with ATS Euromaster to sponsor the drivetime show began in September 2012. Real and Smooth announced a three month deal with Sky Movies to sponsor Smooth's weekend film show, Smooth Radio at the Movies from February 2013. As part of a three month deal with Tetley Tea announced in October 2011, Smooth Radio's logo appeared on Tetley products sold in British supermarkets. In August 2011, GMG announced a deal with the magazine publisher IPC whereby Smooth Radio would sponsor the TV Times Awards. A trip to Kenya was given away in association with the Kenya Tourist Board in the lead up to the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton the winners would stay at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where the royal couple became engaged. High Street retailer Boots UK launched The Feel Good Forum, a health and beauty lifestyle programme that began airing for an eight week run on Real and Smooth from March 2013. The show, presented by Kate Thornton was a collaboration between the broadcaster, Boots and other partners, including the Mumsnet website. Some online content was also produced to supplement the programme. In July 2013, Real and Smooth secured a deal with the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth Games to be the Official Media Partner for its Ticketing Campaign. Presenters on the station include many notable British radio personalities. The breakfast show was hosted by Simon Bates, who joined the network in January 2011. Bates revived The Golden Hour and Our Tune, two popular features from his Radio 1 days. Emma B presented a Sunday afternoon show from March 2011. The actress Tina Hobley became a Sunday morning presenter from October 2013. Others to join the station at that time include Paul Hollins who presented Smooth Radio's Movie Songs and Smooth Soul Sunday, Gary King who hosted a Sunday lunchtime show, and David Andrews with a Soul and Motown show on Sunday evenings. Former LBC 97.3 presenter Anthony Davis joined the station as its Drivetime presenter from January 2014. Mark Goodier hosted a weekday mid morning show from 2007 to 2012. Chris Tarrant was a Saturday morning presenter whose show was networked across several GMG stations in 2008. Also in 2008, Tony Blackburn presented a syndicated weekend breakfast show for Smooth. He left the station in October 2010 to present Pick of the Pops on BBC Radio 2 because the BBC would not allow him to continue working for a rival broadcaster. Andy Peebles was also a presenter with the station, having hosted his Andy Peebles Soul Train from 2004 to 2013, before moving the programme to Gold, another station owned by Global Radio. David Kid Jensen was a weekday presenter from April 2011 to December 2013. In September 2011, Simon Bates presented a week of programmes from South Australia as part of a promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates presented a special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the end of the 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict. From 2010, Smooth and Real Radio were the official broadcaster of the switch on ceremony for the Blackpool Illuminations, the broadcast rights to which it won from BBC Radio 2, which had aired it since 1997. 2010 was the first time the event was broadcast on commercial radio. The annual event was compered by presenters from the two stations at a purposely built arena, and featured a music concert by popular artists. Performers in 2010 included Alesha Dixon, Gabriella Cilmi, The Wanted, Olly Murs, and Robbie Williams, who switched on the lights that year. The 2012 switch on was performed by Greg Rutherford, Luke Campbell and Beth TweddleBritish Olympians who won gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

From 2009 GMG Radio stations, including Smooth Radio, held an annual fundraising day for Help for Heroes, a UK charity which provides help and support to injured British service personnel. The first Help for Heroes Day took place on 10 November 2009, and collectively the stations raised 200,000. The 18 hour special featured Ronan Keating, Simon Cowell, Spandau Ballet and The Soldiers, and Chris Tarrant returned to the network for the event. The second Help for Heroes Day in 2010 raised 350,000, bringing the accumulated total to 750,000. 255,000 was raised for the charity in 2012. During the fundraising event Smooth Radio Starlight Supper , listeners were encouraged to hold dinner parties at which guests donated money to a cancer charity.

"SMS Bangerz is a song by American singer Miley Cyrus featuring Britney Spears for Cyrus' fourth studio album Bangerz 2013 . It was written and produced by Mike Will Made It and Marz, with additional songwriting provided by Cyrus and Sean Garrett. The track incorporates elements of hip hop styles, and is lyrically a celebration of pop culture, beautiful women, strong women . Upon its release SMS Bangerz received generally mixed reviews from music critics some complimented its originality, while others criticized its production and Cyrus' rapping. The album's digital downloads helped the song chart in the United States and the United Kingdom. Cyrus has performed the song on MTV Unplugged and her Bangerz Tour. SMS Bangerz was written by Miley Cyrus, Mike Will Made It, Sean Garrett, and Marz, while production was handled by Mike Will Made It and Marz. Stephen Hybicki and Tim Roberts recorded the track with help from Mike Gaydusek, and Jaycen Joshua mixed it with assistants of Ryan Kaul. Chris Tek O'Ryan handled engineering the song, and it was further mastered by Dave Kutch at the Mastering Palace. The track is the third on Cyrus's fourth album Bangerz, which was released in 2013. SMS Bangerz has been described as 1980s hip hop inspired track . The song lasts for two minutes and 49 seconds. Garrett stated that its concept was inspired by the female rap trio Salt n Pepa, and noted that the final track was like five different things, it's hip hop, it's the girls, it's a female anthem, Salt n Pepa, Britney and Miley . He further opined that the women's collaboration made for a historical moment ... as big as when Britney kissed Madonna Miley said There's only one bitch that I want on my album, and that is Britney bitch . Speculation of a collaboration between Cyrus and Britney Spears first arose after they shared a brief exchange over Twitter in July 2013. The following month, producer Sean Garrett confirmed that the pair had recorded a nuts collaboration for Bangerz. He later stated that Cyrus considered featuring Gwen Stefani or Nicki Minaj as the song's guest vocalist, but felt that the final cut with Spears was absolutely the right one. SMS Bangerz is the third track on Miley Cyrus's fourth studio album Bangerz, which was released in October 2013. Although the song never entered the Billboard Hot 100, the album's strong digital downloads helped it reach number 10 on Billboard's Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, as well as number 157 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is marked as explicit by the RIAA due to its explicit language. Although in October 2013 Cyrus claimed she wanted the song to be the third single off Bangerz, Adore You was the album's third single release instead. Talking about plans for a music video, Cyrus hoped that the video will be as epic as the 'Work Bitch' one, so I think that would be the smartest choice. Upon the album's release, SMS Bangerz received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly provided a favorable review, calling the track one of the best included on Bangerz and describing it as a merry rap off with Britney . Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian opined that Spears' inclusion was a stroke of skewed inspiration , which contributed in making its parent album Cyrus' game changer . Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowle called the song an Auto Tuned Euro house jam that helped make the album both a message of empowerment and a straightforward party album . In contrast, Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club provided a more mixed review, saying that Cyrus absolutely cannot rap, as horrifyingly evidenced by her Kreayshawn like turns highlighted in the track. Evan Sawdey from PopMatters cautioned that braggadocio can only go so far especially with a song that features such a formless sense of melody , and felt that Mike Will Made It has a horrid sense of how hooks work, leaving a slew of missed attempts and mangled opportunities in his wake. An episode of MTV Unplugged starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014 she performed an acoustic version of SMS Bangerz without Spears, among several additional tracks from Bangerz. The song was used as the opening number on the worldwide Bangerz Tour, lasting throughout 2014. Blake Hannon provided a positive review for the performance, praising the synthy rush of the title track. Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people.

"SMS Schwalbe His Majesty's Ship SchwalbeSwallow was an unprotected cruiser built for the German Kaiserliche Marine Imperial Navy , the lead ship of the Schwalbe class. She had one sister ship, Sperber. Schwalbe was built at the Kaiserliche Werft Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven her keel was laid down in April 1886 and her completed hull was launched in August 1887. She was commissioned for service in May 1888. Designed for colonial service, Schwalbe was armed with a main battery of eight 10.5 centimeter 4.1 in guns and had a cruising radius of over 3,000 nautical miles 5,600 km 3,500 mi she also had an auxiliary sailing rig to supplement her steam engines. Schwalbe spent the majority of her career overseas. She served in German East Africa from 1889 to 1893, and during this period she assisted in the suppression of the Abushiri Revolt. In 1893, she returned to Germany for a major overhaul. She was decommissioned until 1898, when she returned to service for another tour abroad. She initially returned to German East Africa, where she patrolled South African waters to protect German shipping during the Second Boer War. The outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 prompted the Kaiserliche Marine to send Schwalbe to join the European forces battling the Boxers. Schwalbe spent 1901 and 1902 in Chinese waters, blockading the mouth of the Yangtze and suppressing local unrest. The ship returned to Germany in 1903 for another major overhaul and another stint in reserve. She ended her career as a barracks ship during World War I, and as a target ship in 1918. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1922. Schwalbe was 66.9 meters 219 ft long overall and had a beam of 9.36 m 30.7 ft and a draft of 4.40 m 14.4 ft forward. She displaced 1,359 t 1,338 long tons at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2 cylinder double expansion steam engines powered by four coal fired cylindrical water tube boilers. These provided a top speed of 13.5 knots 25.0 km h 15.5 mph and a range of approximately 3,290 nautical miles 6,090 km 3,790 mi at 10 knots 19 km h 12 mph . To supplement the steam engines, she was fitted with a barquentine rig. Schwalbe had a crew of 9 officers and 108 enlisted men. The ship was armed with eight 10.5 cm K L 35 guns in single pedestal mounts, supplied with 765 rounds of ammunition in total. They had a range of 8,200 m 26,900 ft . Four guns were mounted on each broadside. The gun armament was rounded out by five 3.7 cm 1.5 in revolver cannon. The keel for Schwalbe was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in April 1886. Her completed hull was launched on 16 August 1887 then Konteradmiral Rear Admiral Alexander von Monts gave the launching speech. She was commissioned for sea trials on 8 May 1888, and they lasted until 8 August. Schwalbe was formally placed into service on 12 November and assigned to the East Africa Station in German East Africa. The assignment came following requests for reinforcement from Konteradmiral Karl August Deinhard, the local commander of naval forces in the region, to help suppress the Abushiri Revolt. She departed Germany eight days later and arrived in Zanzibar on 31 December, and was joined by the aviso Pfeil. The two ships reinforced the old sail corvettes Leipzig and Sophie. On 3 January 1889, Schwalbe bombarded rebel positions at Bagamoyo before taking Deinhard aboard to Dar es Salaam. The next day, she ran aground on the reef surrounding Fungu Yasini Island. The ship remained stranded for two days before Leipzig and the British steamer SS Woodcock arrived to pull her free. She thereafter took her place in a blockade line to prevent contraband from reaching the rebels Schwalbe patrolled the line from Kiswere to Ras Kimbiji. On 1 March, she was moved to the area between Kilwa Kisiwani and Mafia Island. Schwalbe, Leipzig, and the corvette Carola sent a contingent of naval infantry ashore at Kunduchi to attack rebel forces there the three warships also provided artillery support to the landing force. Korvettenkapitan KKCorvette Captain Hirschberg, Schwalbe's captain, commanded the operation. Schwalbe returned to Bagamoyo on 8 May to launch another attack further engagements took place at Saadani on 6 June and at Pangani on 8 July. Schwalbe and her crew were given a respite from the conflict from 20 July to 17 August for a period of rest and refit at Port Louis in Mauritius. On 29 August, Schwalbe returned to the blockade line off German East Africa. During this period, she frequently carried Deinhard on special trips. Between 7 and 10 October, she carried the station commander to survey the colony's northern border with British Kenya in company with the British gunboat HMS Mariner. Schwalbe continued to operate against insurgent forces, particularly to support Reichskommissar Imperial Commissioner Hermann Wissmann's forces. At the end of October, Schwalbe was joined by her sister ship Sperber. In early December, Schwalbe and Sperber were present at ceremonial reception of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition at Bagamoyo. Both ships were also involved with settling the border of Wituland on 2729 December. In mid January 1890, Pfeil, Leipzig, and Sophie left East Africa, leaving Schwalbe, Sperber, and Carola on the station. Schwalbe went to Cape Town in South Africa for an overhaul that lasted from 3 March until mid April. Following her return from Cape Town, Schwalbe returned to supporting operations to pacify the coastal area in southern German East Africa carried out by Wissmann. During this period, several artillery pieces were captured, one of which was taken aboard Schwalbe before eventually being given to the Training Inspection for the colonial troops. By mid May, the uprising had finally been suppressed. Schwalbe thereafter conducted the normal peacetime routine of cruising the coast to show the German flag. Hirschberg contracted malaria and became severely ill, prompting his return to Germany on 24 June to recover KK Rudiger arrived on 13 July to take over command of the ship. On 9 October, Rudiger presided over a ceremony to dedicate a memorial in Tanga to the naval personnel who had been killed in the Abushiri revolt. Meanwhile, on 1 July, Wituland had been ceded to Britain as part of the HeligolandZanzibar Treaty this development upset the Sultan of Wituland, who ordered the killing of several Europeans in the colony, mostly Germans. The British launched a punitive expedition, and Schwalbe remained in the area as an observer until the end of October. In June 1891, Schwalbe went to Mahe in the Seychelles to rest her crew. Rudiger was promoted to the position of Deputy Governor of the colony in October, and KK Oelrichs replaced him aboard the ship. Schwalbe then departed to visit Bombay, returning to German East Africa on 27 January 1892. Unrest in Moshi required Schwalbe's presence to provide support for the Schutztruppen. She was anchored off Tanga by June, and in October, the death of Ali bin Said, the Sultan of Zanzibar, caused a succession crisis that forced Schwalbe and other vessels to steam to the island to help mediate the disputes. By January 1893, Schwalbe was free to return to Bombay for repairs. In May, Schwalbe received the order to return to Germany. She arrived in Kiel on 6 August, and was decommissioned on 25 August. The Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel took the ship into drydock for an extensive overhaul and modernization. She remained out of service after the repair work was completed, until 1 April 1898, when she was recommissioned for another tour in German East Africa, to replace the cruiser Seeadler. On 20 April, Schwalbe left Germany and arrived off Zanzibar a month and a half later, on 7 June. She went to Cape Town for periodic maintenance from 10 October to mid November. In January 1899, she towed the disabled German East Africa Line steamer SS Setos to Dar es Salaam. For this, the Line donated a sum to the Navy, which the Reichsmarineamt Imperial Navy Office used to improve the sailors' barracks. In October, the Second Boer War broke out between British South Africa and the Boer Orange Free State and the Transvaal. Schwalbe and the cruiser Condor were sent to South Africa to protect German shipping, since the British had begun aggressively searching foreign freighters to prevent contraband from reaching the Boers. Despite the presence of the two cruisers, several German ships, including the Imperial post steamers SS Bundesrat and SS General, the freighter SS Hans Wagner, and the barque Marie were seized by the Royal Navy. This caused a major diplomatic incident and led to the passage of the Second Naval Law in Germany. During her patrol of South African waters, she stopped in Durban from 19 to 21 January 1900, Port Elizabeth, East London, Cape Town, and Delagoa Bay. Tensions eased as the Boers began to suffer several defeats in early 1900, and on 7 May, Schwalbe was back in Dar es Salaam. From here, she was ordered to leave for East Asian waters to reinforce the German East Asia Squadron and assist with suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China. She arrived in Chinese waters in late September, and was assigned to the blockade of the mouth of the Yangtze. She spent the period from 14 February to 3 March 1901 in the German concession at Tsingtao, after which she returned to the Yangtze. The blockade of the river ended in June, and on 10 June she returned to Tsingtao. From 4 September to 11 November, she underwent an overhaul in Shanghai. She then returned to Tsingtao and the Yangtze area, before riots in Zhejiang province forced her to steam to Ningpo to assist in suppressing the unrest on 9 April 1902. On 16 April, she left for repairs at Shanghai. On 23 July, while Schwalbe was moored in Tsingtao, she received the order to return to Germany. On 16 August, she departed Tsingtao and arrived in Danzig on 10 December. There, she was decommissioned a second time three days later. Another lengthy overhaul followed, which lasted from 1903 to 1905 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig. Schwalbe remained in reserve following the completion of her overhaul in 1905, until 26 October 1911, when she was recommissioned for use as a special purpose ship. The Navy planned to convert her into a survey ship for use abroad, but in 1912 the Navy instead decided to use her to replace the old aviso Grille as a training ship. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was converted into a barracks ship based in Kiel. She served in this capacity until 1918, when she was used as a target ship outside Kiel. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold for scrapping on 7 August 1920. Schwalbe was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1922 in Hamburg.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS%20Schwalbe
"SMS Sperber His Majesty's Ship SperberSparrowhawk was an unprotected cruiser built for the German Kaiserliche Marine Imperial Navy , the second member of the Schwalbe class. She had one sister ship, Schwalbe. Sperber was built at the Kaiserliche Werft Imperial Dockyard in Danzig her keel was laid down in September 1887 and her completed hull was launched in August 1888.

Sperber spent the majority of her career overseas. She briefly served in German East Africa in late 1889 and early 1890, before being transferred to the South Seas Station in German New Guinea. She remained there for three years before being transferred to German Southwest Africa from early 1894 to late 1896. She was decommissioned in Germany in December 1896 and overhauled before recommissioning for another tour abroad in December 1902. She briefly spent time in the East American Station off Venezuela in early 1903 and East Africa from July to October of that year, before being assigned to the East Asia Squadron by the end of the year. After spending 1904 in Chinese waters, Sperber was reassigned to Southwest Africa, where she remained until 1911. She returned to Germany at the end of the year and was decommissioned a second time, but was thereafter used as a target ship until 1918.

She was thereafter assigned to the South Seas Station in German New Guinea to replace the gunboats Adler and Eber, which had been destroyed by the 1889 Apia cyclone. On 20 August, Sperber was recommissioned for her new assignment, and she departed Kiel on 4 September, bound for the Pacific. While coaling in Aden on 13 October, the cruiser received orders to head to German East Africa, which was gripped by the Abushiri Revolt. There, she was to replace the old sail corvette Leipzig and the aviso Pfeil. Sperber arrived in Zanzibar on 26 October four days earlier, the protectorate of Wituland had been granted to Germany. Sperber's first assignment upon reaching East Africa was to conduct a formal survey of the border between Wituland and British Kenya. Sperber was also to conduct the formal flag raising in the new protectorate. Starting on 1 November, Sperber joined the fight against the rebels. In early December, Sperber and her sister ship Schwalbe were present at ceremonial reception of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition at Bagamoyo. Both ships were also involved with settling the border of Wituland on 2729 December. In mid January 1890, Pfeil, Leipzig, and Sophie left East Africa, leaving Schwalbe, Sperber, and Carola on the station. On 22 April, Sperber was finally released to resume her original assignment to the South Seas Station. She met Alexandrine in Australia and visited the ports of Melbourne and Sydney, where she underwent an overhaul. Sperber finally arrived in Apia in German Samoa on 30 July. She thereafter took Friedrich Biermann, the Imperial Commissioner for the Marshall Islands, on a tour of the islands. The cruiser returned to Apia on 5 October. In January 1891, Sperber's commander presided over the unveiling of a monument to the German sailors who had been killed at the Battle of Vailele in December 1888. The cruiser then departed for Sydney for another overhaul, which lasted from 24 January to 21 March. After the repair work was completed, Sperber went on a tour of Germany's colonies in the Pacific, including the Bismarck Archipelago, the Marshalls, and Butaritari. She was back in Apia by 6 June, where she remained stationed until 15 December. The new unprotected cruiser Bussard joined her there on 13 December. In February 1892, Sperber left for another overhaul in Sydney. While en route, she had to stop at Tabiteuea in the Gilbert Islands and send a landing party ashore to punish locals who had attacked German businessmen there. The overhaul lasted from 3 March to 3 May, after which Sperber went on another tour of the islands, including the Marshalls, Butaritari, and Matupit Island. At Matupit the Deputy Chancellor, Georg Schmiele, came aboard the ship. Sperber was back in Apia by 17 May, and she remained there until 1 November, when she left for another tour, which included stops at Nukufetau, Herbertshohethe capital of German New Guineaand Friedrich Wilhelmshafen. Another period of dockyard work at Sydney followed from 6 February 1893 to 18 April. In the meanwhile, unrest in Samoa broke out, under the leadership of King Mata'afa Iosefo. He was arrested, however, which caused the movement to disperse after she returned from Sydney, Sperber was tasked with taking Mata'afa into exile on Jaluit Atoll. The unprotected cruiser Falke, which had been assigned to German Southwest Africa, was ordered to replace Sperber in November 1893. Sperber was in turn ordered to return to Germany, and she departed the South Seas Station on 6 November. While en route, however, her orders were changed and she was instead sent to Southwest Africa. She stopped in Cape Town, South Africa for an overhaul, and finally arrived in Kamerun on 28 May 1894. Her shallower draft, compared to her predecessor Falke, permitted her to routinely cross the sandbar in the mouth of the Kamerun River. At this time, the only other German warship on the station was the gunboat Hyane, though the government steamer Nachtigal and the hulked gunboat Cyclop were also available in the colony. Sperber was thereafter responsible for conducting patrols of the colony. She visited Cape Town on 10 November 1895, and while on her way there, she carried a granite copy of the padrao that had been placed there by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cao in the late 15th century. The original stone monument had been transported back to Berlin for preservation in 1893 by Falke. A short period of dockyard maintenance lasted from 17 to 29 February 1896. On 6 March, she was sent to Swakopmund in response to an uprising by the local population. She send a landing party ashore to help the Schutztruppen Protection force secure the city. From 23 March to 9 April, Sperber went to Mossamedes for a period of rest for her crew. On 22 September, she departed Southwest Africa and headed for Germany she arrived in Kiel on 18 November and was decommissioned on 7 December. Starting in early 1898, Sperber was taken into drydock for a major overhaul. The work lasted until August, and she was placed back in reserve once it was completed. On 16 December 1902, the ship was again commissioned for service abroad, this time to reinforce the East American Station in Central and South America. She left Kiel on 5 January 1903 and arrived in Willemstad in Curacao. The Venezuela Crisis of 190203 was by that time winding down, and so apart from visits to a few Venezuelan ports, her presence was unnecessary. Instead, she was ordered to German East Africa in late February. Sperber left the East American Station on 22 March and steamed through the Mediterranean Sea, arriving in Dar es Salaam on 1 July. She was there only briefly, before she was again transferred, this time to the East Asia Squadron on 9 October. She arrived in Singapore on 23 November and continued on to the mouth of the Yangtze in China, where she was stationed at the time. From there, she went to Shanghai on 15 May 1904, and visited several Chinese ports, followed by an overhaul from August to December in Germany's concession at Tsingtao. In early 1905, Sperber visited ports in southern China, where she received orders to return to Southwest Africa. She went Tsingtao on 24 April before departing for Africa, arriving in Douala on 26 July. There, she met the gunboat Habicht. On 27 January 1907, Sperber was present in Lome for the opening of the first railroad line in German Togoland. Between 1908 and 1909, she conducted an extensive survey of the west African coast. In February 1909, she visited the ruins of Gro Friedrichsburg, the old capital of the Brandenburger Gold Coast, a colony founded by Frederick William I of Prussia in the 17th century. She thereafter returned to survey work in Kamerun and Southwest Africa. On 6 March 1910, she was transferred to German East Africa to replace Bussard. While en route, her crew helped to put out a major fire in Luderitz Bay on 15 April. After arriving in East Africa, Sperber conducted the normal routine of visiting ports in the colony. She went to Cape Town for an overhaul from 26 October to 3 December. On 6 March 1911, she received orders to return to Germany for a second time. She arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 29 June, and was decommissioned again on 6 July. She was stricken from the naval register on 16 March 1912 and was thereafter used as a target ship until 1918. She was sold on 7 August 1920 and broken up for scrap in Hamburg in 1922.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS%20Sperber
"Jan Christian Smuts aka Jan Christiaan Smuts , OM, CH, ED, KC, FRS 24 May 187011 September 1950 was a prominent South African and Commonwealth statesman, military leader, and philosopher. He served as a Boer General during the Boer War, a British General during the First World War and was appointed Field Marshal by King George VI during the Second World War. In addition to various cabinet appointments, he served as Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa from 1919 until 1924 and from 1939 until 1948. From 1917 to 1919 he was one of five members of the British War Cabinet, helping to create the Royal Air Force. He played a leading part in the post war settlements at the end of both world wars, making significant contributions towards the creation of the League of Nations and the United Nations. He did much to redefine the relationship between Britain and the Dominions and Colonies, leading to the formation of the British Commonwealth. Jan Smuts was born in 1870, the second son of a traditional Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son would be the only child to receive a full formal education however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12 year old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright future in the United Kingdom, the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa. On 24 May 1870, at the Smuts family farm, Bovenplaats, in the district of Malmesbury, Cape Colony, a child was born to Jacobus Smuts and his wife Catharina. This child, their second son in what was to become a family of four sons and two daughters, was christened Jan Christiaan after his maternal grandfather, Jan Christiaan de Vries The Smuts family were prosperous yeoman farmers, long established in the area. For four generations, since 1786, they had farmed in the Malmesbury district, settling on the farm Ongegund, of which Bovenplaats was a part, in 1818. This area was part of the so called Swartland, the chief wheat growing area of the Cape Colony. 1870 found Bovenplaats under the care of Jacobus Abraham Smuts and his wife Catharina Petronella. Jacobus Smuts lived in much the same manner as his forefathers a hard working farmer, a pillar of the Church, and one who took a leading part in the social and political affairs of the neighbourhood. Such was the regard in which he was held that he was later to be elected as the Member for Malmesbury in the Cape Parliament. Smuts's mother, born Catharina Petronella de Vries, was the sister of Boudewijn Homburg de Vries, the predikant of the nearby town of Riebeek West, some three miles 5 km from Bovenplaats. The de Vries family originated from the area around Worcester, Cape Colony. Catharina accompanied her brother as his housekeeper when he took up his appointment at Riebeek West, eventually meeting and marrying her husband in 1866. She was a woman of considerable education and culture, at least according to the standards of the area, having studied music and French in Cape Town. When Jan was six years of age the family moved from Bovenplaats to a new farm some thirteen miles 19 km away. This farm, Klipfontein, was a bequest to Jacobus Smuts, who, keen to have a farm of his own rather than one under the supervision of his father, moved his family there in 1876. The Smuts family were traditional Afrikaner farmers. As such, questions of property and family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom dictated that it was upon the first son that family expectations fell the family would strive, so far as their means allowed, to provide him with the best possible education with the goal of paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm, while at the same time receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church. Farmwork combined with lessons from his mother such was the order of Jan's life for the next few years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race. In this relatively liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, listening to their stories, learning the ways of the countryside, and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began to go out into the countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock. At home, away from the work of the farm, his education was not neglected. Although restricted to rudimentary home schooling, his mother's own notable education placed him and his siblings at an advantage compared with other children in similar circumstances. The Smuts family lived in an almost exclusively Afrikaner world. Nevertheless, this cultural identity, unlike that of the Boer republics to the north, did not define itself on opposition to Britain or the British. Swartland farmers had been largely insulated from the causes of discontent of earlier years, discontent which eventually culminated in the mass Boer migrations of the Great Trek. As a result, Jacobus Smuts largely unmoved by the Afrikaner nationalism preached by such organisations as the Afrikaner Bond, founded by Rev. SJ du Toit in 1877. After 1884, having come under the leadership of Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, the Bond became more to the Smuts' taste. Hofmeyr changed the fundamental basis of the organisation, from one preaching Afrikaner separatism to one which combined a pragmatic policy of economic protectionism for Cape farmers and their produce with a call for unity between the English and Dutch speaking populations and cooperation with the Colonial authorities. As a member of the Cape legislature Jacobus Smuts pledged his support to Hofmeyr and the reformed Bond. Unlike many parts of South Africa, conflict was an element largely absent from Jan Smuts's early life. Whether conflict between Briton and Boer, or conflict between Black and White it had been many years since the farmers of the Swartland had had to deal with turmoil on their doorsteps. The absence of conflict, along with its inevitable counterpart, development of prejudice, had its effect upon Smuts. In later years Smuts was to look upon this time with the uttermost fondness. Of all his childhood experiences it was the time spent out on the veld, whether tending the cattle or out on excursions of his own, which seemed to have the most marked effects on him, developing an attachment which was almost spiritual in nature. As he wrote in 1902, aged 32 In ordinary circumstances Jan Smuts would have, in time, taken over the running of the family farm, spending his life as a farmer as his father, grandfather, and great grandfather had before him. However this was not to be events were to conspire to change this predetermined fate. In 1882 tragedy struck the Smuts family. Their eldest son, Michiel, suddenly succumbed to typhoid while attending school at Riebeek West. This time of family grief and upheaval had a direct effect upon Jan now, as the eldest son, the weight of family expectation fell squarely upon his shoulders. Within weeks Jan was sent from the familiar surroundings of Klipfontein to a boarding house at Riebeek West, to take his brother's place at the school of Mr TC Stoffberg. As had been the case with his brother, his parents had already mapped out his future like his brother Jan was destined for a future in the Dutch Reformed Church, to be ordained as a predikant at the conclusion of his studies. This vocation, though imposed upon him by his parents, was by no means regarded as an imposition by Jan, growing up as he had in an environment where adherence to the Church and piety of deeds counted for a good deal. This upbringing had turned twelve year old Jan into a deeply religious, serious minded boy. Now, attending school for the first time, he faced a number of obstacles. Foremost amongst these was his rudimentary grasp of English, at a time when it was the main medium of instruction and crucial for any Afrikaner who wished to play a role in wider Cape society. Thanks to his mother's efforts. in this as well as in other subjects, he was better prepared than most children in similar circumstances, but nevertheless he was to start his schooling alongside children many years younger than himself with many years of study separating him from his contemporaries. Even so, despite these disadvantages, Jan proved himself an outstanding scholar. He surpassed the other children both in terms of innate ability and in terms of dedication to his work. It was not for nothing that his headmaster, Mr Stoffberg, described him as one of the most brilliant pupils he had ever taught, and the most hard working boy he had ever met. Within three years Jan had made sufficient progress to have caught up with his age group, children with up to ten years of formal education behind them. He compounded this remarkable achievement when the time came for him to sit the Cape Colony elementary examination in 1885 Jan was placed ninth in the entire colony. The next year he surpassed even this, coming second in the School Higher examination. During these few years at Riebeek West Jan worked assiduously at his studies self evidently, given his achievements. His academic abilities were soon noted by his headmaster, who went out of his way to provide Jan with further curricular reading. Yet this was to prove insufficient to meet what was becoming an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge. Jan borrowed books and yet more books from the headmaster, poring over them at all times rather than engaging in the childish pursuits of the other children, separated from them by his strong work ethic. A few weeks before the School Higher examination this had its consequences Jan fell ill, an illness exacerbated by his unremitting study. With a strict injunction from his doctor, ordering a complete rest with an absolute prohibition on work and reading, Jan was packed off to bed. Nevertheless, despite the doctor's orders, Jan went to strenuous lengths to evade the ban. One story told of him during this enforced convalescence describes how he used to involve the headmaster's youngest son in his subterfuges, bribing the four year old child to bring him books from his father's study. This enjoyed considerable success until the day of an unannounced visit from the headmaster's wife. In his sparsely furnished room there were few possibilities, but Jan made the best job that he could of concealing his by now substantial collection of books. The headmaster's wife upon entering the room found Jan, as expected, in bed. However the boy did not look to be comfortably resting as he ought, in fact he looked positively uncomfortable. She offered to make Jan's bed for him, he declined, insisting that he was perfectly comfortable she insisted and, being the headmaster's wife, got her way. Embarking upon her deed of kindness she found, to her astonishment, the real reason for Jan's restlessness underneath his bedclothes he was making a valiant effort to conceal an immense pile of contraband books This dedication to reading and study might, in another boy, have been nothing more than a reaction to the impending examinations but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its own sake. In 1886, at the age of sixteen, Jan embarked on the next stage of his education. Jan applied to, and was accepted by, Victoria College, Stellenbosch one of the most prominent institutes of higher education in the Cape. In late 1886 he bade farewell to Riebeek West, ready to embark upon a new stage in life. Mr Stoffberg's school did not take its pupils to the final stage of secondary education. Before Jan could set his schooldays behind him and commence his higher education he would have to sit the Matriculation exam. Jan duly moved from Riebeek West to Stellenbosch, spending early 1886 to late 1886 preparing for this test. At Riebeeck West Jan had been a hard working, deeply religious child, with a strongly reserved, almost solitary, nature. This disposition, a legacy of his pious, rural upbringing, is manifest in what is his earliest surviving letter. This letter, written to Professor C Murray, a tutor at Victoria College, was for the most part a run of the mill enquiry into the administrative arrangements for the forthcoming term. Yet in amongst this mundane request for information on such matters as textbooks and school fees Jan found himself confiding his innermost motive forces to this stranger. As he wrote To avoid temptation and to make the proper use of my precious time, I purposely refuse to enter a public boarding department, as that of Mr de Kock, but shall board privately most likely at Mr N. Ackermann's which will, in addition, accord with my private and reserved nature. In the event, Smuts's resolution to make the proper use of my precious time overcame such moral and religious temptations as a small town like Stellenbosch was capable of providing. Religion and his studies these remained unchallenged as the twin poles of his existence during his matriculation year. In the seclusion of Mr Ackermann's boarding house Jan studied assiduously, attended Church with zeal, and ignored the blandishments of the puerile element . The Matriculation exam tested candidates on five subjects Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, with the highest marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding a misunderstanding at the start of the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a years study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree. Without doubt Smuts's determined work ethic played a central role in these successes, yet he was also aided in no small part by his formidable memory. At that age Jan found himself able to memorise large portions of book simply by reading through them, and though this ability gradually diminished as the years passed, it never entirely disappeared. As his son was later to recount With the hurdle of Matriculation behind him the start of the 1887 term finally saw Smuts admitted as a student of Victoria College and enrolled as an undergraduate of the University of the Cape of Good Hope. Victoria College proved fertile grounds for Smuts's imagination. As his biographer WK Hancock was to write Smuts thrived in this environment. With these new vistas of knowledge and learning now revealed that he spared no effort in his attempts to master them. His surviving notebooks from this period reveal the range and breadth of his studies Latin, Greek, German, the Classics, Optical Physics, Inorganic Chemistry and Metallurgy, Organic Chemistry and Agriculture, and Geology to name but a few. Once again, as had been the case at Riebeek West, this was not merely study for the sake of exams as ever, Smuts continued to study avidly outside the confines of the curriculum. Over the next few years at Victoria College, Smuts's religion continued to be of crucial importance. On Sundays he would attend both morning and evening church services, also leading a Bible study class for local Coloured boys, and during the week he was an assiduous attendee at evening prayer meetings. Within Victoria College, one of the strongest friendships he formed was with Professor JI Marais, the head of the Theology faculty. Smuts's religious observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings and who was destined for a future in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start to move away from the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within which he had been raised. If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's intellectual awakening, it also was where he came to mature socially. Here he began to cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming a regular contributor to the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the political and social issues facing South Africa. Though Smuts did much to cast off his shyness and reserve, he made few hard and fast friendships at Stellenbosch. Yet it was here that he met the woman who was to play a central role in his life thereafter. Sybella Margaretha Krige, known to all as Isie, was the daughter of Japie Krige, a prominent local wine and dairy farmer. Six months younger than Smuts, she had shared a similar upbringing with much the same resulting character traits. As their son, also name Jan Christian, was later to write Isie was an intelligent young woman who, like Smuts, had scored highly in her Matriculation exam. It was thought, as a girl, a future in higher education was largely closed to her. The time spent in her company, whether reading poetry and singing together at the piano, or walking together in the mornings and evenings on the journey to and from Victoria College, did much to break down Smuts's social isolation, enabling him to cast some of those protective prejudices which he had harboured of the puerile element , that is to say his peers. As he wrote in his diary some years later , less idealistic than I, but more human, recalled me from my intellectual isolation and made me return to my fellows. In 1888 Cecil Rhodes paid a visit to Victoria College. As the leader of the College debating society, Smuts was called upon to deliver the welcoming address on behalf of the student body. Rhodes, on the verge of becoming Prime Minister of Cape Colony, was a vocal advocate of Southern African political and economic unity. Now, on the occasion of this visit, Smuts chose to give his address on the theme of Pan Africanism. Smuts's engagement with politics was very much a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes. Two essays written during this time foreshadow Smuts's later views, both political and philosophical. The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, an examination of the economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving only modest success, it is unsurpassed as a clear and authoritative statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time. Within the essay Smuts considered the vexed question of the political and economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa. Though close in terms of geographical proximity, their troubled relations over the preceding quarter century had done much to create an atmosphere of political estrangement. Smuts considered that this estrangement had come about largely as the result of petty jealousies, fostered by politicians interested more in their own parochial concerns than those of South Africa as a whole. And it was to South Africa as a whole that Smuts looked he did not take the side of one colony or state over the others, but rather treated the region as one single unity. In his own words he summed this up A call for unity was his emotional response to the question. Coming down to earth, he proposed two concrete policies as steps towards its ultimate realisation expansion of a pan South African railway system, fostering greater commercial links and binding the region together, combined with the elimination of all regional tariffs and trade barriers with the formation of a South African customs union. The writing of this essay was an important formative experience for Smuts. For the first time he had seriously grappled with questions of contemporary politics, and in doing so came to comprehend something of his own political role in resolving them. As he was to write Seminal though this moment was, it was just a start. As his biographer, WK Hancock, noted All the same, knew that nations are not made by administrative arrangements alone . In The Conditions of Future South African Literature, his next essay of significance, he dealt with the other significant factor in nation building the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community. Within this essay, not at first sight written on an overtly political topic, Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born. The question then arose what was hindering this development Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population. The relations between these two groups were fraught the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population. With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant economic unit of South Africa, but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest, with the established population decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers. These divisions, though strongest in the Transvaal, existed to one degree or another throughout South Africa. Smuts, though sympathising with the concerns of the old population, fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration, urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting. Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old, to consolidate the white population both for the sake of a future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population. In later years Smuts summed up this period In the examinations of 1891, Smuts took a double First in Literature and Science. He applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. On 23 September 1891 he departed the Cape, on board the ship Roslyn Castle, bound for the United Kingdom and a place at Cambridge University. Smuts was admitted to Christ's College, where he elected to study Law. The choice of Law marked the start of a new chapter for Smuts. The preceding years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had not as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion. During his time at Cambridge Smuts maintained a regular correspondence with his old friend and tutor Professor Marais. Smuts's choice of Law gave rise to a lively discussion between the two, with Marais regretting Smuts's choice, declaring Law to be 'simply classified humbug' and accusing 'those who pore over legal tomes' of having a 'contracted view of life'. In response Smuts published an essay in Christ's College Magazine in defence of Law. Entitled 'Law A Liberal Study', it attempted to rebut these criticisms, declaring that from Moses onwards lawyers had been the 'great lights and ornaments of the Church' and identifying within Law '...as it develops through the ages of human history, ...the deepest, truest, most permanent thought and social achievement of progressive humanity.' Aside from friendship on this intellectual level, Marais was also able to come to Smuts's rescue at a time of awkward crisis. Smuts came to Cambridge at the age of twenty one, three or more years older than the typical university undergraduate. He was isolated from the other men of his year by a different social background, different upbringing, and different attitudes. Smuts's disdain for frivolity and laxity combined with his lack of interest in sports and his decision to take up lodgings outside the college, did much to divide him from the other students. During his first year at Cambridge, Smuts suffered from tremendous homesickness, describing himself as being 'utterly desolate'. Yet during this time Smuts had not found himself without social opportunities as his biographer WK Hancock wrote This could of course have simply been a case of Smuts's diffidence and reserve re asserting itself in the face of new and unfamiliar surrounding however Smuts's biographers almost universally ascribe it to the poverty Smuts endured during this first year. The Ebden scholarship was usually worth 200 per year. However, in 1891, due to a failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only 100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources and his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for 50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover. With Marais's loans combined with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent he was at least able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships. In respect of his studies, he achieved the unique distinction of sitting both parts of the Law Tripos in the same year, passing both with first class honours. Over the course of his studies at Cambridge Smuts won many academic awards and accolades, culminating, in 1893, with the award of the prestigious George Long prize in Roman Law and Jurisprudence a particular honour given that the prize was very rarely awarded as the rigorous academic standard required was very rarely met. This was all combined with extensive extracurricular reading and private research into various topics including poetry, philosophy, botany, and archaeology. As his biographer WK Hancock wrote Smuts's time at Cambridge had been one of outstanding success his tutor Professor FW Maitland, himself one of the most eminent legal minds of the time, described Smuts as the most brilliant Law student he had ever taught. With testimonials such as this, in summer 1894 Smuts was able to persuade the Ebden trustees to award him 100 for a further year's study. After a short holiday in Strasbourg, spent studying English conveyancing and German philosophy, Smuts returned to England. For a short time he contemplated moving to the Netherlands to seek a Dutch degree, but by October 1894 he had instead decided to read for the Bar. In December 1894 he passed the Honours Examination of the Inns of Court, passing first in his year. Smuts was called to the Middle Temple and soon received an offer of a fellowship in Law from his old college, Christ's. The possibility of a distinguished legal career in England, whether in practice or in academia, now lay before him. Instead, he rejected both paths in June 1895, as his Ebden funding came to an end, the homesick Smuts returned to the Cape, determined to make his future there.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early%20life%20of%20Jan%20Smuts
"Smyshlyony Russian , lit. 'Clever' was one of 18 Storozhevoy class destroyer officially known as Project 7U built for the Soviet Navy during the late 1930s. Although she began construction as a Project 7 Gnevny class destroyer, Smyshlyony was completed in 1940 to the modified Project 7U design. Assigned to the Black Sea Fleet, she covered the evacuation of the Danube Flotilla to Odessa a few weeks after the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June. During the Sieges of Odessa and Sevastopol in 19411942, the ship ferried reinforcements and supplies into those cities, evacuated wounded and refugees and bombarded Axis troop positions. Smyshlyony struck a Soviet mine on 6 March 1942 and sank the following day as the flooding could not be contained. All but two of her crew perished when she sank. Originally built as a Gnevny class ship, Smyshlyony and her sister ships were completed to the modified Project 7U design after Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, ordered that the latter be built with their boilers arranged en echelon, instead of linked as in the Gnevnys, so that a ship could still move with one or two boilers disabled. Like the Gnevnys, the Project 7U destroyers had an overall length of 112.5 meters 369 ft 1 in and a beam of 10.2 meters 33 ft 6 in , but they had a reduced draft of 3.98 meters 13 ft 1 in at deep load. The ships were slightly overweight, displacing 1,727 metric tons 1,700 long tons at standard load and 2,279 metric tons 2,243 long tons at deep load. The crew complement of the Storozhevoy class numbered 207 in peacetime, but this increased to 271 in wartime, as more personnel were needed to operate additional equipment. Each ship had a pair of geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller, rated to produce 54,000 shaft horsepower 40,000 kW using steam from four water tube boilers, which the designers expected would exceed the 37 knot 69 km h 43 mph speed of the Project 7s because there was additional steam available. Some fell short of it, although specific figures for most individual ships have not survived. Variations in fuel oil capacity meant that the range of the Project 7Us varied between 1,380 to 2,700 nautical miles 2,560 to 5,000 km 1,590 to 3,110 mi at 19 knots 35 km h 22 mph , that upper figure demonstrated by Storozhevoy. The Project 7U class ships mounted four 130 millimeter 5.1 in B 13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of the superstructure. Anti aircraft AA defense was provided by a pair of 76.2 millimeter 3 in 34 K AA guns in single mounts and three 45 millimeter 1.8 in 21 K AA guns, as well as four 12.7 millimeter 0.5 in DK or DShK machine guns. They carried six 533 mm 21 in torpedo tubes in two rotating triple mounts amidships. The ships could also carry a maximum of 58 to 96 mines and 30 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Mars hydrophones for anti submarine work, although these were useless at speeds over 3 knots 5.6 km h 3.5 mph . Smyshlyony was laid down in Shipyard No. 200 named after 61 Communards in Nikolayev as yard number 1077 on 15 October 1936 as a Gnevny class destroyer with the name Polezny. She was relaid down as a Project 7U destroyer on 27 June 1938, and launched on 26 August 1939. The ship was renamed Smyshlyony on 25 September 1940 and was accepted by the navy on 10 November, but the Soviet naval jack was not raised aboard her until 12 April 1941, after the completion of additional work. She participated in joint maneuvers of the Black Sea Fleet and the Odessa Military District between 15 and 20 June along with other destroyers of the 3rd Division. Following the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, the fleet sortied to lay defensive minefields off its base in Sevastopol on the morning of 23 June. That evening, Smyshlyony and the destroyer Besposhchadny, commanded by the leader of the 3rd Destroyer Division, Kharkov sailed to the Danube estuary to support the river monitors of the Danube Flotilla in response to a report of Romanian destroyers leaving the port of Constanta. The destroyers bombarded Romanian troops around Snake Island, supported several amphibious operations and laid and swept mines before returning to Sevastopol on 25 June, without engaging Romanian surface forces. In the first weeks of the war, the Black Sea Fleet was tasked with disrupting Axis supply lines by bombarding Constanta and its oil tanks. The time of the bombardment was set for 05 00 on 26 June, to be preceded by a 30 minute airstrike by aircraft of the fleet beginning an hour earlier. For the raid, the heavy cruiser Voroshilov and Moskva were to cover the bombardment of the port by the latter's sister ship Kharkov, Smyshlyony and her sister Soobrazitelny. To prevent Axis air attack, the ships began to depart Sevastopol at night, at 18 00 on 25 June. However, before exiting the bay, the ships were ordered back to port because the plan was changed by the People's Commissar for the Navy, Vitse admiral Vice Admiral Nikolay Kuznetsov, who ordered that the two destroyer leaders conduct the bombardment, with the other ships in support. As Smyshlyony steamed out of Sevastopol later that night, one of her paravanes got caught on the seabed, which slowed her down and prevented her from participating in the mission. When the other ships were returning, Smyshlyony rendezvoused with Voroshilov on the next morning and helped to escort the damaged Kharkov back to Sevastopol, putting up anti aircraft fire against German aircraft. In the first half of July, Smyshlyony escorted tankers and other merchant ships to Batumi before returning to Sevastopol for the installation of an LFTI degaussing system. The ship supported the defenders of Odessa from 19 August by ferrying troops and supplies and by bombarding Axis troops. She fired 88 shells, silencing a Romanian battery, on 27 August, and on 30 August conducted eight bombardments. After escorting the damaged leader Tashkent back to Sevastopol on 1 September, then escorted three transports from Odessa to Novorossiysk beginning on the next day. Returning to Odessa, Smyshlyony continued to provide fire support, and, during the evacuation of the port in mid October, she laid a minefield off Ilyichevka in conjunction with the destroyer Bodry on 14 October. The destroyer provided fire support the next day and was one of the last ships to leave the port on 16 October, escorting transports and putting up anti aircraft fire against German aircraft on the voyage back to Sevastopol. The following month, Smyshlyony began escorting supply and troop convoys to and from encircled Sevastopol and attacked Axis troops with her main guns. She escorted the tanker Emba, towing a floating dock for an evacuated repair base, from Sevastopol to Poti between 10 and 15 November. Storms on this voyage repeatedly snapped the tow cables, forcing the destroyer to take the dock in tow herself. She began shelling Axis troops near Sevastopol on 23 November and on 28 November stood off Cape Fiolent, escorting the battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna as the latter conducted a bombardment, to which Smyshlyony added 120 shells. Between 28 November and the end of the year, the ship fired almost a thousand shells. After undergoing scheduled preventative maintenance at Tuapse in December, she returned to Sevastopol with reinforcements and bombarded Axis forces, expending more than 800 shells between 22 and 31 December. On 2830 December, she covered the amphibious landings at Kerch and Feodosia. Smyshlyony escorted two cargo ships, carrying troops and supplies, from Novorossiysk to Sevastopol beginning on the night of 31 December1 January 1942 together with the light cruiser Molotov and Tashkent. At Sevastopol, she fired 56 shells from Severnaya Bay at advancing Axis troops. On the evening of New Year's Day, the destroyer departed for Tuapse, then returned on 3 January as an escort for a transport. Arriving at Sevastopol, Smyshlyony fired about 120 shells and returned to Novorossiysk under the cover of darkness. She turned around and returned to Sevastopol with a company of soldiers on board. On 6 January, the ship attempted to land a reinforcing naval infantry battalion at Eupatoria during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, but was driven off by heavy German fire and bad weather, returning to Sevastopol. She bombarded German positions at Eupatoria on 16 January as a diversion for a small amphibious landing at Sudak, returning to Tuapse. During a storm on 22 January, the destroyer was slightly damaged by the severed anchor chain of Molotov while anchored, but repairs took her out of action for a month. Returning to combat, Smyshlyony bombarded a German battery near Feodosia and reported its silencing on the night of 2021 February, while Molotov and Soobrazitelny fired at other targets. That morning, a storm caused minor damage to her hull, displaying the weak hulls of her class. The destroyer spent nearly a week at sea in late February and early March, bombarding Axis troops near Feodosia and supporting a diversionary assault at Alushta on 2728 February and 2 and 4 March during a Soviet offensive on the Kerch Peninsula. On her return to Novorossiysk, the destroyer put up anti aircraft fire against Heinkel He 111s. After escorting a reinforcement convoy to Kerch on 5 March, the ship accidentally entered a Soviet minefield near Zhelezny Rog en route to Novorossiysk on 6 March. She struck a mine that flooded two boiler rooms and knocked out her power, but jury rigged repairs allowed her to proceed homewards at a speed of eight knots 15 km h 9.2 mph , together with Tashkent and Kharkov. Unrepaired leaks gradually flooded her second and third boiler rooms and she lost power again. Stormy weather foiled attempts to tow her back by Kharkov and she gradually sank stern first at 4443N 3645E 44.717N 36.750E 44.717 36.750Coordinates 4443N 3645E 44.717N 36.750E 44.717 36.750 on 7 March. As the destroyer sank, her depth charges detonated, creating a shockwave that killed almost all of the crew only two survivors were rescued. Her captain was among those killed. She was struck from the Soviet Navy on 2 May.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%20destroyer%20Smyshlyony%20%281940%29
"Charles Henry Smyth Jr. sma March 31, 1866 April 4, 1937 was an American geologist. Born to a prominent family in Upstate New York, he studied geology at Columbia University before becoming a professor of geology at Hamilton College and Princeton University. At Princeton he strengthened the Department of Geology's graduate program. Smyth specialized in petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. He showed the sedimentary origin of iron ore deposits near his native Clinton, New York, mapped the geology of the western Adirondack Mountains, and published a well known monograph on the origins of alkaline igneous rocks. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America. Smyth was born March 31, 1866, in Oswego, New York, the second son of Alice DeWolf Smyth and Charles Henry Smyth Sr. In 1873, he moved with his family to nearby Clinton, New York. His mother belonged to a well known Oswego banking and manufacturing family. His father was a prominent local businessman, holding executive positions at the Franklin Iron Works, Clinton Bank, and the company that managed the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge. He also served on the vestry of the local Episcopal church and was a brigadier general in the New York Guard. The family was considered among the local elite in Clinton. Katharine Blunt was a first cousin. On July 30, 1891, the younger Charles Smyth married Ruth Anne Phelps, originally of Shreveport, Louisiana. They had two children, Charles Phelps Smyth 18951990 and Henry DeWolf Smyth 18981986 . Both became professors of science at Princeton University. Smyth studied at Clinton Grammar School in his youth. He became interested in geology at a young age his native region of Upstate New York had many fossils, and his family's business involved extracting the local iron ore. In 1884, he entered Hamilton College in Clinton, where he studied science. After a year he transferred to the School of Mines at Columbia University. At Columbia he was president of the Glee Club. He graduated in 1888 as one of the top three students in his class. Smyth continued his studies at Cornell University under James Furman Kemp and Harvard University under Nathaniel Shaler. He also worked as an analytical chemist at the Franklin Iron Works, his father's company. He earned his Ph.D. in geology from Columbia in 1890, writing a dissertation titled The Origin of the Clinton Type of Iron Ore . He then spent an additional year studying petrology at Heidelberg University under Harry Rosenbusch, the world expert in the field. In 1891 Smyth returned to Hamilton College to become the Stone Professor of Natural History. In addition to his teaching duties at Hamilton, Smyth spent each summer from 1892 to 1903 doing field work for the New York State Museum in the western Adirondack Mountains, which had been studied very little in the fifty years prior. He collaborated with his old advisor Kemp, who specialized in the eastern Adirondacks, and Henry Platt Cushing, who claimed the northern and northeastern sections. He returned to field work a final time in 1908 ill health prevented further expeditions. In 1905 Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, convinced Smyth to join the Princeton faculty, where Smyth remained until retiring in 1934. He strengthened the graduate program in the Department of Geology, which awarded only two advanced degrees before 1912 during his 29 years, another 31 degrees were awarded. Among his students were Arthur Francis Buddington and Albert Orion Hayes. His courses in petrology and chemical geology introduced students to subjects that were relatively new in the United States. Smyth was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America. He was also a member of the Society of Economic Geologists, the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, the Washington Academy of Sciences, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. Smyth's research was in the subfields of petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. When he began his research most American geologists who used chemistry were mineralogists, volcanologists, or specialists in ore. Smyth was a pioneer in chemical petrology, applying chemistry to ordinary rocks, in the United States. In his dissertation he argued that the iron ore near Clinton was a primary sediment at the time the deposits were believed to be secondary nodules formed by replacement of primary limestone. His Princeton graduate student Hayes proved a similar result about the iron ores of his native Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1919, Smyth showed that a green mineral in the Clinton ores was chamosite and also a primary sediment. Smyth, Kemp, and Cushing's field work in the Adirondacks yielded detailed geologic maps of the challenging region. Smyth described the nature and origins of the area's rocks and mineral deposits. His conclusions were still largely accepted at the time of his death in 1937. His two best known contributions were his work on the Clinton iron ore and a 1927 monograph about the origins of alkaline igneous rocks. In his later years Smyth suffered from poor health, which an obituary in Princeton Alumni Weekly blamed on overwork in certain rugged inaccessible wilderness portions of the Adirondacks. He contracted tonsilitis during his 1898 expedition to the Adirondacks and suffered heart and digestive troubles thereafter. He died April 4, 1937, at Princeton Hospital. The cause was pneumonia and complications from a recent hip fracture. The mineral smythite is named after him. Its properties resemble those of pyrrhotite samples Smyth studied in Upstate New York.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Henry%20Smyth%20Jr.
"Henry DeWolf Harry Smyth hnri dwlf sma May 1, 1898 September 11, 1986 was an American physicist, diplomat, and bureaucrat. He played a number of key roles in the early development of nuclear energy, as a participant in the Manhattan Project, a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission AEC , and U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA . Educated at Princeton University and the University of Cambridge, he was a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Physics from 1924 to 1966. He chaired the department from 1935 to 1949. His early research was on the ionization of gases, but his interests shifted toward nuclear physics beginning in the mid 1930s. During World War II he was a member of the National Defense Research Committee's Uranium Committee and a consultant on the Manhattan Project. He wrote the Manhattan Project's first public official history, which came to be known as the Smyth Report. On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth argued unsuccessfully against a crash course to develop the hydrogen bomb and in favor of international control of nuclear weapons. He was the sole member of the commission to vote against stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance. As IAEA ambassador from 1961 to 1970 he played an important role in the realization of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. He received the Atoms for Peace Award in 1968 and the U.S. State Department's Distinguished Honor Award in 1970. The American Nuclear Society's award for nuclear statesmanship , of which he was the first recipient, is named in his honor. Smyth was born May 1, 1898, in Clinton, New York, to Ruth Anne Phelps and Charles Henry Smyth, Jr., a professor of geology at Hamilton College. Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, convinced Smyth pere to join the faculty at Princeton, and in 1905 the family moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Henry DeWolf Smyth's elder brother, Charles Phelps Smyth, attended the same primary and secondary schools as Henry. The elder brother also received undergraduate and master's degrees from Princeton, but in chemistry. He earned his Ph.D. at Harvard University but like Henry and their father became a faculty member at Princeton. Both brothers served in the Chemical Warfare Service in World War I and on the Manhattan Project. Henry DeWolf Smyth married Mary de Coningh on June 30, 1936. He was a member of the Democratic Party. In Princeton, Smyth attended Miss Fine's School, which later became the Princeton Day School, and the Lawrenceville School. After graduating from Lawrenceville in 1914, he entered Princeton University, where he received a classical education and graduated first in his class in 1918. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. Smyth remained at Princeton to do graduate work he and Allen Shenstone were the only graduate students in the Department of Physics. Smyth earned a master's degree and Ph.D. in physics from Princeton in 1920 and 1921, respectively, studying under Karl Taylor Compton. The U.S. National Research Council awarded Smyth a fellowship, and he joined the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. There he studied under Ernest Rutherford and earned a second Ph.D. in 1923. At Cambridge he was affiliated with Caius College and formed a friendship with Pyotr Kapitsa, a Soviet physicist who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics and work briefly on the Soviet atomic bomb project. During World War I, Smyth worked in the Chemical Warfare Service and at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. After earning his second Ph.D., he returned to Princeton for the last year of his NRC fellowship. During his early years on the Princeton faculty he lived in the Graduate College west of the main campus. He was appointed an instructor in 1924, an assistant professor in 1925, an associate professor in 1929, and a full professor in 1936. In 1935 he became chairman of the Department of Physics, a position he held until 1949. During 193132 he was a Guggenheim Fellow at the University of Gottingen, where he studied the spectra of triatomic molecules, particularly carbon dioxide, with James Franck. Smyth's early research was in spectroscopy, focusing on ionization of gases by impact with electrons as a means to study the gases' critical energy levels. He published his first research article, on the radiating potentials of nitrogen gas, in 1919 this became the basis of his first dissertation. In a 1922 article, he described a method for determining the ionization energy of a molecule using anode rays and demonstrated the method on mercury vapor. In the following year he used this same method to study nitrogen. He also published on the ionization of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, and carbon disulfide. As Robert H. Dicke, Val Logsdon Fitch, and Rubby Sherr wrote in 1989, By 1935 his 30 published papers established him as a leading experimentalist in the field. In 1929 Kenneth Bainbridge completed his Ph.D. dissertation at Princeton working under Smyth, using anode rays to search for element 87. In the mid 1930s, Smyth began to shift his interest to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton splitting the atom, and Ernest Lawrence's invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last research articles concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium 3. His appointment as department chair forced him to devote more time to administrative work, at the expense of research. Richard Feynman had achieved an unprecedented perfect score on the Princeton University entrance exams, and applied for admission. While department chair, Smyth questioned his admission, writing to Philip M. Morse to ask Is Feynman Jewish We have no definite rule against Jews but like to keep their proportion in our department reasonably small . Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman's physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic . As department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946. He was a member of the subcommittee on physics of the National Research Council from 1928 to 1935. In 1936 Smyth responded to media criticism of basic science research as useless by suggesting that seemingly useless research could turn out to be very useful later. During World War II, Smyth was involved in helping the United States build the atomic bomb. From 194143 he was a member of the National Defense Research Committee NDRC 's Uranium Committee charged with producing fissile material for the bomb. Smyth proposed the electromagnetic methods that were used to enrich the first large U 235 samples for the project. He also oversaw a nuclear fission related project for the Office of Scientific Research and Development OSRD . During 194345 he was a consultant to the Manhattan Project, which built and tested the weapon, and associate director of the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, which contributed to the Manhattan Project. At the Metallurgical Laboratory he headed research on heavy water. He remained chairman of Princeton's physics department throughout the war, and the attendant obligations forced him to participate less actively in the project's later stages. In August 1944 General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, appointed Smyth to the Postwar Policy Committee, which was charged with proposing government policy for research and development of atomic energy after the war was over. The committee recommended that a national commission modeled on the OSRD fund and oversee continued production and fundamental research in government laboratories, universities, and the private sector. Smyth advocated within the NDRC for a comprehensive report to be released to the public following the weapon's first use. Vannevar Bush, who as civilian director of the OSRD oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant. Groves granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote what became known as the Smyth Report in his office in Princeton's Palmer Laboratory, which later became the Frist Campus Center. The report was first released to the press on August 12, 1945, days after the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Government Printing Office could not print enough copies to meet demand, so Smyth persuaded the director of the Princeton University Press to print more. By the end of the Press's 1946 fiscal year it had printed 103,000 copies. Smyth held the copyright to the work to prevent others from claiming it, but he permitted widespread reproduction, essentially releasing it into the public domain. He later reported that my financial balance from the Smyth Report is minus two dollars, the copyright fee. In the report, Smyth called it a semi technical report which it is hoped men of science in this country can use to help their fellow citizens in reaching wise decisions in the new Atomic Age. At the urging of his superiors, he removed several discussions of the bomb's moral implications and its creators' unease. Rebecca Press Schwartz argues that Smyth's academic background and his report's security driven focus on physics at the expense of engineering caused the Smyth Report to promote a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily an achievement of physicists. Following the war, Smyth returned full time to his duties at Princeton. He continued to chair the Physics Department and was named the Joseph Henry Professor of Physics in 1946. During this time he spoke and wrote regularly about nuclear energy and science policy and worked to expand the physics department. In early 1949, physicist Robert Bacher stepped down from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post. Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as grounded in misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists. Following the Soviet Union's successful nuclear test in August 1949, the U.S. was considering a crash course to develop a hydrogen bomb. The AEC's nine member General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended unanimously against such a course, and Smyth was one of three of the five AEC commissioners to agree. Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a hydrogen bomb program. In his autobiography, Smyth's Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb project and expressed support for the project in response to the Soviet test. In 1953 Smyth and John A. Hall served as principal advisors to President Dwight Eisenhower in preparing his Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations. The IAEA traces its origins to this speech. In 1954 the AEC was considering rescinding Oppenheimer's security clearance on suspicion that he was a Communist. Smyth was still the only scientist on the commission. Despite his personal dislike of Oppenheimer and pressure from the commission's new chairman, Lewis Strauss, Smyth was the sole commissioner to vote against stripping Oppenheimer's clearance on June 29, 1954. Smyth resigned from the AEC on September 30 of that year out of frustration with Strauss. Eulogizing Oppenheimer in 1967, Smyth said of Oppenheimer's treatment, Such a wrong can never be righted such a blot on our history never erased.... We regret that his great work for his country was repaid so shabbily . Smyth returned to Princeton and served on several high level administrative committees. This work included advising on the construction of a particle accelerator built jointly with the University of Pennsylvania and overseeing Project Matterhorn, which became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He chaired the committee that chose Robert F. Goheen to succeed Harold W. Dodds as President of Princeton. He also served as a consultant on nuclear power to Congress, the AEC, and private industry. He retired from Princeton in 1966. Smyth was a fellow of the American Physical Society and served as its Vice President in 1956 and its President in 1957. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1947 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1956. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. President John F. Kennedy appointed Smyth as the representative of the United States to the IAEA, a position with the rank of Ambassador. Smyth assumed the position on June 13, 1961, following confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Smyth shared the organization's stated goal of developing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. He helped develop what Glenn Seaborg later called an unprecedented atmosphere of rapport at the IAEA and played a crucial role in the adoption of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty in 1970. He retired from the IAEA on August 31, 1970. In September 1961, Harlan Cleveland, then Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, appointed Smyth to chair a committee to review U.S. policy toward the IAEA. The committee's report affirmed the importance of civilian uses of nuclear energy. In 1962 Cleveland again tapped Smyth, this time as an adviser to the State Department on the IAEA. In this position Smyth advocated for a transfer of national nuclear safeguards to the IAEA. In December 1965, Smyth was elected Chairman of the Board of the Universities Research Association. During Smyth's tenure, the URA signed a contract with the U.S. government to construct and operate the National Accelerator Laboratory, which later became known as Fermilab. Construction began, and research programs were planned. Smyth stepped down as chairman in 1970 but remained on the board. He also served on the board of Associated Universities, Inc., which operated the Brookhaven National Laboratory and National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Smyth received the Atoms for Peace Award in 1968 with Sigvard Eklund and Abdus Salam and the State Department's Distinguished Honor Award in 1970. In 1972 he became the first recipient of an award for nuclear statesmanship given jointly by the American Nuclear Society and the Nuclear Energy Institute. By 1974, when the award was next given, it had been named the Henry DeWolf Smyth Nuclear Statesman Award. After retiring from the IAEA, Smyth remained active. On the 40th anniversary of the Trinity test in 1985, he denounced President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and called for joint arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union. He died September 11, 1986, in Princeton. The cause was cardiac arrest, though he had long battled cancer. Smyth endowed a chair in the Physics Department in his will.

"Constantine Falkland Cary Smythe, MC sma February 1, 1895 November 18, 1980 was a Canadian businessman, soldier and sportsman in ice hockey and horse racing. He is best known as the principal owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League NHL from 1927 to 1961 and as the builder of Maple Leaf Gardens. As owner of the Leafs during numerous championship years, his name appears on the Stanley Cup eight times 1932, 1942, 1945, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1962. Smythe is also known for having served in both World Wars, organizing his own artillery battery in the Second World War. The horses of Smythe's racing stable won the Queen's Plate twice among 145 stakes race wins during his lifetime. Smythe started and ran a successful sand and gravel business. He was a big supporter of the Ontario Society for Crippled Children and the Variety Club and founded the Conn Smythe Foundation philanthropic organization. Smythe was born on February 1, 1895, in Toronto to Albert Smythe, an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889, and Mary Adelaide Constantine, an English woman. Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada, but their marriage was rocky and they did not live together for more than a few months at a time. Conn was the second of the couple's two children he had a sister, Mary, five years older, who died due to illness in 1903. Smythe remembered his mother Mary, who was known as Polly, as pretty, a drinker, and troublemaker, while Albert was quiet, a vegetarian, and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical movement. Albert Smythe was a charter member of the Theosophical Society of Canada in 1891, and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life. Smythe's first home was 51 McMillan Street, now known as Mutual Street, not far from the future site of Maple Leaf Gardens. The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe's youth, the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe's wages at the time. At one point, Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Polly and Mary stayed on North Street. Mary died in 1906, and Smythe attributed his lifelong teetotalism to his mother's drinking. At age eleven, Conn was christened, the occasion marking the first time that he insisted on the name Conn instead of his given name, Constantine. Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter, Moira. Smythe first attended high school at Upper Canada College, but disliked it and transferred to Jarvis Collegiate Institute after a year and a half. He developed his athleticism there, playing on the hockey, rugby football, and basketball teams, and playing on city championship teams in basketball and hockey in 1912. At the age of 16, Smythe met Irene Sands, his future wife, after a football game against Parkdale Collegiate Institute, which she attended. Albert Smythe wanted his son to attend university, but Conn defied his father, bolting at age 17 to become a homesteader on 150 acres 61 ha in Clute Township, near Cochrane, Ontario. After one summer building a home on the property only to have it destroyed by a devastating fire, Smythe returned home and enrolled in engineering studies at the University of Toronto in the fall of 1912. There he played hockey as a centre, captaining the Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team to the finals of the 1914 Ontario Hockey Association OHA junior championships and to the OHA junior championship the following year. The coach of the losing team in 1915 was Frank J. Selke, who years later would work for Smythe at Maple Leaf Gardens. Smythe also played on the University of Toronto football team, although not as a starter. A week after winning the OHA championship in March 1915, Smythe and his eight teammates enlisted in the armed forces during World War I. He recalled in his memoirs that he and several classmates had tried to enlist at the beginning of the 191415 season, but were told to come back when they had beards. After securing a provisional rank of lieutenant with the 2nd Ottawa Battery, 8th Brigade, on July 17, he headed to the Royal School of Artillery in Kingston, Ontario, in August for five weeks of training. He made full lieutenant on September 11, and was able to get himself transferred to the 40th Sportsmen's Battery of Hamilton, organized by publishing figure Gordon Southam, son of William Southam. The unit, with Smythe as team manager, organized a team to compete in the OHA's senior league they were one of four Toronto based teams in the league in 1916. He played one game at centre, and then decided to replace himself with a better player. The team did not complete the season, as the 40th Battery went overseas in February 1916. The Battery was ordered into the Ypres salient. On October 12, shelling found their position. killing Major Southam and Sergeant Major Norm Harvie, temporarily making Smythe commander of the Battery. The Battery fought for nearly two months in the trenches near the Somme before being relieved. In February 1917, Smythe earned a Military Cross, when during an attack the Germans counter attacked with grenades. Smythe ran into the fight and killed three Germans and helped several wounded Canadian soldiers back to safety On March 5, 1917, Smythe was awarded the Military Cross for dispersing an enemy party at a critical time. Himself accounted for three of the enemy with his revolver. After an attack where several Canadians were killed because of what Smythe thought was poor planning by the Battery's Major, Smythe wanted out. Smythe transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in July 1917. One of his instructors was Billy Barker, who would later become the first president of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Smythe served as an airborne observer, directing artillery fire. Smythe was shot down by the Germans and captured on October 14, 1917 he was imprisoned by the Germans at Schweidnitz Swidnica in Upper Silesia. Smythe made two failed escape attempts and ended up in solitary confinement as a result. He was a POW until the end of the war. Smythe would later make light of his fourteen months in captivity We played so damned much bridge that I never played the game again. Following the war, Smythe returned to Toronto. With his accrued Army salary and the proceeds from the sale of his homestead plot, he started a sand and gravel business. For a while, the venture became a partnership with Frank Angotti, who owned a paving business. To support the need for sand and gravel, Smythe bought land northwest of Toronto for a sand pit. He returned to the University of Toronto and finished his civil engineering degree in 1920, marrying Irene during the school year. Smythe and his paving business partner split, and Smythe retained the sand and gravel business. The company was named C. Smythe Limited and the company slogan was C. Smythe for sand, which he had painted on his trucks, the lettering in white on the blue of the trucks. Frank Selke, who had moved to Toronto, was one of Smythe's first employees in the business. Irene took sand and gravel orders over the phone while also caring for the couple's newborn son, Stafford. Smythe would own the business until 1961. In the evenings, Smythe coached the University of Toronto varsity team, and it was through his coaching of this team that he became involved in the NHL. The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against local colleges, with great success. In 1926, Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended Smythe to Col. John S. Hammond, who oversaw the new New York Rangers franchise for its owners, Madison Square Garden. Hammond hired Smythe as general manager and coach, and tasked him with putting together a team. But on October 27, 1926, before the Rangers had played a regular season game, Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick. Smythe believed Hammond fired him because of his refusal to sign two time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye, against Hammond's wishes. Smythe thought Dye was not a team player. Smythe applied to coach the Toronto St. Pats, but was rejected in favour of Mike Rodden. He continued coaching for the University of Toronto and took on a new senior team made up of University of Toronto players, called the Varsity Grads. The team won the Allan Cup and represented Canada at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz the following year. Smythe refused to go when two Varsity Blues players he had promised could be part of the team were blocked by what he described as a pressure play from two Grads players to get relatives placed on the team instead. One of the players was Joe Sullivan, who years later became a Canadian Senator. Although Smythe was no longer a Rangers employee, Madison Square Garden president Tex Rickard invited him to the team's opening game at the arena, an invitation Smythe nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short changed him Hammond paid Smythe 7,500 to settle his contract, but Smythe felt he was owed 10,000 . At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice presidency with the club. Smythe turned Rickard down partly because of the disputed 2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On their return trip to Toronto, the Smythes visited Montreal, where Conn bet the 2,500 on a university football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the 5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the 2,500 into 10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had recruited. While the Rangers shot to the top of their division, Smythe's hometown team, the St. Pats, were struggling. J. P. Bickell, a part owner of the St. Pats, contacted Smythe about coaching the team. However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying the team, or at least a stake in the team. Not long after, the St. Pats were put up for sale, and majority owner Charles Querrie agreed in principle to sell the club for CA 200,000 2.93 million in 2018 dollars to a group headed by C. C. Pyle, which would have moved the team to Philadelphia. Bickell contacted Smythe and told him that if Smythe could raise 160,000 and keep the team in Toronto, Bickell would not sell his 40,000 interest. After persuading Querrie that civic pride was more important than money, Smythe put together a syndicate that included Bickell and several other investors that bought the St. Pats Smythe himself invested 10,000 of his own money. Soon after the sale closed on February 14, 1927, the new owners changed the St. Pats' name to the Toronto Maple Leafs. At first, Smythe's name was kept in the background. However, when the Leafs promoted a public share offering to raise capital, they announced that one of the most prominent hockey coaches in Toronto would be taking over management of the club. That prominent coach turned out to be Smythe. He succeeded Querrie as the team's governor, and installed himself as general manager. He installed Alex Romeril as coach. For the next season 192728 , Smythe changed the team's colours from green and white to their present blue and white. According to the Maple Leafs, the blue represents the Canadian skies, while white represents snow. They were also the same colours as those of his sand and gravel business trucks. Smythe also took over as coach and for the next three years served as team governor, general manager and coach. Smythe developed a public image as a red faced, pepper pot with nicknames such as little corporal or little dictator. Smythe was not reluctant to chase players and referees on the rink and off. Smythe also developed feuds with opposing coaches and general managers. He used any tactic available to disrupt the opponent. He advertised in a Boston newspaper inviting people to watch a real hockey team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. After learning that Boston general manager Art Ross suffered from hemorrhoids, he gave Ross a bouquet of flowers with a note in Latin describing where he should shove the flowers. In 1929, Smythe decided, in the midst of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. The Arena Gardens seated 8,000 people, but the Maple Leafs were regularly playing to standing room only crowds of 9,000 customers. Smythe knew it would take over a million dollars to construct the building, and he got backing from the Sun Life insurance company for half a million. He found a site owned by the T. Eaton Co. department store chain on Carlton Street, a site he selected because it was on a streetcar line. Smythe gave up the coaching position to concentrate on the arena project. The building started construction on June 1, 1931, and was ready on November 12, 1931, after five months. As part of a corporate reorganization, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. was founded that year to own both the team and the arena. To pay for the building construction, the construction workers were paid with Maple Leaf Gardens stock instead of 20 of their pay. Selke who had union connections and Smythe were successful in negotiating the payment method in exchange for using unionized workers. During the 1931 32 season the Maple Leafs' first in their new arena , Smythe fired coach Art Duncan after five games and hired Dick Irvin to coach. Irvin promptly led the team to its first Stanley Cup under the Maple Leafs name, and the franchise's third overall. While the Leafs would go to the Stanley Cup Final every year during Irvin's tenure except for 1934 and 1937, they were unable to win another Cup. By 1940, Smythe believed that Irvin had taken the Leafs as far as he could, and decided to replace him with former Leafs captain Hap Day, who had retired as a player. Smythe also knew that he would be away in the war and felt that Irvin would not be tough enough without Smythe to back him up. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens had had a dreadful ten win season, and were looking for a new coach. At Smythe's suggestion, Irvin became the new coach of the Canadiens. Smythe first became interested in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase turned out to be one of his most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for 250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, one of the best two year old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over 100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 1001 longshot paying 214.40 on a 2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than 10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression strapped Ottawa Senators for 35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money. Smythe continued to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, when he made plans to fight in the Second World War. He did not re enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr. Maloney and Smythe's most famous horse Wonder Where, also led to the breakup of the partnership. Wonder Where, named by Maloney, was bred at Frank Selke's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, Wonder Where had an outstanding season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing Wonder Where and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that. While not the largest operation, Smythe's horses won 145 stakes races during his lifetime, a record second only to E. P. Taylor in Canada. Smythe's stable won the Queen's Plate twice, the first in 1958 with Caledon Beau and the second in 1967 with Jammed Lovely. In 1973, Smythe became a founding member of the Jockey Club of Canada. In 1977, he was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. After his death, the Smythe stable was sold in 1981 to Gardiner Farms and Harlequin Ranches, for an estimated 2.5 million. Smythe's will gave the racing stable to the Conn Smythe Foundation, which as a charitable foundation, could not run a business. The new owners leased back the farm and stables. The only horse not in the sale was Jammed Lucky, Smythe's favourite, which was given to Smythe's grandson Tommy. Jammed Lucky was 23 years old and had sired 25 winning foals to that point. In the Second World War, at age 45, Smythe again served in the Canadian Army. Initially, he was a captain in charge of a troop within the Canadian Officers Training Corps, based at the University of Toronto. In 1941, along with Colonel Richard Greer, he formed the 30th Battery, a sportsmen's anti aircraft battery that was part of the 7th Toronto Regiment, RCA Royal Canadian Artillery , Canadian Active Army. Smythe was made acting major and Officer Commanding. He was offered a higher rank to become the army's sports officer, but turned it down. After first serving on Vancouver Island to defend against Japanese attack, the Battery embarked in September 1942 to England. After being stationed in England for nearly two years, Smythe and his unit were sent to France in July 1944, where within three weeks he was badly wounded when the Germans bombed an ammunition depot. For the rest of his life he would walk with a limp and suffer bowel and urinary tract problems. He was sent back to Canada in September on a hospital ship. Smythe, who had seen that the army was using improperly trained troops due to a lack of soldiers, interviewed other soldiers during his time in the hospital, compiling a record over which to confront Mackenzie King. King had developed an official government policy of voluntary service for political reasons and Smythe saw the detrimental effect it had on the Army. Volunteers tried to press home service troops into active service to assist and augment the undermanned troops overseas. From his bed in the Chorley Park Hospital, Smythe dictated a statement to The Globe and Mail newspaper, which printed it on its front page on September 19, 1944 During my time in France and in the hospitals of France and England, I was able to discuss the reinforcement situation with officers of units representing every section of Canada. I talked to officers from far Eastern Canada, French Canada, Ontario and all the Western Provinces. They agreed that the reinforcements received now are green, inexperienced and poorly trained. Besides this general statement, specific charges are that many have never thrown a grenade. Practically all have little or no knowledge of the Bren gun and finally, most of them have never seen a Piat anti tank gun, let alone fired one. These officers are unaniminous in stating that large numbers of unnecessary casualties result from this greenness, both to the rookies and to the other soldiers, who have the added task of trying to look after the newcomers as well as themselves. I give these true facts of the reinforcement situation in the hope that Smythe was accused of acting solely for political gain. The publisher of the Globe and Mail at the time was prominent Conservative George McCullagh, and Smythe was friends with Ontario Conservative Premier George Drew. McCullagh and Drew may have used Smythe for their political ends to defeat King. The issue of lack of reinforcements was well known within the Army and Smythe did not make any complaints to senior officers while in active service. Despite being criticized, Smythe kept up his public criticism in the newspapers. After James Ralston, Canada's defence minister, traveled to Italy, he saw for himself the shortage of skilled reinforcements. Ralston, who King did not trust, was replaced with Andrew McNaughton, who was against conscription. However, even King saw the need to send troops for the Canadian Army and he ordered 17,500 reserve troops to Europe in November 1944, which started to arrive in January 1945 While Smythe was away, a committee, headed by Ed Bickle, Bill MacBrien, and Selke ran Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., with Selke as acting general manager. Upon his return from the military, Smythe found himself in the middle of a power struggle over the presidency of the company. Smythe suspected that MacBrien, a member of the board of directors, wanted to succeed Bickle as president and make Selke general manager in his own right. Smythe wanted to be president and asked Selke for his support. Selke equivocated, and the relationship between the two long time friends turned acrimonious, leading to Selke's resignation in May 1946. Two months later, Selke became head of hockey operations for the Canadiens and manager of their home arena, the Montreal Forum, succeeding Tommy Gorman. With the support of J. P. Bickell and the help of a 300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and Gardens shareholder Percy Gardiner, Smythe bought controlling interest in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., and was thus able to install himself as president on November 19, 1947. However, Smythe had been the face of the franchise for more than two decades before then. Acknowledging this, Andy Lytle, sports editor of the Toronto Star, said the appointment simply makes official what he has been for years in actuality ... Smythe and the Gardens are synonymous terms. MacBrien was made chairman. Smythe repaid his debt to Gardiner by 1960. He later succeeded MacBrien as chairman of the board. Smythe oversaw one of hockey's greatest dynasties when Toronto won six Stanley Cups in 10 seasons between 1942 and 1951. Hap Day coached the team to five of those Cups and was assistant general manager for the sixth. He was named in a poll of Canadian sports editors the most dominating personality in any capacity in sports for 1949. The Maple Leafs were masters of playoff hockey their regular season performances were usually fair to good or just good enough to make the playoffs. Smythe was known for caring little about gaudy regular season records. However, he did care about winning the Cup, because winning sells tickets. However, the Leafs spent most of the 1950s as a mediocre team, struggling under three different coaches while Day remained assistant general manager under Smythe. Even so, in 1955, Smythe turned over most responsibility for hockey operations to Day, but nominally remained general manager. However, just after the Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs in 1957, Smythe told the media that it had been a season of failure and that he did not know if the 55 year old Day would be available for the next season. Day felt Smythe had cut his legs out from under him and resigned he had spent 28 of the previous 30 years with the St. Pats Leafs as a player, coach, or executive. By this time Smythe had turned team operations over to a seven person committee, headed by his son Stafford. Newspaper owner John Bassett was another member of the committee, as was Percy Gardiner's son, George. The committee became known as the Silver Seven because the seven had been born with a silver spoon in their mouths. Initially, all members were in their 30s or early 40s, but that changed before the end of the year when 54 year old Harold Ballard, president of the Toronto Marlboros, was appointed to the committee to fill a vacancy. The committee hired Punch Imlach as general manager Imlach would later take over the coaching job as well. Smythe was an NHL owner during the era before the advent of a players' union. Between the 194243 and 1966 67 seasons, the NHL consisted of only six teams the Original Six , and players who failed to comply with team orders could easily be demoted to the minor leagues and replaced. Players who did not follow Smythe's rules were traded or sent to the minors. Two players, Danny Lewicki and John McCormack, were both demoted to the minors for getting married without Smythe's permission. While the pay for an NHL player was relatively good, it still left many players looking for other jobs during the off season, while the owners were all wealthy men. These conditions led to two efforts to organize a union, which Smythe was vehemently against. From 1957 onwards, Smythe, along with other owners, including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings, were accused of union busting activities related to Ted Lindsay's attempt to form an NHL Players Association. Smythe's role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie, Net Worth. Jimmy Thomson, who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize, was singled out by Smythe. Smythe detailed all the monies Thomson had been paid by the organization going back to junior, while arranging for Thomson to be left off the team. He also allegedly called Thomson a traitor and publicly blamed him for the team's poor season. Thomson finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs, and he and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago. The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players, such as contributing to the players' pensions. The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union, although it would eventually be organized some ten years later. Though the Silver Seven made most decisions involving the Leafs, Smythe was not a hands off owner and was constantly fighting with his son. Stafford commented My father has always given me lots of rope. When I was thirty, I was ten years ahead of everybody. But at forty, I'm ten years behind everybody. Finally, in 1961, Stafford resigned from the committee and this spurred Conn. After four years of fighting, he offered to sell his shares to Stafford and in November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a partnership of his son, Ballard, and Bassett for 2.3 milliona handsome return on his investment of 34 years earlier. Years later, Smythe claimed that he thought the sale was only to Stafford, and was furious to learn that he'd brought on Ballard and Bassett as partners. According to this account, Smythe had hoped that Stafford would eventually keep the Gardens for his son Tommy. However, it is not likely that Stafford would have been able to raise the money on his own. As part of the arrangement, Smythe resigned as president and managing director, nominating Stafford to succeed him. At Stafford's instigation, the board then granted Smythe a 15,000 annual allowance, an office at the Gardens, and a car and driver for the rest of his life. Stafford, Ballard, and Bassett then nominated Smythe as chairman of the board. Smythe stood down as governor of the Leafs on February 5, 1962a position he had held since 1927. Smythe resigned the team chairmanship after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962, and Bassett succeeded him. In 1964, Smythe opposed the plan of Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson to replace the traditional Canadian flag with a completely new design. He wrote to Pearson, whom he had known since the 1920s In the Olympic Games, the whole world is represented and when Canada sometimes wins a Gold Medal everybody knows, when the Red Ensign is raised to the masthead, that Canada has won. Smythe disagreed that a new flag would help to unify the country, and switched his support to John Diefenbaker and the Progressive Conservatives. Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament. In 1965, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada. Ballard ordered the new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of the new flag. In March 1966, Smythe sold his remaining shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. and resigned from the board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War to be offensive because, as he put it in his autobiography, The Gardens was founded by men sportsmen who fought for their country. It is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country. The Gardens was built for many things, but not for picking up things that no one else wants. He also said that by accepting the fight, Gardens owners had put cash ahead of class. Smythe stayed away from the Gardens and took shots at the ownership in the press, stating that he had been traded for 35,000 and a black Muslim minister. The seats at the Gardens had been replaced with new, narrower ones, and Smythe commented that only a slim, young man could sit in them but the prices are so high that only a fat rich man could afford them. He continued to be sought out for his views on hockey. When the NHL expanded to 12 teams from six in 1967, Smythe openly opposed the expansion on the basis that it would make for inferior hockey We had the best players in the world split between six teams, and hockey was always worth the money. By this time, Conn and Stafford were not on speaking terms, and it fell to Tom Smythe, Stafford's son, to mediate between the two. Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn, and the feud was over. After Stafford was charged with fraud in 1971 and became ill with a stomach ulcer, Conn was with him in hospital when he died. According to Conn, Stafford's last words to him were see dad, I told you they wouldn't put me in jail. After the Second World War, Smythe became involved in charities and would remain so for the rest of his life. He became heavily involved in the Ontario Society for Crippled Children. Smythe helped organize the financing and construction of their Variety Club Village complex in Toronto. In 1975, at the age of 80, Smythe organized the financing and building of the Ontario Community Centre for the Deaf, which opened in 1979. In 1960, after paying off his debt to Percy Gardiner, Smythe set up the Conn Smythe Charitable Foundation, which distributes money to charities in the Toronto area. The foundation was operated by Conn, his children and Hap Day. Day continued to help with the Foundation until his death in 1990. Before he died, Conn arranged for his grandson Thomas Smythe to continue the Foundation after his death. Smythe supervised the construction of the Hockey Hall of Fame building in Toronto in 1961. He served as the Hall's chairman for several years, but resigned in June 1971 when Busher Jackson was posthumously elected into the Hall. Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Leafs as Apps, Primeau, Conacher, Clancy and Kennedy. If the standards are going to be lowered I'll get out as chairman of the board. Jackson was notorious for his off ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages. Frank Selke, head of the selection committee, defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out because of the amount of beer he drank. The National Hockey League honoured Smythe's contribution to the game by introducing the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1965, to be presented to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. After his death, the trophy was renamed the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy. The league also named one of its four divisions, the Smythe Division, after him prior to the 197475 season. The division existed until league expansion and realignment after the 1992 93 season. Smythe Park and Recreation Centre in Toronto is located on the site of his old gravel pit. The surrounding neighbourhood is named Rockcliffe Smythe, partly a sub division Smythe built for war veterans. Smythe made provisions for a portion of the lands of the sub division to be reserved for the centre. A street north of Eglinton Avenue, west of Markham Avenue, is named Conn Smythe Drive in his honour. His autobiography, Conn Smythe If You Can't Beat 'Em in the Alley, written with Scott Young, was published posthumously in 1981. The title was taken from Smythe's credo, If you can't beat 'em in the alley, you can't beat 'em on the ice. In Smythe's memoir he describes it as the most misunderstood remark he ever made. Rather than meaning that his players should go out and bully the opposition, he meant the opposite that his players should refuse to be bullied by the opposition. Conn Smythe was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple lived in an apartment on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto to be close to Smythe's sand and gravel business, which operated a gravel pit north west of Jane Street and St. Clair. Smythe Park exists on the site today . In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live for the rest of their lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor a specialist in rheumatology, and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971. Stafford's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn's death. Smythe's father died in 1947 at 86 years of age. Smythe had had a rapprochement with his father, seeing him at Christmas and at times when Albert came to Toronto to preach. After his father's death, Smythe joined the Theosophical Society and remained a member for life. In 1977, Smythe explained why he was a theosophist It's because a theosophist teaches you that ya can't get away with anything in this life anyway. Irene Smythe was diagnosed with cancer after Christmas 1963. The illness progressed and Irene died on June 20, 1965. Due to the amount of pain Irene endured, Conn and Irene considered using a revolver to end her life, but near the end she told Conn that it was a coward's way out and she endured. After the amount of pain Irene endured, Smythe called her death a blessed release. Smythe set up a foundation at the University of Toronto in her name, which opened the Irene Eleanor Smythe Pain Clinic at Toronto General Hospital. On April 20, 1978, Smythe suffered a heart attack. He spent a month in the hospital, in time to spend May 18 at Woodbine, where he had four horses racing that day. His health continued to deteriorate and Conn realized that he was dying. He arranged for his grandson Thomas Smythe to take over the Conn Smythe Foundation, and he made gifts of money to relatives. Conn Smythe died at the age of 85 in 1980 at his home on Baby Point. He is interred with Irene at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto. Source Conn Smythe . Hockey Reference.com. Sports Reference, LLC.

"Snake Pass is a hill pass in the Derbyshire section of the Peak District, crossing the Pennines between Glossop and the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton. The road was engineered by Thomas Telford and opened in 1821. The pass carries the A57 road between Manchester and Sheffield, but it is no longer the main signposted route between those two cities. Like several other roads that cross the Pennines, Snake Pass has a poor accident record compared with roads in the UK generally, although more favourable compared with other roads in the area. It is regularly closed in winter because of snow, and has seen several longer term closures owing to subsidence following heavy rain. The road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles, however, and sections have been used for semi professional cycling races such as the Tour of Britain. Snake Pass runs through the National Trust's High Peak Estate, and lies within the High Peak borough of Derbyshire much of it falls within the Hope Woodlands parish, the remainder being within the Charlesworth parish. It is part of the shortest route by road from Manchester to Sheffield. The pass starts east of Glossop and climbs to the Pennines watershed between the moorland plateaux of Kinder Scout and Bleaklow to a high point of 1,680 feet 510 m above sea level, where it crosses the Pennine Way. After this, it passes a public house that used to be known as the Snake Inn, and descends through forest to the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton. The name of the road matches its winding route, but actually derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn, one of the few buildings on the high stretch of road. In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers to the road that referred to itself. The first road between Glossop and Ashopton was the Doctor's Gate, a Roman Road that follows the Shelf Brook between Shelf Moor and Coldharbour Moor, a route popular today with walkers and mountain bikers. In 1932, an Iron Age axe thought to be more than 2,000 years old was found near the site of this road. The current road further south was designed as a toll road by Thomas Telford to improve communications east of Glossop, which was expanding as an industrial town. It was originally called the Sheffield to Glossop Turnpike and run by a turnpike trust, the Sheffield and Glossop Trust. An act of parliament to build the road was passed in 1818, and construction was financed by the Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Devonshire. The road opened in 1821, having cost 18,625 to build. Upon opening, it was the highest turnpike road in England. The road was immediately popular and increased toll collections of traffic heading to Glossop. Tolls were abolished on the road in June 1870. The eastern end of the pass is by the River Derwent. The river is bridged by the Ashopton Viaduct, built as part of the Ladybower Reservoir project between 1935 and 1945. Although Snake Pass is still the shortest route between Manchester and Sheffield, the more northerly Woodhead Pass, which is less steep and at a lower altitude, is now the primary road link between the two cities. Unlike Snake Pass, the Woodhead route is a trunk road. Traffic levels on both passes remained similar until the 1980s, but the Woodhead Pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to the M1, while Snake Pass leads into the centre of Sheffield. Despite Sheffield and Manchester being among the largest UK cities by population, there is no direct motorway link between the two. A Manchester to Sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966, and a small section bypassing Denton and Hyde has been built, now the M67. The Woodhead Tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement, but linking the cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across the Peak District. Consequently, the plans were shelved, but reports in December 2014 announced a revival of the scheme. The road remains popular with drivers. In 2008, a survey by Caterham Cars rated Snake Pass the best driving road in the UK. The following year, it was listed as one of the best roads for driving in Britain by Auto Trader magazine, who described it as offering unparalleled views over Manchester . As would be expected for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom but it is not as dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England. In 2012 Derbyshire Police announced a campaign to monitor motorcyclists using the pass, who are particularly at risk of being involved in a fatal accident. In winter the road is often the first of the routes between Sheffield and Manchester to be closed following snow in the area. In bad storms the entire road over the summit, including marker poles, has been buried in snow. In the winter months the road becomes icy, but gritting is not a priority as the A57 is only a secondary road at this point. Local councils prefer to treat streets in towns that are more likely to be used, as they believe that roads such as Snake Pass will be closed anyway. In 1924 Derbyshire County Council spent 2,000 installing underground telegraph wire cables beneath the road, as the above ground installations were continually broken and disrupted following snowstorms. The British winter of 201011 was the coldest for decades and the road was closed on numerous occasions. Snake Pass has also been closed for longer periods owing to subsidence in the local area following rain. In January 1932 the road was closed after 200 tonnes of debris fell on it during a heavy rainstorm, covering the surface in as much as 4 feet 1.2 m in places. In January 2008 a landslip at Cowms Moor following heavy rain caused the road to be closed to all traffic between Ladybower and Glossop, although access was still available to local premises and businesses including the Snake Pass Inn. A subsequent investigation by the British Geographical Survey showed the road has had a history of subsidence related long term closures dating back to the 1930s, including a 1970s project that attempted to strengthen the layer below the tarmac with local rock fill. The road reopened in February, but with temporary traffic lights at the point of the slip restricting traffic to one direction at a time. In 2012 the road had to be closed several times for resurfacing and strengthening. Snake Pass is a popular route for cyclists. A 1902 report on leisure cycling in the Lancashire Evening Post described the eastward journey from the summit to Ashopton as nine miles unbroken freewheeling and the scenery as magnificent . The road is one of only a few road climbs in the UK that are comparable in length and average gradient approximately 7 per cent for around 3.2 miles 5.1 km when starting in Glossop to those used in continental cycle racing. The road had been part of an 82 mile Tour of the Peak race, involving climbing the pass twice, and has frequently featured in the Tour of Britain along with another nearby favourite, Holme Moss. Cycling Time Trials sanctioned hill climbs are regularly promoted on this course by local club Glossop Kinder Velo. The record for completing the course was set by Tejvan Pettinger in 2014, at 11 minutes 51 seconds. Snake Pass has been referred to several times by music groups. The track The Snake by Sheffield band the Human League, from their 2001 album Secrets, is about the road. The Squarepusher album Selection Sixteen features a track entitled Snake Pass , described by Rolling Stone as a monomaniacal thump . Comic character John Shuttleworth has performed a song called Incident on Snake Pass about the perils of Snake Pass, relating to an accident he claimed to have had, driving a Ford Anglia on the road.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake%20Pass
"Snake Rattle 'n' Roll is a platforming video game developed by Rare. It was published by Nintendo and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in July 1990 and in Europe on March 27, 1991. It was ported to the Mega Drive and released by Sega in June 1993. The game features two snakes, Rattle and Roll, as they make their way through eleven 3D isometric levels. The object is to navigate the obstacles in each level and eat enough Nibbley Pibbleys to ring a weigh in bell located in the level, which will allow the snakes to exit. The game can be played by a single player or by two players simultaneously. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was developed by Rare members Tim Stamper and Mark Betteridge, with music composed by David Wise, which features music inspired by Shake, Rattle and Roll , as well as other 1950s era oldies. It was well received by various video gaming magazines, and praises include well designed 3D environments and graphics, playability and controls, and challenge. A follow up for the Game Boy, titled Sneaky Snakes, was released by Tradewest in 1991. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll has been named one of the top games released on the NES and one of the top games released by Rare. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Rare Replay compilation for the Xbox One. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll features two snakes Rattle and Roll as they make their way through 11 isometric levels. The object in each level is to eat enough Nibbley Pibbleys small round creatures found throughout each level to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a weighing machine located at the end of the level this causes a door for the next level to open. Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat players' snake length grows more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes. When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level. At that point, they must find and jump on the scale in order to ring the bell and open the exit door. Each level contains various obstacles and enemies that the players must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues in which they can restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids in the shape of manhole covers in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was developed primarily by Rare employees Tim Stamper and Mark Betteridge. As with Rare's other NES games, it was executive produced by Howard Phillips, who would soon leave Nintendo in 1991. Stamper worked on the game's graphics and concepts, while Betteridge worked on the game program itself. Most of the ideas behind the game came from Betteridge, who had challenged himself to get the smallest file size for a NES game possible. According to Rare member Brendan Gunn, Betteridge found out how to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space. After thinking about what and how to move objects on such backgrounds, he came up with the idea for a snake. Much of the game derived from another isometric video game Marble Madness, of which Rare published the NES version in 1989. They would also use the same type of high speed scrolling that was used in the NES port of Marble Madness, which, according to a Nintendo Power overview of Rare, many said couldn't be done on the NES . Rare's future Creative Director, Gregg Mayles, started with the company play testing Snake Rattle 'n' Roll. He recalls being impressed with Betteridge's development of the controls, which he said felt really responsive . The game's soundtrack, consisting predominantly of twelve bar melodies in the early rock 'n' roll style of the 1954 song Shake, Rattle and Roll , the name of which is parodied in the game's title, was composed by David Wise. He would also compose music from Wizards Warriors, Battletoads, and the Donkey Kong Country series. According to website GamesRadar, the game's compositions revolve around 1950s era oldies so old they dont even get played on the radio anymore . One sound effect, played when a snake lands in the water and is pursued by a shark until it returns to land, quotes John Williams's two note theme from the 1975 film Jaws. It was first published by Nintendo and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in July 1990 and in Europe on March 27, 1991. Rare would later port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, a version which was released only in Europe by Sega in 1993 this port features an additional final level in addition to the 11 levels on the NES version. In that version, the snakes make it into space, but a meteorite crashes into their spaceship, causing them to crash land on another planetoid, which serves at the 12th level. After completing the level, the ending shows the snakes on a new spaceship that is going back home. Although this game was never released for the Game Boy, in level 7 of the NES version, the landscape spells out NINTENDO GAME BOY . Snake Rattle 'n' Roll first received preview coverage in January 1990 in Nintendo Power magazine. The preview said that the game defies description and that it would appeal to people who have enjoyed games such as Q bert and Adventures of Lolo. The game would be featured in the magazine's SeptemberOctober 1990 issue, which featured a walkthrough of the game's first three levels. It was also featured in UK based magazine Mean Machines, where it received high praise from editors Matt Regan and Julian Rignall. Regan praised the game's 3D environment, fun gameplay, and level of humor, as noted by the odd objects such as toilet seats. Rignall called the game's graphics stunning, with beautifully drawn scrolling forced perspective 3D backdrops and some great sprites he also lauded the game's playability and simple controls, challenging difficulty, and overall fun factor. Overall, they said Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was one of the most original games seen in years and was a firm favourite here in the MEAN MACHINES offices . The game received further reviews and praise in other video gaming magazines in 1991. German magazine Video Games called Snake Rattle 'n' Roll a quaint and original game that includes high quality graphics. The reviewer praised the animations in the characters, especially after the snakes eat Nibbly Pibbleys, and he enjoyed the two player simultaneous mode however, he said that the game lacked in variety, though the gameplay and challenge remained consistent throughout the course of the game. Another German magazine, Power Play, gave a similar review, and it compared the game to the 1988 Rare game R.C. Pro Am in gameplay. American video gaming magazine Game Players awarded Snake Rattle 'n' Roll the Game Player's NES Excellence Award for 1990 as one of the best games released for the NES that year. Nintendo Power reviewed Snake Rattle 'n' Roll as part of an overview of NES games which the magazine found were overlooked or otherwise did not sell well. Their main criticism was that the main characters were not recognizable to anyone, giving the game a lack of visibility amongst consumers. Otherwise, they praised the game for its precise controls and for its blend of puzzle and action elements. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll received some retrospective coverage years after its release. IGN ranked the game at 32 in its Top 100 NES Games list, calling it another of Rare's excellent pre second party efforts on the NES as well as Marble Madness turned into a platformer . Executive editor Craig Harris also noted the game's high level of difficulty and its excellent soundtrack. UK based magazine Retro Gamer reviewed the game in its August 2006 issue, calling it one of the best isometric games on the NES and an essential NES game . The two title characters of the game would be named Hero of the Month in the magazine's February 2007 issue. In a 25th anniversary retrospective of Rare in December 2010, the same magazine called the game an excellent platformer and was one of the games they wished would be released on Kinect the magazine received a glimpse of a Marble Madness prototype on Kinect and wanted to see the control scheme in that game implemented in a new version of Snake Rattle 'n' Roll. The game was also ranked 23 on a readers' poll of top 25 games made by Rare. UK based magazine Retro Gamer covered Snake Rattle 'n' Roll as part of its retrospective on isometric video games, saying that the game merged brilliantly the offbeat nature of games such as Head Over Heels with popular movement based isometric action puzzle titles like Marble Madness and Spindizzy . It was also covered in the GamesTM' Retro book, where it was lauded as one of the more unheralded games in the NES library. The retrospective highly praised the its visuals and landscapes, as well as having a quirky humour and a unique charm . It concluded by saying that Snake Rattle 'n' Roll stands apart from other NES games, as also did other Rare games such as Cobra Triangle and R.C. Pro Am. Due to Microsoft's current ownership of Rare, it is unlikely that either game will be released for the Virtual Console. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, along with Rare's other NES games, appear in the Xbox One compilation, Rare Replay. In the ending of Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, the game hints at a sequel titled Snakes in Space, but the game would never be released. However, Rare developed a follow up on the Game Boy titled Sneaky Snakes the game was published by Tradewest in June 1991. The game features two Snakes named Genghis and Atilla who must save Sonia Snake from the Nasty Nibbler. The game features identical gameplay to Snake Rattle 'n' Roll but in a 2D side scrolling platforming mode instead of the 3D isometric mode. Sneaky Snakes received mediocre ratings from Electronic Gaming Monthly in its July 1991 issue. Reviewer Steve Harris criticized the game for its awkward controls, lack of originality, and a zero grav effect while jumping. Ed Semrad said that the game got old after the first several levels, and Martin Alessi said that while it is an original idea, likewise repeated the previous reviewers criticism of the game's repetitiveness. Reviewer Sushi X called the game average and said, It lacks the rest of the positive traits that truly rates an exceptional game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake%20Rattle%20%27n%27%20Roll
"The Snake River is a major river of the greater Pacific Northwest region in the United States. At 1,078 miles 1,735 km long, it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River, in turn the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Snake River rises in western Wyoming, then flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, the rugged Hells Canyon on the OregonIdaho border and the rolling Palouse Hills of Washington, emptying into the Columbia River at the Tri Cities, Washington. The Snake River drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states and is known for its varied geologic history. The Snake River Plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath the Snake River headwaters in Yellowstone National Park. Gigantic glacial retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out canyons, cliffs and waterfalls along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events, the Missoula Floods and Bonneville Flood, significantly affected the river and its surroundings. Prehistoric Native Americans lived along the Snake starting more than 11,000 years ago. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the millions in the river, and were a vital resource for people living on the Snake downstream of Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark explored the area, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the dominant Native American groups in the region. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, sign language used by the Shoshones representing weaving baskets was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name. By the middle 19th century, the Oregon Trail had become well established, bringing numerous settlers to the Snake River region. Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Starting in the 1890s, fifteen major dams have been built on the Snake River to generate hydroelectricity, enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water. However, these dams blocked salmon migration above Hells Canyon and have led to water quality and environmental issues in certain parts of the river. The removal of several dams on the lower Snake River has been proposed, in order to restore some of the river's once tremendous salmon runs. Formed by the confluence of three tiny streams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, western Wyoming, the Snake starts out flowing west and south into Jackson Lake. Its first 50 miles 80 km run through Jackson Hole, a wide valley between the Teton Range and the Gros Ventre Range. Below the tourist town of Jackson, the river turns west and flows through Snake River Canyon, cutting through the Snake River Range and into eastern Idaho. It receives the Hoback and Greys Rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir, where the Salt River joins at the mouth of Star Valley. Below Palisades Dam, the Snake River flows through the Snake River Plain, a vast arid physiographic province extending through southern Idaho south west of the Rocky Mountains and underlain by the Snake River Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in the United States. Southwest of Rexburg, Idaho, the Snake is joined from the north by Henrys Fork. The Henrys Fork is sometimes called the North Fork of the Snake River, with the main Snake above their confluence known as the South Fork . From there it turns south, flowing through downtown Idaho Falls, then past the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, where it is joined by the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River, significantly altering the landscape of the Snake River Plain through massive erosion. From there the Snake resumes its journey west, entering the Snake River Canyon of Idaho. It is interrupted by several major cataracts, the largest being 212 foot 65 m Shoshone Falls, which historically marked the upriver limit of migrating salmon. A short distance downstream it passes under the Perrine Bridge. Near Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow west northwest. The Snake continues through its canyon, receiving the Malad River from the east near Bliss and then the Bruneau River from the south in C.J. Strike Reservoir. It passes through an agricultural valley about 30 miles 48 km southwest of Boise and flows briefly west into Oregon, before turning north to define the IdahoOregon border. Here the Snake River almost doubles in size as it receives several major tributaries the Owyhee from the southwest, then the Boise and Payette rivers from the east, and further downstream the Malheur River from the west and Weiser River from the east. North of Boise, the Snake enters Hells Canyon, a steep, spectacular, rapid strewn gorge that cuts through the Salmon River Mountains and Blue Mountains of Idaho and Oregon. Hells Canyon is one of the most rugged and treacherous portions of the course of the Snake River, posing a major obstacle for 19th century American explorers. Here the Snake is also impounded by Hells Canyon, Oxbow, and Brownlee Dams, which together make up the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project. At the halfway point in Hells Canyon, in one of the most remote and inaccessible sections of its course, the Snake River is joined from the east by its largest tributary, the Salmon River. From there, the Snake begins to form the WashingtonIdaho border, receiving the Grande Ronde River from the west before receiving the Clearwater River from the east at Lewiston, which marks the head of navigation on the Snake. The river leaves Hells Canyon and turns west, winding through the Palouse Hills of eastern Washington. The Lower Snake River Project's four dams and navigation locks have transformed this part of the Snake River into a series of reservoirs. The confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers at Burbank, Washington is part of Lake Wallula, the reservoir of McNary Dam. The Columbia River flows about 325 miles 523 km further west to the Pacific Ocean near Astoria, Oregon. As recently as 165 million years ago, most of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. The nearly complete subduction of the Farallon Plate underneath the westward moving North American Plate created the Rocky Mountains, which were pushed up by rising magma trapped between the sinking Farallon plate and the North American plate. As the North American Plate moved westwards over a stationary hotspot beneath the crust, a series of tremendous lava flows and volcanic eruptions carved out the Snake River Plain beginning about 12 million years ago, west of the Continental Divide. Even larger lava flows of Columbia River basalts issued over eastern Washington, forming the Columbia Plateau southeast of the Columbia River and the Palouse Hills in the lower Snake. Separate volcanic activity formed the northwestern portion of the plain, an area far from the path of the hotspot which now lies beneath Yellowstone National Park. At this point, the Snake River watershed was beginning to take shape. The Snake River Plain and the gap between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range together formed a moisture channel, opening the way for Pacific storms to travel more than 1,000 miles 1,600 km inland to the headwaters of the Snake River. When the Teton Range uplifted about 9 million years ago along a detachment fault running northsouth through the central Rockies, the river maintained its original course and cut through the southern end of the mountains, forming the Snake River Canyon of Wyoming. About 6 million years ago, the Salmon River Mountains and Blue Mountains at the far end of the plain began to rise the river cut through these mountains as well, forming Hells Canyon. Lake Idaho, formed during the Miocene, covered a large portion of the Snake River Plain between Twin Falls and Hells Canyon, and its lava dam was finally breached about 2 million years ago. Lava flowing from Cedar Butte in present southeast Idaho blocked the Snake River at Eagle Rock about 42,000 years ago, near the present day site of American Falls Dam. A 40 mile long 64 km lake, known as American Falls Lake, formed behind the barrier. The lake was stable and survived for nearly 30,000 years. About 14,500 years ago, pluvial Lake Bonneville in the Great Salt Lake area, formed in the last glacial period, spilled catastrophically down the Portneuf River into the Snake in an event known as the Bonneville Flood. This was one of the first in a series of catastrophic flooding events in the Northwest known as the Ice Age Floods. The deluge caused American Falls Lake to breach its natural lava dam, which was rapidly eroded with only the 50 foot high 15 m American Falls left in the end. The flood waters of Lake Bonneville, approximately twenty times the flow of the Columbia River or 5 million ft3 s 140,000 m3 s , swept down the Snake River and across the entirety of southern Idaho. For miles on either side of the river, flood waters stripped away soils and scoured the underlying basalt bedrock, forming the Snake River Canyon and creating Shoshone Falls, Twin Falls, Crane Falls, Swan Falls and other waterfalls along the Idaho section of the river. The Bonneville flood waters continued through Hells Canyon and eventually reached the Columbia River. The flood widened Hells Canyon but did not deepen it. As the Bonneville Floods rushed down the Snake River, the Missoula Floods occurred in the same period, but originating farther north. The Missoula Floods, which occurred more than 40 times between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills including the Palouse River canyon and Palouse Falls. The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge, a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific. The massive amounts of sediment deposited by the Lake Bonneville Floods in the Snake River Plain also had a lasting effect on most of the middle Snake River. The high hydraulic conductivity of the mostly basalt rocks in the plain led to the formation of the Snake River Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in North America. Many rivers and streams flowing from the north side of the plain sink into the aquifer instead of flowing into the Snake River, a group of watersheds called the lost streams of Idaho. The aquifer filled to hold nearly 100,000,000 acre feet 120 km3 of water, underlying about 10,000 square miles 26,000 km2 in a plume 1,300 feet 400 m thick. In places, water exits from rivers at rates of nearly 600 cubic feet per second 17 m3 s . Much of the water lost by the Snake River as it transects the plain issues back into the river at its western end, by way of many artesian springs. The Snake River is the thirteenth longest river in the United States. Its watershed is the 10th largest among North American rivers, and covers almost 108,000 square miles 280,000 km2 in portions of six U.S. states Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Washington, with the largest portion in Idaho. Most of the Snake River watershed lies between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Columbia Plateau on the northwest. The largest tributary of the Columbia River, the Snake River watershed makes up about 41 of the entire Columbia River Basin. Its average discharge at the mouth constitutes 31 of the Columbia's flow at that point. Above the confluence, the Snake is slightly longer than the Columbia1,078 miles 1,735 km compared to 928 miles 1,493 km and its drainage basin is slightly larger4 bigger than the upstream Columbia River watershed. The mostly semi arid, even desert climate of the Snake River watershed on average, receives less than 12 inches 300 mm of precipitation per year. However, precipitation in the Snake River watershed varies widely. At Twin Falls, in the center of the Snake River Plain, the climate is nearly desert, with an annual rainfall of just 9.24 inches 235 mm , although the average snowfall is 13.1 inches 330 mm . This desert climate occupies the majority of the basin of the Snake River, so although it is longer than the Columbia River above the Tri Cities, its discharge is on average significantly less. However, in the high Rockies of Wyoming, in the upper Jackson Hole area, the average precipitation is over 30 inches 760 mm , and snowfall averages 252 inches 6,400 mm . Most of the Snake River basin consists of wide, arid plains and rolling hills, bordered by high mountains. In the upper parts of the watershed, however, the river flows through an area with a distinct alpine climate. There are also stretches where the river and its tributaries have incised themselves into tight gorges. The Snake River watershed includes parts of Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, and many other national and state parks. Much of the area along the river, within a few miles of its banks, is irrigated farmland, especially in its middle and lower course. Irrigation dams include American Falls Dam, Minidoka Dam, and C.J. Strike Dam. Aside from water from the river, water is also pulled from the Snake River Aquifer for irrigation. Major cities along the river include Jackson in Wyoming, Twin Falls, Idaho Falls, Boise, and Lewiston in Idaho, and the Tri Cities in Washington Kennewick, Pasco and Richland . There are fifteen dams in total along the Snake River, which aside from irrigation, also produce electricity, maintain a navigation channel along part of the river's route, and provide flood control. However, fish passage is limited to the stretch below Hells Canyon. The Snake River watershed is bounded by several other major North American watersheds, which drain both to the Atlantic or the Pacific, or into endorheic basins. On the southwest side a divide separates the Snake watershed from Oregon's Harney Basin, which is endorheic. On the south, the Snake watershed borders that of the Humboldt River in Nevada, and the watershed of the Great Salt Lake the Bear, Jordan and Weber rivers on the south. The Snake River also shares a boundary with the Green River to the southeast the Green River drains parts of Wyoming and Utah and is the largest tributary of the Colorado River. On the western extremity for a short stretch the Continental Divide separates the Snake watershed from the Bighorn River, a tributary of the Yellowstone River, which the Snake begins near. On the north the Snake River watershed is bounded by the Red Rock River, a tributary of the Beaverhead River, which flows into the Jefferson River and into the Missouri River, part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage basin. The rest of the Snake River watershed borders on several other major Columbia River tributaries mostly the Spokane River to the north, but also Clark Fork in Montana to the northeast and the John Day River to the west. Of these, the Clark Fork via the Pend Oreille River and the Spokane join the Columbia above the Snake, while the John Day joins downstream of the Snake, in the Columbia River Gorge. It is of note that the northeastern divide of the Snake River watershed forms the Idaho Montana boundary, so the Snake River watershed does not extend into Montana. Mountain ranges in the Snake watershed include the Teton Range, Bitterroot Range, Clearwater Mountains, Seven Devils Mountains, and the extreme northwestern end of the Wind River Range. Grand Teton is the highest point in the Snake River watershed, reaching 13,775 feet 4,199 m in elevation. The elevation of the Snake River is 358 feet 109 m when it joins the Columbia River. Agricultural runoff from farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain and many other areas has severely damaged the ecology of the river throughout the 20th century. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation in the first decade of the 20th century, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply. Much of the return flows do not issue directly back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, it has become increasingly laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to the west side of the Snake River Plain and re enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40 . Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels. The Snake River's average flow is 54,830 cubic feet per second 1,553 m3 s . The United States Geological Survey recorded the river's discharge from a period of 19632000 at a stream gauge below Ice Harbor Dam. In that period, the largest average annual flow recorded was 84,190 cu ft s 2,384 m3 s in 1997, and the lowest was 27,100 cu ft s 770 m3 s in 1992. The lowest recorded daily mean flow was 2,700 cu ft s 76 m3 s on February 4, 1979. On August 27, 1965, there was temporarily no flow as a result of testing at Ice Harbor Dam. The highest recorded flow was 312,000 cu ft s 8,800 m3 s on June 19, 1974. The highest flow ever recorded on the Snake River was at a different USGS stream gauge near Clarkston, which operated from 1915 to 1972. This gauge recorded a maximum flow of 369,000 cu ft s 10,400 m3 s more than the Columbia's average dischargeon May 29, 1948. An even larger peak discharge, estimated at 409,000 cu ft s 11,600 m3 s , occurred during the flood of June 1894. The river's flow is also measured at several other points in its course. Above Jackson Lake, Wyoming, the discharge is about 885 cu ft s 25.1 m3 s from a drainage area of 486 square miles 1,260 km2 . At Minidoka, Idaho, about halfway through the Snake River Plain, the river's discharge rises to 7,841 cu ft s 222.0 m3 s . However, at Buhl, Idaho, only about 50 miles 80 km downstream, the river's flow decreases to 4,908 cu ft s 139.0 m3 s because of agricultural diversions and seepage. But at the border of Idaho and Oregon, near Weiser at the beginning of Hells Canyon, the Snake's flow rises to 17,780 cu ft s 503 m3 s after receiving several major tributaries such as the Payette, Owyhee and Malheur. The discharge further increases to 19,530 cu ft s 553 m3 s at Hells Canyon Dam on the border of Idaho and Oregon. At Anatone, Washington, downstream of the confluence with the Salmon, one of the Snake's largest tributaries, the mean discharge is 34,560 cu ft s 979 m3 s . Canadian explorer David Thompson first recorded the Native American name of the Snake River as Shawpatin when he arrived at its mouth by boat in 1800. When the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed westwards into the Snake River watershed in 1805, they first gave it the name Lewis River, Lewis Fork or Lewis's Fork, as Meriwether Lewis was the first of their group to sight the river. They also made note of the Snake Indians who lived along the river, who were actually the Shoshone tribe, and learned that the Native Americans called the river Ki moo e nim or Yam pah pa for an herb that grew prolifically along its banks . Later American explorers, some of whom were originally part of the Lewis and Clark expedition, journeyed into the Snake River watershed and records show a variety of names have been associated with the river. The explorer Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition named the river as Mad River. Others gave the river names including Shoshone River after the tribe and Saptin River. Eventually, the name Snake River was derived from an S shaped gesture the Shoshone tribe made with their hands to represent swimming salmon. Explorers misinterpreted it to represent a snake, giving the river its present day name. People have been living along the Snake River for at least 11,000 years. Historian Daniel S. Meatte divides the prehistory of the western Snake River Basin into three main phases or adaptive systems . The first he calls Broad Spectrum Foraging , dating from 11,500 to 4,200 years before present. During this period people drew upon a wide variety of food resources. The second period, Semisedentary Foraging , dates from 4,200250 years before present and is distinctive for an increased reliance upon fish, especially salmon, as well as food preservation and storage. The third phase, from 250 to 100 years before present, he calls Equestrian Foragers . It is characterized by large horse mounted tribes that spent long amounts of time away from their local foraging range hunting bison. In the eastern Snake River Plain there is some evidence of Clovis, Folsom, and Plano cultures dating back over 10,000 years ago. Early fur traders and explorers noted regional trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown some to be of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture may have contributed to the historic Shoshones, but it is not well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures. On the Snake River in southeastern Washington there are several ancient sites. One of the oldest and most well known is called the Marmes Rockshelter, which was used from over 11,000 years ago to relatively recent times. The Marmes Rockshelter was flooded in 1968 by Lake Herbert G. West, the Lower Monumental Dam's reservoir. Eventually, two large Native American groups controlled most of the Snake River the Nez Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of the Nez Perce and most of the other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy. According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe was first founded in the valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's lowermost major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes. The Shoshone or Shoshoni were characterized by nomadic groups that took their culture from the earlier Bitterroot culture and Great Basin tribes that migrated north via the Owyhee River. They were the most powerful tribe in the Rocky Mountains area, and were known to many Great Plains tribes as the Snakes . In the 18th century, Shoshone territory extended beyond the Snake River Plain, extending over the Continental Divide into the upper Missouri River watershed and even further north into Canada. A smallpox epidemic brought by European explorers and fur trappers was responsible for wiping out much of the Shoshone east of the Rocky Mountains, but the Shoshone continued to occupy the Snake River Plain. Eventually, the Shoshone culture merged with that of the Paiute and Bannock tribes, which came from the Great Basin and the Hells Canyon area, respectively. The Bannock brought with them the skill of buffalo hunting and horses they had acquired from Europeans, changing the Shoshone way of life significantly. The Lewis and Clark Expedition 180406 was the first American group to cross the Rocky Mountains and sail down the Snake and Columbia rivers to the Pacific Ocean. Meriwether Lewis supposedly became the first American to sight the drainage basin of the Snake River after he crossed the mountains a few days ahead of his party on August 12, 1805, and sighted the Salmon River valley a major Snake tributary from Lemhi Pass, a few miles from the present day site of Salmon, Idaho. The party later traveled north, descended the Lemhi River to the Salmon and attempted to descend it to the Snake, but found it impassable because of its violent rapids. The expedition named the Snake River the Lewis River, Lewis's River, or Lewis Fork, in his honor, and they traveled northwards to the Lochsa River, which they traveled via the Clearwater River into the lower Snake, and into the Columbia. They also referred to the Shoshone Indians as the Snake Indians , which became the present day name of the river. The name Lewis Fork , however, did not last. Later American explorers traveled throughout the Snake River area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806, just after Lewis and Clark had returned. The first was John Ordway in 1806, who also explored the lower Salmon River. John Colter in 1808 was the first to sight the upper headwaters of the Snake River, including the Jackson Hole area. In 1810, Andrew Henry, along with a party of fur trappers, discovered the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, which is now named after him. Donald Mackenzie sailed the lower Snake River in 1811, and later explorers included Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition who gave the river the name Mad River , Ramsay Crooks, Francisco Payelle, John Grey, Thyery Goddin, and many others after the 1830s. Many of these later explorers were original members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition who had returned to map and explore the area in greater detail. Even later, American fur trappers scouted the area for beaver streams, but Canadian trappers from the British Hudson's Bay Company were by now a major competitor. The Hudson's Bay Company first sent fur trappers into the Snake River watershed in 1819. The party of three traveled into the headwaters of the Owyhee River, a major southern tributary of the Snake, but disappeared. Meanwhile, as American fur trappers kept coming to the region, the Hudson's Bay Company ordered the Canadian trappers to kill as many beavers as they could, eventually nearly eradicating the species from the Snake River watershed, under the rationale if there are no beavers, there will be no reason for the Yanks to come. Their goal was to eventually gain rights over the Oregon Territory, a region covering Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming most of the present day region called the Pacific Northwest . However, the area was eventually annexed into the United States. By the middle 19th century, the Oregon Trail had been established, generally following much of the Snake River. One crossing the trail made over the Snake River was near the present day site of Glenns Ferry. Several years later, a ferry was established at the site, replacing the old system where pioneers had to ford the wide, powerful and deep Snake. Another place where pioneers crossed the Snake was further upstream, at a place called Three Island Crossing , near the mouth of the Boise River. This area has a group of three islands hence the name that splits the Snake into four channels each about 200 feet 61 m wide. Some emigrants chose to ford the Snake and proceed down the west side and recross the river near Fort Boise into Hells Canyon, continue down the drier east side into the gorge, or float the Snake and Columbia to the Willamette River, the destination of the Oregon Trail. The reason for the Three Island Crossing was the better availability of grass and water access. Numerous ferries have provided crossings of the upper Snake from the Brownlee Ferry at the head of Hell's Canyon to Menor's Ferry, which operates today at Moose, Wyoming. Sophistication varied from reed boats pulled by Indians on horse back at Snake Fort, Fort Boise, as described by Narcissa Whitman in 1836 to an electric operated ferry, the Swan Falls Ferry, at Swan Falls Dam of the early 20th century. One contemporary diarist crossing near Salmon Falls complains of exorbitant fees at the crossings that were a constant drain on the travelers purse. She writes that this particular route was controlled by Mormons who had built bridges where they were not needed most unmercifully fleecing the poor emigrants . The diarist expresses regret at having made the crossing describing the landscape as desolate country . Another writer similarly notes several days travel through a desert so desolate and rocky that we almost regretted that we had not continued on the south side of that stream . Unlike the Columbia River, it was far more difficult for steamboats to navigate on the Snake. The Columbia River drops 2,690 feet 820 m from source to mouth, while the Snake drops over 8,500 feet 2,600 m in elevation over a length more than 200 miles 320 km shorter. Still, from the 1860s to the 1940s, steamboats traveled on the Snake River from its mouth at the Columbia River to near the mouth of the Imnaha River in lower Hells Canyon. However, most of the steamboats only sailed from the river's mouth to Lewiston, located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers. This stretch of the river is the easiest to navigate for watercraft since it has the least elevation change, although it still contained over 60 sets of rapids. Passenger and freight service downstream of Lewiston lasted throughout the late 19th century and persisted until the introduction of railroads in the Palouse Hills grain growing region and ultimately, the construction of dams on the lower Snake to facilitate barge traffic, which caused the demise of both the steamboats and the railroad. Lewiston, 140 miles 230 km from the confluence of the Snake and Columbia and 465 miles 748 km from the mouth of the Columbia on the Pacific Ocean, became connected with Portland and other Pacific ports via steamboat service from the mouth of the Snake through the Columbia River Gorge. A commonly traveled route was from Wallula, Washington, 120 miles 190 km downstream of the Snake River's mouth, upstream to Lewiston. The Oregon Steam Navigation Company launched the Shoshone at Fort Boise in 1866 which provided passenger and freight service on the upper Snake for the Boise and Owyhee mines. By the 1870s, the OSN Company, owned by the Northern Pacific Railroad, was operating seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, all of which were built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along the Snake River than wheat and grain. In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered a boiler explosion and sank on the Snake below Lewiston. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, the reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three major categories. From its headwaters to the beginning of Hells Canyon, many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on the Snake, Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river's steep fall over a comparatively short distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the Snake River, which now serve an important purpose for people living in the drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports. The Minidoka Irrigation Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, created with the passage of the Reclamation Act of 1902, involved the diversion of Snake River water into the Snake River Plain upstream of Shoshone Falls in order to irrigate approximately 1,100,000 acres 4,500 km2 in the Snake River Plain and store 4,100,000 acre feet 5.1 km3 of water in Snake River reservoirs. The first studies for irrigation in the Snake River Plain were conducted by the United States Geological Survey in the late 19th century, and the project was authorized on April 23, 1904. The first dam constructed for the project was Minidoka Dam in 1904 its power plant began operating in 1909, producing 7 MW of electricity. This capacity was revised to 20 MW in 1993. Jackson Lake Dam, far upstream in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, was built in 1907 to raise Jackson Lake for providing additional water storage in dry years. American Falls Dam, upstream of Minidoka, was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978. As the dams were constructed above Shoshone Falls, the historical upriver limit of salmon and also a total barrier to boats and ships, no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation. Several other irrigation dams were also built including Twin Falls Dam and Palisades Dam. The Hells Canyon Project was built and maintained by Idaho Power Company starting in the 1940s, and was the second of the three major water projects on the river. The three dams of the project, Brownlee Dam, Oxbow Dam and Hells Canyon Dam, are located in upper Hells Canyon. All three dams are primarily for power generation and flood control, and do not have fish passage or navigation locks. Brownlee Dam, the most upriver dam, was constructed in 1959, and generates 728 megawatts MW . Oxbow Dam, the second dam in the project, was built in 1961 and generates 220 MW. The dam was named for a 3 mile wide 4.8 km bend in the Snake River, shaped like an oxbow. Hells Canyon Dam was the last and most downriver of the three. It was constructed in 1967 and generates 450 MW. Downriver of Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project, authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, from upstream to downstream Lower Granite Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. McNary Dam is not part of the Lower Snake River Project. Above Lower Granite Dam, the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells Canyon, is also maintained for jet boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon. However, there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors. There are many reasons why Sockeye Salmon in the Snake River are reduced in number. One reason is that the river runs through three different states, and is over 1,000 miles 1,600 km long. Salmon swimming upstream in this river are faced with predators and dams. The Snake River has fifteen dams and is extremely difficult for salmon to access because of hydroelectric dams. Hell's Canyon Dam blocks passage to the entire upper Snake River. The Grand Coulee Dam also blocks spawning grounds to the famous June Hogs legendary Chinook salmon that weighed over 100 pounds . Between 1985 and 2007, only an average of 18 sockeye salmon returned to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down. Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, a tributary of the Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered. Another interesting recovery method conservationists and biologists are using is called Fish Transportation. Since many juvenile salmon perish at each dam while swimming out to the ocean, massive ships filter and collect these baby salmon by size and take them out to the ocean for a ride, where they can be guaranteed to make it alive to saltwater. This method raises controversy to the effectiveness and costs, since this method is extremely expensive, almost costing 15 million. Another possible upstream passage solution is the Whooshh Fish Transport System. Engineers at Whooshh Innovations have developed a fish passage system that allows for the safe and timely transportation of fish over barriers through a flexible tube system via volitional entry into the system. It is found that over 60 of fisherman are in favor of dam removal on the snake river. Overall, these combined efforts have had good success. In the summer of 2006, the Snake River reportedly only had 3 sockeye salmon that returned to their spawning grounds. In the summer of 2013, more than 13,000 sockeye salmon returned to the spawning grounds. In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four dams and locks on the lower Snake River to facilitate shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep water ports on the lower Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the main product shipped from the Snake, and nearly all of it is exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports. The shipping channel is authorized to be at least 14 feet 4 m deep and 250 feet 76 m wide. Where river depths were less than 14 feet 4 m , the shipping channel has been dredged in most places. Dredging and redredging work is ongoing and actual depths vary over time. With a channel about 5 feet 1.5 m deeper than the Mississippi River system, the Columbia and Snake rivers can float barges twice as heavy. Agricultural products from Idaho and eastern Washington are among the main goods transported by barge on the Snake and Columbia rivers. Grain, mainly wheat, accounts for more than 85 of the cargo barged on the lower Snake River. In 1998, over 123,000,000 US bushels 4.3109 l 980,000,000 US dry gal 950,000,000 imp gal of grain were barged on the Snake. Before the completion of the lower Snake dams, grain from the region was transported by truck or rail to Columbia River ports around the Tri Cities. Other products barged on the lower Snake River include peas, lentils, forest products, and petroleum. The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF divides the Snake River's watershed into two freshwater ecoregions the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion and the Upper Snake ecoregion. Shoshone Falls marks the boundary between the two. The WWF placed the ecoregion boundary about 50 kilometres 31 mi downriver from Shoshone Falls in order to include the Big Wood River the main tributary of the Malad River in the Upper Snake ecoregion, because the Wood River is biologically distinct from the rest of the downriver Snake. Shoshone Falls has presented a total barrier to the upstream movement of fish for 30,000 to 60,000 years. As a result, only 35 of the fish fauna above the falls, and 40 of the Wood River's fish fauna, are shared with the lower Snake River. The Upper Snake freshwater ecoregion includes most of southeastern Idaho and extends into small portions of Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada, including major freshwater habitats such as Jackson Lake. Compared to the lower Snake River and the rest of the Columbia River's watershed, the Upper Snake ecoregion has a high level of endemism, especially among freshwater molluscs such as snails and clams. There are at least 21 snail and clam species of special concern, including 15 that appear to exist only in single clusters. There are 14 fish species found in the Upper Snake region that do not occur elsewhere in the Columbia's watershed, but which do occur in Bonneville freshwater ecoregion of western Utah, part of the Great Basin and related to the prehistoric Lake Bonneville. The Wood River sculpin Cottus leiopomus is endemic to the Wood River. The Shoshone sculpin Cottus greenei is endemic to the small portion of the Snake River between Shoshone Falls and the Wood River. The Snake River below Shoshone Falls is home to thirty five native fish species, of which twelve are also found in the Columbia River and four of which are endemic to the Snake the relict sand roller Percopsis transmontana of the Percopsidae family, the shorthead sculpin Cottus confusus , the maginated sculpin Cottus marginatus , and the Oregon chub Oregonichthys crameri . The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins. The lower Snake River also supports seven species of Pacific salmon and trout Oncorhynchus . There are also high, often localized levels of mollusc endemism, especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and middle Snake River. The mollusc richness extends into the lower Columbia River and tributaries such as the Deschutes River. Aside from aquatic species, much of the Snake River watershed supports larger animals including numerous species of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Especially in the headwaters and the other mountainous areas strewn throughout the watershed, the gray wolf, grizzly bear, wolverine, mountain lion and Canada lynx are common. It has been determined that there are 97 species of mammals in the upper part of the Snake River, upstream from the Henrys Fork confluence. Pronghorn and bighorn sheep are common in the area drained by the lost streams of Idaho , several rivers and large creeks that flow south from the Rocky Mountains and disappear into the Snake River Aquifer. About 274 bird species, some endangered or threatened, use the Snake River watershed, including bald eagle, peregrine falcon, whooping crane, greater sage grouse, and yellow billed cuckoo. Barrow's goldeneye are a species of bird that occurs commonly along the lower section of the Snake River. Ten amphibian and twenty species of reptiles inhabit the upper Snake River's wetland and riparian zones. Several species of frogs are common in the lost streams basin and the northeasternmost part of the Snake River watershed, including the inland tailed frog, northern leopard frog, western toad, Columbia spotted frog, long toed salamander, spadefoot toad. However, in the lower and middle portions of the Snake River watershed, several native species have been severely impacted by agriculture practices and the resulting non native species supported by them. Introduced birds include the gray partridge, ring necked pheasant, and chukar. Other non native species include the bullfrog, brown headed cowbird, and European starling, attracted by the construction of cities and towns. The Snake River watershed includes a diversity of vegetation zones both past and present. A majority of the watershed was once covered with shrub steppe grassland, most common in the Snake River Plain and also the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington. Riparian zones, wetlands and marshes once occurred along the length of the Snake River and its tributaries. In higher elevations, conifer forests, of which ponderosa pine is most common, dominate the landscape. The basin ranges from semi desert to alpine climates, providing habitat for hundreds of species of plants. In the lowermost part of the watershed, in southeastern Washington, the Snake River is surrounded by an area called the Columbia Plateau Ecoprovince, which is now mostly occupied by irrigated farms. The rest of the Plateau area is characterized by low hills, dry lakes, and an arid, nearly desert climate. The headwaters of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20 of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to one quarter of the forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15 of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed. The Snake River was once one of the most important rivers for the spawning of anadromous fishwhich are hatched in the headwaters of rivers, live in the ocean for most of their lives, and return to the river to spawnin the United States. The river supported species including chinook salmon, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon, as well as steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. It is known that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major chinook salmon runs in the Snake River in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000 fish, and the sockeye salmon run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain. Since the early 20th century, when Swan Falls Dam was constructed on the middle Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon, the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon. Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also had a significant impact on the success rate of migrating fish. Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam, using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams, leaving the Clearwater, Grande Ronde and Salmon river to sustain spawning salmon. Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho, the Clearwater and Salmon River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River. The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped. The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River damsLake Sacagawea, Lake Herbert G. West, Lake Bryan, and Lower Granite Lakehave also formed problems, as the downstream current in the pools is often not enough for the fish to sense, confusing their migration routes. At the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers, young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in the headwaters of the Clearwater River often delay their migrations because of a significant temperature difference. Prior to the removal of Lewiston Dam on the main Clearwater and Grangeville Dam on the South Fork Clearwater, the Clearwater was completely unusable by migrating salmon. Agricultural runoff and water held in reservoirs higher upstream on the Snake warm its waters as it flows through the Snake River Plain, so as the Snake meets the Clearwater, its average temperature is much higher. Directly below the confluence, the river flows into Lower Granite Lake, formed by Lower Granite Dam, the uppermost dam of the Lower Snake River Project. Paradoxically, the combination of these factors gives the young salmon further time to grow and to feed in Lower Granite Lake, so when they begin the migration to the Pacific Ocean, they often have a higher chance at survival, compared to those salmon who migrate to the ocean earlier. A controversy has erupted since the late 20th century over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributariesthe Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde Riverand spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create a hole in the energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow in order to create a current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit. The Salmon River is the second largest tributary. Although the Salmon has a larger drainage than the Clearwater, the Salmon drains much drier country and therefore has a smaller discharger than the Clearwater, about 8,000,000 acre feet 9.9 km3 annually compared to about 11,000,000 acre feet 14 km3 annually for the Clearwater River. The Snake River has over 20 major tributaries, most of which are in the mountainous regions of the basin. The largest by far is the Clearwater River, which drains 9,000 square miles 23,000 km2 in north central Idaho. Many of the rivers that flow into the Snake River Plain from the north sink into the Snake River Aquifer, but still contribute their water to the river. Aside from rivers, the Snake is fed by many significant springs, many of which arise from the aquifer on the west side of the plain.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake%20River
"Snakes, like other reptiles, have skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. A scale protects the body of the snake, aids it in locomotion, allows moisture to be retained within, alters the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aids in prey capture such as Acrochordus . The simple or complex colouration patterns which help in camouflage and anti predator display are a property of the underlying skin, but the folded nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to startle predators. Scales have been modified over time to serve other functions such as 'eyelash' fringes, and protective covers for the eyes with the most distinctive modification being the rattle of the North American rattlesnakes. Snakes periodically moult their scaly skins and acquire new ones. This permits replacement of old worn out skin, disposal of parasites and is thought to allow the snake to grow. The arrangement of scales is used to identify snake species. Snakes have been part and parcel of culture and religion. Vivid scale patterns have been thought to have influenced early art. The use of snake skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large scale killing of snakes, giving rise to advocacy for use of artificial snake skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, art and films. The scales of a snake primarily serve to reduce friction as it moves, since friction is the major source of energy loss in snake locomotion. The ventral or belly scales, which are large and oblong, are especially low friction, and some arboreal species can use the edges to grip branches. Snake skin and scales help retain moisture in the animal's body. Snakes pick up vibrations from both the air and the ground, and can differentiate the two, using a complex system of internal resonances perhaps involving the scales . Reptiles evolved from amphibious ancestors which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin and developing a thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, as can be seen when the snake sheds its skin as a whole. Snake scales are formed by the differentiation of the snake's underlying skin or epidermis. Each scale has an outer surface and an inner surface. The skin from the inner surface hinges back and forms a free area which overlaps the base of the next scale which emerges below this scale. A snake hatches with a fixed number of scales. The scales do not increase in number as the snake matures nor do they reduce in number over time. The scales however grow larger in size and may change shape with each moult. Snakes have smaller scales around the mouth and sides of the body which allow expansion so that a snake can consume prey of much larger width than itself. Snake scales are made of keratin, the same material that hair and fingernails are made of. They are cool and dry to touch. Snake scales are of different shapes and sizes. Snake scales may be granular, have a smooth surface or have a longitudinal ridge or keel on it. Often, snake scales have pits, tubercles and other fine structures which may be visible to the naked eye or under a microscope. Snake scales may be modified to form fringes, as in the case of the Eyelash Bush Viper, Atheris ceratophora, or rattles as in the case of the rattlesnakes of North America. Certain primitive snakes such as boas, pythons and certain advanced snakes such as vipers have small scales arranged irregularly on the head. Other more advanced snakes have special large symmetrical scales on the head called shields or plates. Snake scales occur in variety of shapes. They may be cycloid as in family Typhlopidae, long and pointed with pointed tips, as in the case of the Green Vine Snake Ahaetulla nasuta, broad and leaf like, as in the case of green pit vipers Trimeresurus spp or as broad as they are long, for example, as in Rat snake Ptyas mucosus. In some cases, scales may be keeled weakly or strongly as in the case of the Buff striped keelback Amphiesma stolatum. They may have bidentate tips as in some spp of Natrix. Some snakes, such as the Short Seasnake Lapemis curtus, may have spinelike and juxtaposed scales while others may have large and non overlapping knobs as in the case of the Javan Mudsnake Xenodermis javanicus. Another example of differentiation of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers the eye of the snake. The brille is often referred to as a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting. The most distinctive modification of the snake scale is the rattle of rattlesnakes, such as those of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus. The rattle is made up of a series of loosely linked, interlocking chambers that when shaken, vibrate against one another to create the warning signal of a rattlesnake. Only the bottom is firmly attached to the tip of the tail. At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake. Scales mostly consist of hard beta keratins which are basically transparent. The colours of the scale are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue is caused by the ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green. Some snakes have the ability to change the hue of their scales slowly. This is typically seen in cases where the snake becomes lighter or darker with change in season. In some cases, this change may take place between day and night. The shedding of scales is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In the case of snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out. Moulting serves a number of functions firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed in the case of snakes. Moulting is repeated periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake crawls out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail, in one piece like an old sock. A new, larger, and brighter layer of skin has formed underneath. An older snake may shed its skin only once or twice a year, but a younger, still growing snake, may shed up to four times a year. The discarded skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern and it is usually possible to identify the snake if this discard is reasonably complete and intact. Scale arrangements are important, not only for taxonomic utility, but also for forensic reasons and conservation of snake species. Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, overlapping like the tiles on a roof. Snakes have rows of scales along the whole or part of their length and also many other specialised scales, either singly or in pairs, occurring on the head and other regions of the body. The dorsal or body scales on the snake's body are arranged in rows along the length of their bodies. Adjacent rows are diagonally offset from each other. Most snakes have an odd number of rows across the body though certain species have an even number of rows e.g. Zaocys spp. In the case of some aquatic and marine snakes, the scales are granular and the rows cannot be counted. The number of rows range from ten in Tiger Ratsnake Spilotes pullatus thirteen in Dryocalamus, Liopeltis, Calamaria and Asian coral snakes of genus Calliophis 65 to 75 in pythons 74 to 93 in Kolpophis and 130 to 150 in Acrochordus. The majority of the largest family of snakes, the Colubridae have 15, 17 or 19 rows of scales. The maximum number of rows are in mid body and they reduce in count towards the head and on the tail. The various scales on a snake's head and body are indicated in the following paragraphs with annotated photographs of Buff striped Keelback Amphiesma stolata, a common grass snake of South Asia and a member of Colubridae, the largest snake family. Identification of cephalic scales is most conveniently begun with reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal near the snout is called the prenasal while the inner nasal near the eye is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals on both sides of the head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale. The scales around the eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as ocular scales but with appropriate prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye which is called the spectacle, brille or eyecap. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or dorsal side are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids. The scales along the lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, adjacent to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards the tip of the snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of the top of the head has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales. On the underside of the head, a snake has an anterior scale called the mental scale. Connected to the mental scale and all along the lower lips are the infralabials or lower labials. Along the chin connected to the infralabials is a pair of shields called the anterior chin shields. Next to the anterior chin shields, further back along the chin is another pair of shields called the posterior chin shields. In some texts the chinshields are referred to as submaxillary scales. Scales in the central or throat region, which are in contact with the first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a longitudinal groove on the underside of the head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales. The scales on the body of the snake are called the dorsal or costal scales. Sometimes there is a special row of large scales along the top of the back of the snake, i.e., the uppermost row, called the vertebral scales. The enlarged scales on the belly of the snake are called ventral scales or gastrosteges. The number of ventral scales can be a guide to the species. In advanced Caenophidian snakes, the broad belly scales and rows of dorsal scales correspond to the vertebrae, allowing scientists to count the vertebrae without dissection. At the end of the ventral scales of the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca a shared opening for waste and reproductive material to pass on the underside near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail. Sometimes snakes have enlarged scales, either single or paired, under the tail these are called subcaudals or urosteges. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in Bitis arietans somalica. The end of the tail may simply taper into a tip as in the case of most snakes , it may form a spine as in Acanthophis , end in a bony spur as in Lachesis , a rattle as in Crotalus , or a rudder as seen in many sea snakes. Sources. Details for this section have been sourced from scale diagrams in Malcolm Smith. Details of scales of Buff striped Keelback have been taken from Daniels. Scales do not play an important role in distinguishing between the families but are important at generic and specific level. There is an elaborate scheme of nomenclature of scales. Scales patterns, by way of scale surface or texture, pattern and colouration and the division of the anal plate, in combination with other morphological characteristics, are the principal means of classifying snakes down to species level. In certain areas in North America, where the diversity of snakes is not too large, easy keys based on simple identification of scales have been devised for the lay public to distinguish venomous snakes from non venomous snakes. In other places with large biodiversity, such as Myanmar, publications caution that venomous and non venomous snakes cannot be easily distinguished apart without careful examination. The scales patterning may also be used for individual identification in field studies. Clipping of specific scales, such as the subcaudals, to mark individual snakes is a popular approach to population estimation by mark and recapture techniques. There is no simple way of differentiating a venomous snake from a non venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake with the help of experts, 190 or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not. Species identification using scales requires a fair degree of knowledge about snakes, their taxonomy, snake scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether a snake is venomous or not in the field cannot be done in the case of uncaught specimens. It is not advisable to catch a snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. 190 Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether a snake in the field is venomous or not. 52 In certain regions, presence or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the presence or absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule of thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis. In South Asia, it is advisable to take the snake which has bitten a person, if it has been killed, and carry it along to the hospital for possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people. Snakes have been a motif in human culture and religion and an object of dread and fascination all over the world. The vivid patterns of snake scales, such as the Gaboon Viper, both repel and fascinate the human mind. Such patterns have inspired dread and awe in humans from pre historic times and these can be seen in the art prevalent to those times. Studies of fear imagery and psychological arousal indicate that snake scales are a vital component of snake imagery. Snake scales also appear to have affected Islamic art in the form of tessellated mosaic patterns which show great similarity to snake scale patterns. Snakeskin, with its highly periodic cross hatch or grid patterns, appeals to people's aesthetics and have been used to manufacture many leather articles including fashionable accessories. The use of snakeskin has however endangered snake populations and resulted in international restrictions in trade of certain snake species and populations in the form of CITES provisions. Animal lovers in many countries now promote the use of artificial snakeskin instead, which are easily produced from embossed leather, patterned fabric, plastics and other materials. Snake scales occur as a motif regularly in computer action games. A snake scale was portrayed as a clue in the 1982 film Blade Runner. Snake scales also figure in popular fiction, such as the Harry Potter series desiccated Boomslang skin is used as a raw material for concocting the Polyjuice potion , and also in teen fiction.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake%20scale
"Snakehead is the ninth episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode followed the Fringe team's investigation into horrible deaths caused by large parasitic worms erupting from their victims' mouths. The case soon leads them to a Chinese gang and a black market of immunodeficiency medicinal drugs. Co executive producer David Wilcox wrote the episode, while Paul Holahan served as its director. Andrew Orloff, the episode's visual effects supervisor, strived to makes the parasitic worms look as real as possible with the help of the actors and camera angles. It featured one time guest stars Tzi Ma, Colby Paul, Ingrid Torrance and Jack Yang. Snakehead first aired on December 3, 2009 to an estimated 6.94 million viewers in the United States. Reviews of the episode were generally negative, as multiple critics expressed their dissatisfaction that little was learned about the series' overall mythology. In Dorchester, a damaged cargo ship from China washes ashore all of the crew members seem to be infected with squid like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate in the presence of a man Tzi Ma . While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter John Noble posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better. The Fringe team discovers a Triad gang member and ties to several shell companies the gang has set up in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis Ingrid Torrance , one of the companies' large investors, but she seems unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter Joshua Jackson observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia Anna Torv back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son Colby Paul has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him to be able to go outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins. Meanwhile, an invigorated Walter ventures out to Chinatown to find a herbalist for his research unaware of the clerk's connection to the case, Walter casually mentions the giant worms. Walter manages to lose Astrid Jasika Nicole , who was sent to follow him out of worry for his ability to travel alone. She goes back to the lab, but is attacked by Triad gang members intent on getting back the remaining worms. Unaware of this, a distraught Walter becomes lost and wastes all his bus money on wrong phone numbers, causing Peter to have to pick him up. Olivia talks to Jarvis, who finally admits to being aware of the medicine. She tells Olivia the whereabouts of the incoming ship, but they find it already empty. Peter and Walter return to the herbalist shop and discover the remaining passengers. The FBI storms in and the survivors are sent to the hospital for care. Feeling remorseful about the trouble he caused, Walter injects himself with a tracking implant and gives Peter the transponder. Visual effects supervisor Jay Worth Snakehead was written by co executive producer David Wilcox, who had also written the season's third episode, Fracture . The episode gave television director Paul Holahan his first directional credit for the series. The episode featured one time guest appearances by actors Tzi Ma as Ming Che, Colby Paul as Matt Jarvis, Ingrid Torrance as Elizabeth Jarvis, and Jack Yang as Tao Chen. The episode's visual effects supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios tried to make the parasitic worms look as real as possible. He explained, ...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest. Orloff continued, And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible. Snakehead first aired on December 3, 2009 in the United States. It was watched by an estimated 6.94 million viewers, earning a 4.2 7 household ratings share and a 2.5 7 ratings share for the 1849 demographic. Fringe aired against repeats of Grey's Anatomy and CSI Crime Scene Investigation, helping the series earn a 25 percent ratings increase since the season premiere. MTV columnist Josh Wigler Critical reception for the episode was generally negative. MTV writer Josh Wigler noted the week's Fringe case for delivering an absolutely grotesque mystery of the week even if the actual plot surrounding the worms was thin and unimportant in the long run . He believed the best part of the episode was John Noble's performance, as he kills you with laughter just as easily as he kills you with tears, but disliked the focus on Astrid, believing the focus would have been better spent on Olivia. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the case pretty X Files ish and Walter's storyline the true heart of the hour. Other critics also spotlighted Noble's acting. AOL TV's Jane Boursaw believed the worms were seriously freaky and the opening scene cringe worthy. Writing for the magazine New York, critic Tim Grierson called the focus on Walter the episode's best moments, but wrote that after the audience adjusted to the ew factor, the plot wasn't all that interesting. The story line about rich, ailing Americans paying Chinese gangsters for miracle cures appeared to be a ripped from the headlines commentary on hot button issues like human trafficking and illegal immigration, but the execution just seemed silly. Conversely, Noel Murray of The Onion's The A.V. Club graded Snakehead with a B , explaining the focus on Walter was a smart choice by the Fringe team thematically . Murray continued, Ordinarily I'd be griping that this episode was yet another mythology free time waster, with a plot thattwo foot long parasites asidecould be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air. But I really enjoyed 'Snakehead,' both because of the way the story reflected who Walter is and because of all the little touches of character development and scene setting. Though not appearing as depicted, the species is a real world hookworm that infects a large number of Earth's population, which as said in the episode, has been used by some as an alternative treatment for asthma and other allergies. Popular Mechanics published an article assessing the episode's science they concluded that the worms depicted in Snakehead hybrid parasites, a new species bio engineered from an intestinal hookworm cannot grow as quickly nor as large in real life, though it is possible for hosts to die from parasitic asphyxiation . A George Washington University Medical School doctor noted that some scientists are researching the healing potential of parasitic worms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakehead%20%28Fringe%29
"Snakes on a Plane is a 2006 American action thriller film directed by David R. Ellis and starring Samuel L. Jackson. It was released by New Line Cinema on August 18, 2006, in North America. The film was written by David Dalessandro, John Heffernan, and Sebastian Gutierrez and follows the events of hundreds of snakes being released on a passenger plane in an attempt to kill a trial witness. The film gained a considerable amount of attention before its release, forming large fanbases online and becoming an Internet phenomenon, due to the film's title, casting, and premise. In response to the Internet fan base, New Line Cinema incorporated feedback from online users into its production, and added five days of reshooting. Before and after the film was released, it was parodied and alluded to on television shows and films, fan made videos, video games, and various forms of literature. Released in the United States and United Kingdom on August 18, 2006, the film received mixed to positive reviews. Despite the immense Internet buzz, the film's gross revenue did not live up to expectations, earning US 15.25 million in its opening weekend. The film grossed US 62 million worldwide before its release on home video on January 2, 2007. After witnessing a brutal murder instigated by California based gang boss Eddie Kim on U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747 400 to testify in a trial against Kim in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport LAX . To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Flynn and flight attendant Claire regain control of the plane while Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning ventilation system. Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, a tactical interrogation occurs wherein the dealer is injured by a snakebite. With Harris withholding the antivenom, the dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane and make them aggressive. Price injects the injured dealer with the antivenom and commandeers his supply of antivenom for the victims on the plane based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested and tried for death on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Harris contacts Flynn, telling him that antivenom will be ready for the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on experience playing a flight simulator. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Despite his lack of real world experience, Troy makes an emergency landing and the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and antivenom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a remaining snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to a ballistic vest he wore throughout the ordeal after his rescue from Kim's henchmen. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf. The story is credited to David Dalessandro, a University of Pittsburgh administrator and first time Hollywood writer. He developed the concept in 1992 after reading a nature magazine article about Indonesian brown tree snakes climbing onto planes in cargo during World War II. He originally wrote the screenplay about the brown tree snake loose on a plane, titling the film Venom. He soon revised it, expanding upon the premise to include a plague of assorted venomous snakes, thencrediting the film Aliensrevised it once again to include lots of them loose in the fuselage of a plane. Dalessandro's third draft of Venom was turned down by more than 30 Hollywood studios in 1995. In 1999, a producer for MTV Paramount showed interest in the script, followed up by New Line Studios, which took over the rights for production. Originally, the film, under the working title Snakes on a Plane , was going to be directed by Hong Kong action director Ronny Yu. Jackson, who had previously worked with Yu on The 51st State, learned about the announced project in the Hollywood trade newspapers and, after talking to Yu, agreed to sign on without reading the script based on the director, storyline, and the title. Initially New Line did not believe that Jackson had actually signed on to the project and had to call his agent to clarify. Jackson would later defend his choice of starring in the movie by stating it was the kind of movie I would have gone to see when I was a kid further clarifying I feel sorry for all those people that are going through that whole trip of Why would Samuel Jackson do something like this and Its lowbrow. Its a movie. People go to movies on Saturday to get away from the war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and just go and have some fun and I like doing movies that are fun. The film's B movie esque title generated a lot of pre release interest on the Internet. One journalist wrote that Snakes on a Plane is perhaps the most internet hyped film of all time . Much of the initial publicity came from a blog entry made by screenwriter Josh Friedman, who had been offered a chance to work on the script. The casting of Samuel L. Jackson further increased anticipation. At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel Jackson's request. In August 2005, Samuel Jackson told an interviewer, We're totally changing that back. That's the only reason I took the job I read the title. On March 2, 2006, the studio reverted the title to Snakes on a Plane. New Line hired two additional writers to smooth out the screenplay. Taking advantage of the Internet buzz for what had been a minor film in their 2006 line up, New Line Cinema ordered five days of additional shooting in early March 2006 principal photography had wrapped in September 2005 . While re shoots normally imply problems with a film, the producers opted to add new scenes to the film to change the MPAA rating from PG 13 to R and bring it in line with growing fan expectations. The most notable addition was a revision of a catchphrase from the film that was parodied on the Internet by fans of the film, capitalizing on Samuel L. Jackson's typically foul mouthed and violent film persona Enough is enough I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane . Subsequently, the public responded favorably to this creative change and marketing strategy, leading some members of the press to speculate that the movie has grown from something of a joke into a phenomenon . More than 450 snakes were used for filming to represent thirty different species of snakes. The different species include a 19 foot 5.8 m Burmese python named Kitty which the crew called Kong for film purposes , scarlet kingsnake the non venomous double for the coral snake , milk snake, corn snakes, rattlesnakes, and mangrove snakes. The scarlet kingsnake and milk snake stood in for coral snakes, while a Florida kingsnake filled the role of the venomous Australian taipan which attacks the couple having sex . About two thirds of the snakes seen throughout the film were either animatronic or CGI. The snakes that were real were mostly the non venomous ones that are never seen attacking anyone. The scenes where someone is clearly bitten were often done with animation. According to the DVD, all the snakes had production names, but only Scarface an animated pit viper , Peanut a cobra , and Kong are mentioned by name in the audio commentary. During filming, Samuel Jackson did not come into contact with any live snakes, due to a contract clause preventing snakes from being within 8 m 25 ft of the actor. When the film was released in theaters, two live western diamondback rattlesnakes were released at a showing of the film on August 22, 2006, in Phoenix, Arizona. One snake had made its way into the lobby of the theater on its own, and another had been found in the parking lot. Nobody was harmed and the snakes were released back into the desert. An illustrated book from Thunder's Mouth Press, Snakes on a Plane The Guide to the Internet Ssssssensation by David Waldon, details the Internet phenomenon and was published July 28, 2006. Waldon details various viral videos relating to the film's craze, and interviewed their producers to find out what about the film captured their attention. On March 16, 2006, New Line Cinema announced a contest on TagWorld and a website promoting the film. The contest allowed artists on TagWorld to have their music featured in the film. A flood of SoaP themed songs were submitted by artists such as Captain Ahab who ultimately won the contest , Louden Swain, the Former Fat Boys, Nispy, and others. In addition, a music video for the film, Snakes on a Plane Bring It by Cobra Starship, was released on July 10, 2006 on MTV2's Unleashed. The music video appeared on the film's soundtrack as well as during the film's closing credits. In October 2005, Nathanial Perry and Chris Rohan recorded an audio trailer spoof, which helped fuel the Internet buzz. Perry and Rohan recorded the motherfucking snakes line in the audio trailer which was added to the film during the week of re shoots. In July 2006, New Line Cinema signed a worldwide licensing agreement with the Cutting Corporation to produce an audiobook of the film. On August 15, 2006, Samuel L. Jackson guest featured on The Daily Show, opening with the film's catchphrase. Keith Olbermann featured stories about the film and Internet buzz several times on his MSNBC news program Countdown. In addition, G4's Attack of the Show featured a semi regular segment entitled Snakes on a Plane An Attack of the Show Investigation , and had a week dedicated to the film which included interviews and the appearance of hundreds of snakes on set. Snakes on a Plane generated considerable buzz on the Internet after Josh Friedman's blog entry and mentions on several Internet portals. The title inspired bloggers to create songs, apparel, poster art, pages of fan fiction, parody films, mock movie trailers, and short film parody competitions. On July 6, 2006, the official Snakes on a Plane website started a promotional sweepstakes called The 1 Fan King Cobra Sweepstakes . The contest made innovative use of the publicity generating potential of the Internet, requiring contestants to post links on forums, blogs, and websites and collecting votes from the users of those sites. Many of the early fan made trailers and later other viral videos and commercials circulated via YouTube, and captured media attention there with such titles as Cats on a Plane which was featured in Joel Siegel's review of Snakes on a Plane on Good Morning America , Snakes Who Missed the Plane, All Your Snakes Are Belong To Us a spoof of the All your base are belong to us phenomenon , Steaks on a Train, and Badgers on a Plane a spoof of Badger Badger Badger . Several websites also held contests about the film in fan submitted short films and posters. In August 2006, Varitalk launched an advertising campaign in which fans could send a semi personalized message in Samuel Jackson's voice to telephone numbers of their choosing. Within the first week, over 1.5 million calls were sent to participants. In June 2006, New Line commissioned famed UK audio visual film remixers and chop up artists Addictive TV to cut and sample Snakes on a Plane to create trailers for the U.S. television networks. The official teaser trailer premiered before X Men The Last Stand, and the first official trailer appeared online on June 26, 2006. Another trailer circulated in July 2006, showing several of the snake attacks and a missing pilot and co pilot. Rotten Tomatoes had video clips of the official trailers, as well as fan made trailers. During a July 21, 2006 panel discussion at the Comic Con Convention in San Diego, California, a preview clip from the film was shown to a crowd of more than 6,500 people. The panel included actors Samuel L. Jackson and Kenan Thompson, director David R. Ellis, and snake handler Jules Sylvester. Samuel L. Jackson, joking that the film would win the MTV Movie Award for Best Film in 2007 Snakes on a Plane debuted on August 18, 2006. The film opened in 3,555 theaters and had some late night screenings on August 17. In a move meant to exploit the attention from the film, a straight to DVD Z movie horror film with a supernatural twist, Snakes on a Train, was released on August 15, 2006, three days before the film's theatrical release. In mid July 2006, New Line Cinema announced that it would not be showing any advance screenings for critics. After the film opened, the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 69 based on 175 reviews, with an average score of 6.22 10 and the consensus Snakes on a Plane lives up to its title, featuring snakes on a plane. It isn't perfect, but then again, it doesn't need to be. At the website Metacritic, which uses a weighted average rating system, the film earned a mixed rating of 58 based on 31 reviews by mainstream critics. Reviewers reported audiences cheering, applauding, and engaging in call and response , noting that audience participation was an important part of the film's appeal. The Arizona Republic's Randy Cordova gave the film a positive review, calling the film ... an exploitation flick that knows what it wants to do, and it gets the job done expertly. and a ... Mecca for B movie lovers. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle enjoyed the film, asking his readers ... if you can find a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let me in on it. Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr reacted to Samuel L. Jackson's performance by saying he ... bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge. He's as much the auteur of this baby as the director and screenwriters, and that fierce glimmer in his eye is partly joy. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying that after all the Internet hype about those motherfuckin' snakes on that motherfuckin' plane, the flick itself is a murky stew of shock effects repeated so often that the suspense quickly droops along with your eyelids. David Denby of The New Yorker claimed that the film ... may mark a new participatory style in marketing, but it still gulls an allegedly knowing audience with the pseudo morality of yesteryear. Film critic and radio host Michael Medved criticized New Line Cinema for agreeing to re shoot scenes so that the film would receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to match fan expectations. He argued that the film would have grossed more revenue at the box office with a PG 13 rating, stating that the demographic most likely to be drawn to a movie titled Snakes on a Plane is males between the ages of 12 and 15. My fourteen year old son, Danny, for instance, felt a powerful inclination to go out and see the movie with his two sleep over friends this Sunday night, he explained, but I wouldn't permit it. It's rated R for good reason. Medved ultimately awarded the film 2 1 2 stars out of 4 in a radio review, but said that he did so grudgingly. Due to the Internet hype surrounding the film, industry analysts estimated that the film's opening box office would be between US 20 30 million. While Snakes on a Plane did narrowly beat Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby for the number one position during its opening weekend, it did not meet these estimates and grossed only 15.25 million in its opening days, a disappointment for New Line Cinema. In its second weekend, the film fell to sixth place with 6.4 million, a more than fifty percent drop from its opening weekend revenue. By the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed 62,022,014 worldwide. Robert K. Shaye, the founder of New Line, stated that he was disappointed that Snakes on a Plane was a dud despite higher expectations . The press declared that Snakes on a Plane was a box office disappointment , with The New York Times reporting that after all the hype online, Snakes on a Plane is letdown at box office and Entertainment Weekly reporting that the film was an internet only phenomenon. Snakes on a Plane released on DVD December 26, 2006 in Region 2 December 28, 2006 in Region 4 and January 2, 2007 in Region 1. The DVD features commentaries, deleted and extended scenes, several featurettes, Cobra Starship's music video, and trailers. The U.S. Blu ray was released on September 29, 2009. The film received further attention when fans noticed the U.S. TV edit of the film purposely dubbed over foul language, replacing it with bowdlerized words for family audiences. An example is Samuel L. Jackson's line toward the end of the film, I have had it with these motherfuckin' snakes on this motherfuckin' plane , which is replaced with I have had it with these monkey fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane . Black Flame published the novelization of the film, written by Christa Faust. The 405page novel contains significant backstories for the characters and introduces other characters that were not featured in the film. Comic book writer Chuck Dixon wrote a comic book adaptation of the film. DC Comics released the two issue miniseries on August 16, 2006 and September 27, 2006 under their Wildstorm imprint. The soundtrack for the film was released on August 15, 2006. The enhanced portion of the CD contains what was considered the best of the best of the amateur Internet creations inspired by the film, including the songs Snakes on the Brain by Captain Ahab and Here Come the Snakes Seeing Is Believing by Louden Swain. The single Snakes on a Plane Bring It peaked at the 32nd position of Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2006.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes%20on%20a%20Plane
"Snapdragon is a suite of system on a chip SoC semiconductor products for mobile devices designed and marketed by Qualcomm Technologies Inc. The Snapdragon central processing unit CPU uses the ARM RISC instruction set. A single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, an Adreno graphics processing unit GPU , a Snapdragon wireless modem, a Hexagon Digital signal processor DSP , a Qualcomm Spectra Image Signal Processor ISP and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system GPS , camera, video, audio, gesture recognition and AI acceleration. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android, Windows Phone and netbooks. They are also used in cars, wearable devices and other devices. In addition to the processors, the Snapdragon line includes modems, wi fi chips and mobile charging products. The first Snapdragon product to be made available to consumer device manufacturers was the QSD8250, which was released in December 2007. It included the first 1 GHz processor for mobile phones. Qualcomm introduced its Krait microarchitecture in the second generation of Snapdragon SoCs in 2011, allowing each processor core to adjust its speed based on the device's needs. At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, Qualcomm introduced the first of the Snapdragon 800 series and renamed prior models as the 200, 400 and 600 series. Several new iterations have been introduced since, such as the Snapdragon 805, 810, 615 and 410. Qualcomm re branded its modem products under the Snapdragon name in December 2014. As of 2018 , Asus, HP and Lenovo have begun selling laptops with Snapdragon based CPUs running Windows 10 under the name Always Connected PCs , marking an entry into the PC market for Qualcomm and the ARM architecture. Qualcomm announced it was developing the Scorpion central processing unit CPU in November 2007. The Snapdragon system on chip SoC was announced in November 2006 and included the Scorpion processor, as well as other semiconductors. This also included Qualcomm's first custom Hexagon digital signal processor DSP . According to a Qualcomm spokesperson, it was named Snapdragon, because Snap and Dragon sounded fast and fierce. The following month, Qualcomm acquired Airgo Networks for an undisclosed amount it said Airgo's 802.11a b g and 802.11n Wi Fi technology would be integrated with the Snapdragon product suite. Early versions of Scorpion had a processor core design similar to the Cortex A8. The first Snapdragon shipments were of the QSD8250 in November 2007. According to CNET, Snapdragon claim to fame was having the first 1 GHz mobile ma processor. Most smartphones at the time were using 500 MHz processors. The first generation of Snapdragon products supported a 720p resolution, 3D graphics and a 12 megapixel camera. By November 2008, 15 device manufacturers decided to embed Snapdragon semiconductors in their consumer electronics products. In November 2008, Qualcomm announced it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual core Snapdragon system on chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced around the same time and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5 GHz processors and was intended for developing markets. In May 2009, Java SE was ported and optimized for Snapdragon. At the November 2009 Computex Taipei show, Qualcomm announced the QSD8650A addition to the Snapdragon product suite, which was based on 45 nanometer manufacturing processes. It featured a 1.2 GHz processor and had lower power consumption than prior models. By late 2009, smartphone manufacturers announced they would be using Snapdragon SoCs in the Acer Liquid Metal, HTC HD2, Toshiba TG01 and the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10. Lenovo announced the first netbook product using Snapdragon SoCs that December. According to PC World, mobile devices using Snapdragon had better battery life and were smaller in size than those using other SoCs. By June 2010, Snapdragon chips were embedded in 20 available consumer devices and incorporated into 120 product designs in development. Apple had a dominant market position for smartphones at the time and did not incorporate Snapdragon into any of its products. The success of Snapdragon therefore relied on competing Android phones, such as Google's Nexus One and the HTC Incredible, challenging Apple's market position. Android devices did end up taking market share from the iPhone and predominantly used Snapdragon. There was an unconfirmed but widely circulated report speculating that Apple was going to start using Snapdragon SoCs in Verizon based iPhones. As of 2012, Apple was still using their own Ax semiconductor designs. Support for the Windows Phone 7 operating systems was added to Snapdragon in October 2010. By 2011 Snapdragon was embedded in Hewlett Packard's WebOS devices and had a 50 market share of a 7.9 billion smartphone processor market. By 2012, the Snapdragon S4 Krait core had taken a dominant share from other Android system on chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips were embedded in 41 of smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64 bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to release a competing 64 bit product, despite the capable performance of the Snapdragon 800 801 805, since their existing Krait cores were only 32 bit. The first 64 bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex A57 and Cortex A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led Samsung to stop using Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone, and Galaxy Note 5 phablet. Snapdragon chips are also used in most Android based smartwatches. Snapdragon products have also been used in virtual reality products, in vehicles like the Maserati Quattroporte and Cadillac XTS and in other applications. In June 2010, Qualcomm began sampling the third generation of Snapdragon products two dual core 1.2 GHz system on chips SoC called the Mobile Station Modem MSM 8260 and 8660. The 8260 was for GSM, UMTS and HSPA networks, while the 8660 was for CDMA2000 and EVDO networks. That November Qualcomm announced the MSM8960 for LTE networks. In early 2011, Qualcomm announced a new processor architecture called Krait, which used the ARM v7 instruction set, but was based on Qualcomm's own processor design. The processors were called S4 and had a feature named Asynchronous Symmetrical Multi Processing aSMP , meaning each processor core adjusted its clock speed and voltage based on the device's activity in order to optimize battery usage. Prior models were renamed to S1, S2 and S3 to distinguish each generation. The S4 based generation of Snapdragon SoCs began shipping to product manufacturers with the MSM8960 in February 2012. In benchmark tests by Anandtech, the MSM8960 had better performance than any other processor tested. In an overall system benchmark, the 8960 obtained a score of 907, compared to 528 and 658 for the Galaxy Nexus and HTC Rezound respectively. In a Quadrant benchmark test, which assesses raw processing power, a dual core Krait processor had a score of 4,952, whereas the quad core Tegra 3 was just under 4,000. The quad core version, APQ8064, was made available in July 2012. It was the first Snapdragon SoC to use Qualcomm's Adreno 320 graphics processing unit GPU . Adoption of Snapdragon contributed to Qualcomm's transition from a wireless modem company to one that also produces a wider range of hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid 2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit SDK for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors. By 2012, the Snapdragon S4 Krait core had taken a dominant share from other Android system on chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips powered 41 of smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64 bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to rush out a competing 64 bit solution, despite the capable performance of the Snapdragon 800 801 805, since their existing Krait cores were only 32 bit. The first 64 bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex A57 and Cortex A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led to Samsung ditching Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone. The entry level 200 series was expanded with six new processors using 28 nanometer manufacturing and dual or quad core options in June 2013. The entry level Snapdragon 210, intended for low cost phones, was announced in September 2014. After, Qualcomm's first attempt at 64 bit system on a chip, they created a new in house architecture, that in later models showed better thermal performance. Especially when compared to the Snapdragon models launched after 2015, like the Snapdragon 820. In early 2016, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 820, an ARM 64 bit quad core processor using in house designed Kryo cores. Qualcomm launched an updated Snapdragon 821, later in the year with higher clock speeds and slightly better performance. The Snapdragon 820 family uses Samsung's 14 nanometer FinFET process. Qualcomm also released the Qualcomm Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK which was the first AI acceleration on smartphones. Qualcomm announced the octa core Snapdragon 835 SoC on November 17, 2016. Released the following year, it used Kryo 280 cores and was built using Samsung's 10 nanometer FinFET process. At initial launch, due to Samsung's role in manufacturing the chip, its mobile division also acquired the initial inventory of the chip. That means that no other phone maker was able to manufacture products containing the Snapdragon 835 until Samsung released its flagship device of the year, the Galaxy S8. At Computex 2017 in May, Qualcomm and Microsoft announced plans to launch Snapdragon based laptops running Windows 10. It partnered with HP, Lenovo, and Asus to release slim portables and 2 in 1 devices powered by the Snapdragon 835. In December 2017, Qualcomm announced the octa core Snapdragon 845. It uses the same 10 nanometer manufacturing process as the earlier Snapdragon 835 but introduced a new processor architecture, Kryo 385, designed for better battery life, photography, and for use with artificial intelligence apps. In early 2018, Qualcomm introduced the 7 series, which sits between the 6 and 8 series in terms of pricing and performance. The 700 launched with octa core models Snapdragon 710 and 712, using the Kryo 360 processor architecture, and built on a 10 nanometer manufacturing process. In 2019, Qualcomm released new variants of its mobile processors, with the Snapdragon 855 replacing the 845. The Snapdragon 855 competes against other high end system on chip solutions like the Apple A12, and Kirin 980. The Snapdragon 855 features Kryo 485 cores, built on TSMC's 7 nanometer process. Along with the Snapdragon 730 and 730G replacing the 710 and 712. The newer 730 and 730G feature Kryo 460 cores, built on Samsung's 8 nanometer process. Snapdragon system on chip products typically include a graphics processing unit GPU , a global positioning system GPS and a cellular modem integrated into a single package. It has software included that operates graphics, video and picture taking. There are 19 different Snapdragon processors under the 400, 600 and the 800 product families spanning from low to high end respectively, as well as wi fi and mobile charging products. Some of their components include the Adreno graphics processing, the Qualcomm Hexagon DSP and processors using Qualcomm's S4 processor architecture. In addition to smartphones, the 400 series is used in smart watches and the 602A is intended for electronics in cars. The current Snapdragon naming scheme was implemented after the Snapdragon 800 family was announced at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show prior models were renamed to the 200, 400 or 600 series. A new Snapdragon 600 was also released, which by mid year was embedded in most new Android devices. The 400 family is entry level, the 600 is mass market or mid range, and 800 family is for high end or flagship phones. The Snapdragon 805 was released that November. The 410, which is intended for low cost phones in developing nations, was announced the following month. In January 2014, Qualcomm introduced a modified version of the Snapdragon 600 called 602A that is intended for in car infotainment screens, backup cameras, and other driver assistance products. The quad core Snapdragon 610 and eight core 615 were announced in February 2014. The Snapdragon 808 and 810 were announced in April 2014. The Snapdragon 835, announced in November 2017, is the first Qualcomm SOC that is built on a 10 nm architecture. Qualcomm's new flagship chip for 2018, the 845, was announced in December 2017. According to Qualcomm, the 845 is 25 30 faster than the 835. In February 2015, Qualcomm re branded its stand alone modem products under the Snapdragon name they were distinguished from SoCs using the x designation, such as the X7 or X12 modem. The first Snapdragon modem for 5G networks, the X50, was announced in late 2016. This was followed by the 2GBs X24 modem on a 7 nanometer manufacturing process that was announced in February 2018. According to CNET, these phones were growing in US market share and ranked highly in CNET reviews due to their responsiveness. Snapdragon SoCs are also used in most Windows phones and most phones entering the market in mid 2013. The LG G2 was the first phone to market using the Snapdragon 800 in August 2013. In 2017 the 660 and 630 replaced the 653 and 626 mid range models and several chips in the 400 product family were revved. In February 2017, Qualcomm introduced the Snapdragon X20, intended for 5G cell phone networks, and two new chips for 802.11ax commercial wi fi networks. This was followed by the addition of the 636 to the 600 product family that October, which Qualcomm said would be 40 percent faster than the 630. In August 2018, the Snapdragon 632, 439 and 429 were released. The new SoC is aimed at mid range devices such as the Moto G6 Play, Huawei Honor 7A and Nokia 5. In December 2018, Qualcomm announced the 8cx at their Snapdragon Tech Summit 2018. The 8cx is Qualcomm's first SoC specifically designed for Always Connected PC ACPC platform. Unlike Qualcomm's past ACPC SoCs which were just their respective mobile SoCs at higher TDP. Qualcomm also showcased their Snapdragon X50 5G modem, Snapdragon 855 and QTM052 mmWave Antenna Module. In February 2019, Qualcomm announced their Snapdragon X55 5G modem, QTM525 mmWave antenna module, QET6100 envelope tracker and the new QAT3555 antenna impedance tuner. Benchmark tests of the Snapdragon 800's processor by PC Magazine found that its processing power was comparable to similar products from Nvidia. Benchmarks of the Snapdragon 805 found that the Adreno 420 GPU resulted in a 40 percent improvement in graphics processing over the Adreno 330 in the Snapdragon 800, though there were only slight differences in processor benchmarks. Benchmarks of the Snapdragon 801 inside an HTC One found a bump all around in benchmark improvements over the 800. In 2015, Samsung's decision not to use the Snapdragon 810 in its Galaxy S6 had a significant detrimental impact on Snapdragon's revenues and reputation.

"Snatcher is a cyberpunk graphic adventure game developed and published by Konami. It was written and designed by Hideo Kojima and first released in 1988 for the PC 8801 and MSX2 in Japan. Snatcher is set in a future East Asian metropolis where humanoid robots dubbed Snatchers have been discovered killing humans and replacing them in society. The player takes on the role of Gillian Seed, an amnesiac who joins a Snatcher hunting agency hoping it will help him remember his past. Gameplay takes place primarily through a menu based interface through which the player can choose to examine items, search rooms, speak to characters, explore a semi open world, and perform other actions. Kojima wanted Snatcher to have a cinematic feel, so the setting and story are heavily influenced by science fiction films, especially Blade Runner, and other cyberpunk works such as Akira and The Terminator. Development on the PC versions took more than twice as long as the average game of the time, even after Kojima was asked to trim more than half his initial story. The game was released to positive reviews, but poor sales. It garnered a cult following, and was remade as a role playing game called SD Snatcher for the MSX2 in 1990. This was followed by a remake of the original adventure game using CD ROM technology, released for the PC Engine Super CD ROM2 System in 1992. Looking to provide a more interactive experience to gamers in the West, Konami developed a Sega CD version of Snatcher specifically for North America and Europe in 1994. Although it too was released to a poor commercial reception, the Sega CD version received mostly positive reviews for its cinematic presentation and mature themes uncommon in games at the time. Snatcher has been retrospectively acclaimed as both one of the best adventure and cyberpunk games of all time, and identified as a foundation for the themes Kojima explored later in the Metal Gear series. The game was a significant inspiration on Goichi Suda, who worked with Kojima to produce a radio drama prequel, Sdatcher. The English version of Snatcher has never been rereleased, despite desire from fans. Snatcher is a graphic adventure game with visual novel elements. The player takes the role of protagonist Gillian Seed as he investigates and hunts Snatchers , dangerous humanoid robots disguised as humans roaming Neo Kobe City. The game's visuals are static images with some animations that display at the top of the screen. There is no point and click interface, with all actions made through a text menu with commands such as move, look, and investigate. The game's puzzles and dialogue trees are simple, lending to an emphasis on linear storytelling. Sometimes character panels are shown below the main graphics window during conversations to convey their facial expressions. The game allows exploration of a semi open world. There are a handful of action segments where the player shoots at enemies dispersed across a 3x3 grid. The Sega CD version supports the Justifier light gun packaged with Lethal Enforcers for these segments. Snatcher is set in the mid 21st century, fifty years after a biological weapon known as Lucifer Alpha killed much of the world's population. In Neo Kobe City, a metropolis on an artificial island in eastern Asia, humanoid robots dubbed Snatchers have been recently discovered killing humans, donning their skin as a disguise, and replacing them in society. The Neo Kobe government closes the city from the outside world and establishes JUNKER, a task force to hunt Snatchers. The player takes on the role of Gillian Seed, an amnesiac who can only remember that his past is somehow related to Snatchers. He starts working at JUNKER in hopes that hunting Snatchers will bring his past to light. After Gillian Seed arrives at the JUNKER headquarters, he is introduced to Chief Cunningham and receives a robot navigator named Metal Gear from JUNKER's engineer Harry Benson. Metal Gear receives a distress call from Jean Jack Gibson, the only other JUNKER agent, so Gillian travels there with Metal Gear, only to find a pair of Snatchers have killed him. They try to pursue the Snatchers, but are forced to make a quick escape as the factory explodes. Gillian begins searching for the identity of the Snatchers that murdered Jean Jack, and after searching his house and speaking with his informant, Gillian identifies a pair of suspects. When hunting down the Snatchers, he is nearly killed but is saved by Random Hajile, a Snatcher bounty hunter. Random joins Gillian and Metal Gear as they travel to a hospital Jean Jack identified as suspicious during his investigation. They learn it has been abandoned for several years and harbors a secret basement where they find skeletons of Snatcher victims. Among them, they find Chief Cunningham, meaning the JUNKER chief is a Snatcher. Some Snatchers attack the group, but Random distracts them to allow Gillian and Metal Gear to escape. Back at JUNKER headquarters, Gillian kills the Chief and speaks to Harry briefly before he dies, having been mortally wounded by the Chief. Immediately after this, Gillian receives a call from his estranged wife Jamie, telling him she is being held in the Kremlin . Gillian and Metal Gear travel to an abandoned church resembling the Kremlin, where they find Jamie being held captive by a scientist named Elijah Modnar, who explains Gillian's past. He, his father and Jamie were involved in a secret experiment taken under by the Soviet Union over 50 years prior during the Cold War to create Snatchers, which were designed to kill and replace world leaders, giving the Soviets more power. Gillian was a CIA agent spying on the project, who married Jamie and had a child with her, Harry Benson. Gillian and Jamie were placed in a cryogenic sleep when Elijah released Lucifer Alpha into the atmosphere. The pair were saved by the army, and lost their memories due to the extended period of time they had been frozen. Having become corrupt with power, Elijah reveals that he intends for the Snatchers to wipe out and replace humanity as proof of mankind's follies he also reveals that Random was an anti Snatcher created by his late father based on Elijah's appearance and memories, and presents his deactivated body. At this point, Random reactivates and holds Elijah at bay, allowing Gillian and Jamie to escape. Metal Gear activates an orbital weapon, which destroys the Snatcher base, killing Elijah and Random. Having learned of a larger Snatcher factory in Moscow, Gillian prepares to embark on a mission there in the hope of finally destroying the Snatcher menace and rekindling his romance with Jamie. Snatcher was created by Hideo Kojima, working for Konami. Heavily influenced by Blade Runner 1982 and other works of cinema, he wanted to develop a game with a similar style. The game was pitched as a cyberpunk adventure . Kojima found it difficult to explain the meaning of cyberpunk to Konami's trademark department over the phone. The game was originally titled Junker, but the name sounded too similar to an existing mahjong game. The title New Order was also considered. Kojima did not like the final name because his previous game, Metal Gear 1987 , was also named after an enemy in the game. Development began between Kojima and character designer Tomiharu Kinoshita, who both treated the project like making a film or anime rather than a game. They expanded to form a small team at Konami, about half the size needed for a typical Famicom game, which allowed them to work closely and quickly. The game is filled with science fiction culture references that skirt copyright laws. Kojima told Kinoshita to make Gillian similar to Katsuhiro Otomo, director of the science fiction film Akira 1988 . The team never aimed for the game to have a mature atmosphere, but it naturally progressed in that direction. In addition to fourth wall breaking dialogue in the game, Kojima wanted to print a secret message and heat activated scent on the floppy disks that could be noticed after warming them up in the disk drive, but Konami did not approve of this idea. After a year and a half, Snatcher was only half completed. Originally Kojima planned six chapters, but was told to trim them down to two. The team wanted to create a third chapter, but were already over the allowed development schedule so were forced to end the game on a cliffhanger. Development took about two to three times longer than the average game. Difficulties with memory constraints prompted the staff to take a break during development, at which time Kojima began to explore concepts for his later game Policenauts 1994 . Originally Snatcher was going to be a PC 8801 exclusive, but it was also developed for the MSX2 at the request of Konami. The PC 8801 version supports FM and stereo sounds via the PC 8801's Sound Board II expansion card while the MSX2 version came with a special cartridge that provided an expanded soundscape beyond the platform's default capabilities and extra RAM, featuring different music track arrangements. The expansion cartridge raised the price of the MSX2 version beyond that of the PC 8801 version, a reverse from the platform's typically cheaper retail game pricing. The quantity of music and sound was greater than other games at the time, and required a larger than usual sound team. Because neither platform was capable of accurately synthesizing speech, sound effects were used to represent character dialogue. Snatcher was released for the PC 8801 on November 26, 1988, and the MSX2 in December that year. Players began asking for a home console version soon after release. Because the game was large and required several floppy disks, only CD ROM systems were considered as opposed to systems that ran ROM cartridges. The PC Engine had the Super CD ROM2 System available so it was chosen to host Snatcher's console port. This port was the first time the development team worked with CD technology. The team added a third act to this version, a decision they were criticized internally for as others believed the game was already long enough. Using CD technology enabled them to add recorded speech and high quality background music. Artist Satoshi Yoshioka created the graphics for this version. Kojima wanted the visuals to appear as cinematic as possible, so Yoshioka pulled inspiration from Blade Runner, The Terminator 1984 , and Alien 1979 to replicate their Hollywood style special effects. He used a custom drawing application by Konami to create the character graphics, including the facial expressions during conversations. He found Gillian's expressions to be the most difficult to animate due to the complexities of his characterization. A trial version called the Pilot Disk was released on August 7, 1992. It covers the beginning of the first act and also contains supplemental content such as character introductions, a preview trailer, and select music tracks. The full version was released on October 23, 1992 and reportedly sold well for a PC Engine game. After releasing its first game on the Sega CD, Lethal Enforcers 1992 , Konami wanted to bring a more interactive experience to the system for Western players. It considered making a game in full motion video like Night Trap 1992 but thought it may be too difficult, and ultimately decided to localize and port Snatcher. This also gave the Snatcher developers an opportunity to improve upon the PC Engine version which they were still not completely satisfied with. Although the Sega CD could only display 64 colors simultaneously compared to the PC Engine's 256 , the team used software techniques to increase this to 112 and modified some of the palettes to compromise. Several scenes were censored or otherwise altered for the Sega CD release. A woman's breasts were covered up, while a 14 year old girl shown standing naked in a shower was now obscured and her age was changed to 18. Some options that allowed Gillian to engage in behaviors related to sexual harassment were removed or toned down, such as those that allowed him to sniff panties or stare at breasts. Audio in which a robot becomes aroused while watching a pornographic film was cut out entirely. The violence was not altered, except for one scene where a partially dead dog with twitching innards was made completely dead with no twitching. Fearing copyright issues in the United States, the clientele in a bar was changed from Kamen Rider, the Alien, and other characters to Konami characters. Feeling that the third act was too movie like, Konami added more interactivity through additional forks and choices. Additionally, the player is now graded on how well they solved the mysteries. Dates of events in the game were also moved up five years to still occur in the near future to compensate for the late release. The game was translated by Scott Hards, with supervision from Jeremy Blaustein and Konami of Japan. The translation took about two to three months. Seven voice actors recorded about two and a half hours of dialogue for 26 different characters. With the large amount of text included in the game, the translation was expensive, and Konami felt it was the most difficult part of the porting process. According to Blaustein, Kojima was not involved with the Sega CD port, likely working on Policenauts at the time. Snatcher was released in December 1994 in Europe and January 1995 in North America. According to Blaustein, it only sold a couple thousand copies in the United States and was ultimately a commercial failure. Its poor sales have been attributed to its late release during the Sega CD's lifespan. Snatcher was released once again in Japan in 1996, this time for 32 bit game consoles. A PlayStation version was released on January 26, followed by a Sega Saturn version on March 29. The PC 8801 and MSX2 versions received positive reviews in Japan and attained a cult following, but were not commercially successful. The PC Engine version also attained a following in Japan in part because of its gore. Famicom Tsushin gave it a 33 out of 40, commending its cinematic quality. The game was still listed on its Reader's Best 20 list two years after release. Sega Saturn Magazine found the Sega Saturn version a faithful port of the PC Engine version. When Snatcher arrived to the west on the Sega CD, it received praise for its story, cinematic presentation, and mature themes. It was more cinematic and told a more mature story than gamers were familiar with at the time. Mean Machines Sega felt Snatcher was more substantial than other adventure games, calling it one of the most involved storyboards and backgrounds of any video game . The game's writing was generally lauded, but VideoGames and Game Players felt its juvenile humor sometimes conflicted from its otherwise serious tone. A reviewer at GameFan called it one of the longest, most involving games he had played in a long time. He wrote Never before have I played nay experienced a game this moving, dramatic, gore riddled, MA 17, adult . The magazine praised Konami for retaining most of the mature content. Mean Machines Sega believed Snatcher's presentation was heightened through the use of CD ROM technology, which supported the digitized voices and high quality graphics. Some critics praised the English voice acting and writing, though Next Generation thought Konami could have contracted better actors. The graphics were criticized by Computer and Video Games as dated and VideoGames as generic . Other magazines discussed the graphics in more positive light. GamePro liked the Japanese anime style graphics and felt that combined with the writing, it drew players into the story. However, its reviewer criticized the music, calling it old fashioned for a cyberpunk adventure , while Mean Machines Sega compared it positively to John Carpenter style incidental themes. Critics felt the game was slow moving at times, but rewarded patient players. GamePro wrote that it rewards patience, persistence, and plodding . Ultimate Future Games felt the game was too linear, and leaned too heavily on the illusion of choice when the story could only be advanced by completing tasks in a certain order. Mean Machines Sega felt the puzzles were challenging and the game was considerably longer and more substantial than Rise of the Dragon 1990 , another cyberpunk adventure game. Computer and Video Games felt the gun shooting sections were weak and disappointing. Snatcher has been called one of the best adventure games and best cyberpunk games of all time. It has continued to receive praise for its story and presentation. Waypoint wrote that its narrative and visuals hold up, in contrast to most Sega CD and cyberpunk adventure games. Kotaku called it a science fiction cornucopia and liked how the game explored topics of human existence and the fear of machines replacing humans. It felt the game was heavily influenced by science fiction films including Blade Runner, The Terminator, Akira, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 . Other publications also picked up on these inspirations, especially that from Blade Runner. Retro Gamer felt it was ironic how the game was more cinematic than games using full motion video. Destructoid enjoyed the plot, but complained about the interface. AllGame wrote that text based menu driven games like Snatcher can become tedious, but felt the storyline and graphics made Snatcher worth its time. Critics have discussed Snatcher as setting the stage for Kojima's later works. 1UP.com felt the game demonstrated his love for film and was more of a cerebral affair than some of other efforts, but his ingenuity and attention to detail helped make this game especially noteworthy . Game Informer wrote that Snatcher foreshadowed Kojima's use of science fiction to explore philosophy, sex, and the human condition in Metal Gear Solid. Snatcher remains one of Kojima's most renowned games, but is often overshadowed by the Metal Gear Solid series. Snatcher has obtained a cult following. It has been an influence on other science fiction works, including Project Itoh's novel Genocidal Organ, and the 2015 adventure game 2064 Read Only Memories. Kojima has expressed interest in reviving Snatcher in some capacity, and has explained he does not have the time to work on the project himself but would welcome another director to lead it. According to him, such a project has never been feasible from a business perspective, and in 2011, said that a sequel would need to sell over half a million copies to make sense financially. Kojima left Konami in 2015, and the game remains a property of the company, which has not expressed interest in reviving it, either through a rerelease or sequel. The game's lack of availability on modern platforms has surprised critics. Some believed it would play well on a Nintendo DS or 3DS, following the footsteps of successful graphic adventures on those platforms like Hotel Dusk and Phoenix Wright. The Sega CD version remains the sole release in Western territories. Demand has driven up the prices on these copies on the secondary market, making emulation a more reasonable option for most players. Japanese copies are far cheaper but the game's text based nature makes it difficult for non Japanese readers. The Japanese PC Engine version will be included in the TurboGrafx 16 Mini. Fans have experimented with porting the game to other systems. A demo of an early part of the game was made for the Virtual Boy in 2015, complete with stereoscopic 3D effects and PCM music. Another fan experimented with porting it to the Dreamcast with a remixed soundtrack and retouched visuals. Snatcher was the first translation project for Jeremy Blaustein, who went on to translate Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 1998 . Blaustein launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for a steampunk adventure game titled Blackmore in 2014. The game was to be directed by Blaustein with former Snatcher staff making up other parts of the team. It did not meet its funding goal. Snatcher was remade into a role playing game called SD Snatcher for the MSX2, released in 1990. SD stands for super deformed in Japanese media, another way to reference chibi character designs. The game plays from a top down perspective, where the player controls Gillian as he ventures through the environment. When the player encounters an enemy on the field, the game shifts to a first person battle mode. The player must shoot down enemies using one of many different guns. Different parts of an enemy can be targeted and different weapons have varying abilities and ranges. Outside of key plot points, the game significantly changes the locations explored and events which transpired in the original. This game also concludes the story in a similar manner to the CD ROM versions. Like the MSX2 version of Snatcher, SD Snatcher shipped with the expanded sound cartridge. It was translated by the Dutch based group Oasis in 1993, making it one of the earliest documented fan translations. An episodic radio drama prequel, Sdatcher, was released in 2011 through a collaboration between Kojima and game designer Goichi Suda. Suda credited Snatcher, along with works by Yu Suzuki, for igniting his interest in video games. He asked Kojima if he wanted to make a new game together, and the project lead to a radio drama. It was announced in 2007. The script was written by Suda, and the music was composed by Akira Yamaoka, who worked for Suda in his Grasshopper Manufacture studio and worked on the Silent Hill series. Original Snatcher artist Satoshi Yoshioka did promotional illustrations. The first act was released in September with new acts released every other week through November that year. It was distributed for free and later sold on CDs. It was later translated by fans.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29
"Sneak King is a video game by Burger King for the Xbox and Xbox 360 video game consoles, released in 2006. Burger King sold the game with the purchase of value meals. Players take control of Burger King's mascot The King, in a stealth food delivery themed game that spans four levels based on Burger King's commercial advertisements. Sneak King is one of three titles released by Burger King under the name King Games and developed by Blitz Games as part of five week promotional campaign between November 19 and December 24, 2006. Blitz Games was chosen to develop the games, originally for the online Xbox Live Arcade, but this was later changed to a single disc that would run the game on both the Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles. Development of the project was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak King's development was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile based puzzle video game, but became a Spy vs Spy style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would attribute the three game project as being the driving force behind the company's 40 quarterly sales increase. The player takes control of The King, the mascot for Burger King, who is tasked with sneaking around while delivering 4 different types of Burger King meals to hungry people. Sneak King's gameplay consists of four levels to explore the Saw Mill, Cul De Sac, Construction Zone, and Downtown. Each level features a unique map with 20 challenges to be completed. There are two game modes, free play mode and challenge mode. Free play mode occurs whenever the player is not currently undertaking a challenge or after the player changes levels. In this mode, the player can freely explore the area without noise or sight detection and use the minimap to see unlocked challenges and non player characters NPCs . In Challenge mode, the player must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is indicated above thought bubbles which float above the heads of the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version. The origin of three Burger King themed Xbox Games, including Sneak King, began when senior executives from Microsoft and Burger King met at Cannes to accept awards for their I Love Bees and Subservient Chicken advertising campaigns. Microsoft and Burger King's executives decided to produce Xbox games that would take place in Burger King themed context that would not be reduced to blatant advertisements. Blitz Games Studios would become involved in the project after Blitz Games Studios' co founder, Philip Oliver, discussed an interest in producing Xbox Live games with Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade portfolio manager, Ross Erickson. Oliver's interest was hampered by a lack of funding, but Erickson agreed to notify Oliver of any leads on advertisers looking for product placement. A week or two after that, Oliver received a call from Erickson about Burger King's interest in creating three games. In the fall of 2005, Blitz Games entered into talks with Burger King and the development began in February 2006. The development originally began as downloadable Xbox Live games, but Burger King soon announced that they wanted the games to also be playable on the Xbox. This would require distribution of the games in boxes instead of digitally because original Xbox console platform was not able to access Xbox Live Arcade. With physical distribution in mind, Burger King wanted both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game to be available on the same disc. For the project, Blitz Games assigned two project managers for the games, Chris Swan and John Jarvis. Swan and Jarvis held daily conference calls with Burger King and Microsoft's Xbox division throughout the development period. In order to better work together, Blitz Games showed Burger King the development process for a previous game, from first the black and white sketches, then the color concepts, environment blockouts, texturing and lighting, and finally the results on screen. By showing an example of their workflow process, Blitz Games hoped to bridge the presentation gap between the companies could potentially cripple the project. Originally Blitz Games had a staff of fifteen working on the original project, but this grew to nearly 80 people after Burger King increased the contract and budget for the games. The task of producing two different versions of the games were made easier by Blitz Games' production toolchain, which had built in compatibility for Xbox. Blitz Studios' developers were able to adjust the game with appropriate hardware coding that had already been previously developed by the company. Blitz Games extended their development cycle by two months one month due to challenges in production, and the other because Microsoft agreed to fast track the games through the Quality Assurance process. The development period concluded after three months, with the completion of all three games and the production of two million units of each game. Burger King and Blitz Studios split the creative process up for the three games. Sneak King is the game that Burger King had creative control over, and which was envisioned based on the King commercials. Oliver stated, Sneak King is derived by them, purely from their commercials. It was basically 'here's our commercials, we have to have a video game around them.' They threw in all their ideas, and we made it work. Originally, Sneak King was designed as a tile based puzzle game, but it soon evolved into a Spy vs Spy caper with multiple Kings who are trying to out deliver one another while laying traps for their enemies . Burger King's creative control over the game impacted its development defined as a set of rules. The first rule was that there was only one King character. In response, the developers had the idea of the Xbox avatars playing the game and finding the crown to become the King. This idea was rejected by Burger King who said players could not become the King. The developers' next idea was to have one person be the King and the other players lay traps to interfere with his deliveries, but this idea was again rejected by Burger King because the King could not be exposed to any danger. With the usual hazards and competition elements of the video games removed, the developers decided upon a stealth format with no human opponents. In order to better capture the accuracy and authenticity of the King's movements, the King was flown to Britain for motion capture for the game's production. Blitz Games' Edward Linley described Sneak King as the riskiest game concept of the project because it is the appearance and antics of the King himself that give the game its humor and life without him, the game simply wouldn't work. Until we had the finished King model and motion capture in the game, we couldn't be certain the concept would gel. Fortunately, the moment he went in, we knew we had created something truly unique. Sneak King's programming code consists of 60,000 active lines with another 43,000 developer comment lines. Sneak King is one of three promotional Burger King themed games, released in North America Q4 2006. The other two games are Pocketbike Racer and Big Bumpin'. The Burger King marketing run was from November 19 through December 24, 2006. The games were available for 3.99 with any purchase of any Burger King value meal. In January 2007, the marketing firm Crispin Porter Bogusky stated that more than 2.7 million games were sold in the promotion. It was reported that more than 3.2 million copies were sold, although Sneak King distinct sales were not given, in Game Developer's April 2007 issue. GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann gave it a 5.8 out of 10 and although describing it as weird and poorly made, he concluded that Sneak King is a one trick pony that is an interesting curiosity with a subversive sense of humor. IGN's Brudvig noted that the game's US 3.99 price point made it the cheapest Xbox Live game. Although noting the presence of game breaking bugs, he said the budget game was worth purchasing because of its food delivery dances. Brudvig also noted that the graphics were impressive for the cost of the game, but the interactive maps were found to be quite limited and environmentally sparse. X Play rated the game as one out of five, but noted that his is the game that really got the buzz going about BK's whole foray into gaming, thanks mostly to screenshots of the Burger King hiding in a garbage can, lying in wait for what appeared to be a college age woman walking toward him. Stalking in the name of great taste. Kate Macarthur of Advertising Age noted that, Burger King's Sneak King video game for Xbox may not have won rave reviews, but gamers still bought more than 2 million copies. The immediate impact of Sneak King on Blitz Games was a financial boost. This allowed the company to improve its technology, and partially funded the company's Blitz Arcade. Collectively, sales sufficed to be ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Story wrote, Using Xbox data on game use, the Burger King game equates in time spent to more than 1.4 billion 30 second commercials . Including Sneak King, the success of the project was noted as a key part of Burger King's 40 increase in sales during the quarter. It was affirmed by Russell Klein that Burger King attributed the majority of that success to the game project.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneak%20King
"Boris Vasilievich Snetkov Russian 27 February 1925 18 September 2006 was a Soviet Army and briefly Russian Ground Forces Army General. Snetkov fought in World War II as a self propelled artillery officer and during the Cold War rose to command positions. He commanded the 1st Guards Tank Army and served as first deputy commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany during the 1970s. Snetkov led the Siberian Military District and the Leningrad Military District in the 1980s and in 1987 became commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany GSFG , which in 1989 became the Western Group of Forces as the Cold War wound down. Snetkov was removed from command of the group in December 1990 and transferred to the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, before retiring in 1992. Snetkov was born on 27 February 1925 in Saratov, and graduated from Pugachyov's School No. 2. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1942 and in October 1943 graduated from accelerated courses at the 2nd Kiev Self Propelled Artillery School as a junior lieutenant. As commander of an SU 152 self propelled gun in the 9th Separate Guards Breakthrough Tank Regiment of the 1st Ukrainian Front's 38th Army, Snetkov saw his first combat west of Rozhiv in the Battle of Kiev on 25 November, during which his crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a Tiger tank and two guns. For his actions, Snetkov received the Order of the Red Star on 12 December. As the advance westwards across Ukraine continued into the winter, he and his regiment fought in the ZhitomirBerdichev Offensive and the Korsun Shevchenkovsky Offensive as part of the 38th Army. During the latter operation, on 26 January, his crew was reported by a superior to have engaged a German tank column of about 20 tanks and destroyed three, one of which was a Tiger, on the LipovetsRososhe road. For this action, Snetkov received the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, on 2 February. In February 1944, his regiment was withdrawn from the front and converted into the 395th Guards Heavy Self Propelled Artillery Regiment. It was also reequipped with the updated ISU 152 self propelled gun, one of which Snetkov became commander of. Snetkov and his regiment did not return to the front until June 1944, where they became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. He was promoted to lieutenant around this time, and from late June, he fought in Operation Bagration, the Soviet strategic offensive that recaptured Belarus and eastern Poland. Between 22 and 27 June, during fighting in the Bogushevsk area, Snetkov's crew was reported by a superior to have destroyed a self propelled gun, two bunkers, and two anti tank guns. For this he received a second Order of the Red Star on 10 July. The regiment, as part of the front, fought in the Baltic Offensive and the Gumbinnen Operation during the fall. Snetkov became adjutant to the regimental commander, and was promoted to Senior Lieutenant. From January 1945, the 395th Guards Heavy Self Propelled Artillery Regiment fought in the East Prussian Offensive. According to a report made by his regimental commander, Snetkov helped coordinate the entry of self propelled guns into battle and often personally visited the front lines under heavy fire to pass on orders between 13 and 21 January. On 15 January, the 2nd Battery commander's radio malfunctioned, leading to the battery getting lost. Despite heavy German mortar fire, Snetkov was able to pass on orders to the battery, allowing it to fulfil its mission. For these actions, he received the Medal For Courage on 20 February. The regiment fought in the Battle of Konigsberg and the Samland Offensive in the last weeks of the war. Between 23 and 25 April in fighting around Pillau, Snetkov's battery destroyed a self propelled gun, 9 guns, 8 bunkers, a mortar battery, and 15 machine gun positions. For this action, he received the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd class, on 6 May. After the end of the war in Europe, the 395th Guards Heavy Self Propelled Artillery Regiment was transferred to the Far East for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit. Between 1946 and 1950, Snetkov was assistant chief of staff for operations of a regiment, and then entered the Military Academy of the Armored Forces, graduating in 1953. Until 1965, he successively served as a regimental chief of staff, chief of a division's operations staff department, and commander of a tank regiment. Between 1965 and 1966 Snetkov was chief of staff of a division, and in 1968 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating, Snetkov took command of a tank division in the Kiev Military District, and in May 1971 transferred to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany GSFG as chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 3rd Shock Army. He was promoted to major general in 1972, and would serve in the GSFG for the better part of the decade. He was appointed commander of the 1st Guards Tank Army in August 1973, after which he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1974, and became First Deputy Commander in July 1975. He left East Germany to command the Siberian Military District in January 1979, and was promoted to colonel general that year, moving westwards again to lead the Leningrad Military District in November 1981. On 7 May 1986, Snetkov was promoted to army general. In November 1987, Snetkov was appointed commander of the GSFG, which became the Western Group of Forces WGF in June 1989 when it was shifted to a defensive role. During upheavals in East Germany during October and November, the WGF's troops did not intervene in the Leipzig Monday demonstrations and the Fall of the Berlin Wall as a result of orders given to Snetkov by the Soviet ambassador in East Germany, Vyacheslav Kochemasov, which were confirmed by the Soviet government. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the easing of Cold War tensions, discipline in the WGF began to break down. In response to charges of fatal recruit abuse, widespread desertion, and weapons smuggling among Soviet troops, Snetkov held a November 1990 press conference to deny the charges, in which he stated that only 84 soldiers had died in 1990, mostly in training or traffic accidents that 83 soldiers had left units without permission and denied allegations weapons smuggling, stating that only seven weapons were missing . In response to German citizens' complaints, he also halted all training on weekends and holidays, and ended low level flying over populated places. In December, after former East German leader Erich Honecker was issued an arrest warrant by prosecutors in Berlin and charged with giving orders to fire on escapees, Snetkov refused to hand over Honecker, who was under Soviet protection at a military hospital. He opposed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, and stated in multiple early 2000s interviews with Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that his opposition to a Soviet pull out was the reason for his dismissal from command of the WGF later that month. However, according to a contemporary Izvestia report, he was fired along with deputies after the desertions of a regimental commander and a supply unit leader on 29 November, who took two missiles, three tank shells and other armaments with them. After his dismissal, Snetkov joined the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, traditionally a pre retirement post for elderly generals. He retired in May 1992 after the elimination of the Group of Inspectors General. Snetkov lived in Moscow and died there on 18 September 2006. He was buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery. Snetkov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1945 and was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at its tenth and eleventh convocations, which lasted from 1979 to 1989. He was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party between 1986 and 1990. During the March 1989 Soviet Union legislative election, the first relatively free Soviet elections, Snetkov, who was backed by the Communist Party, lost his seat, which represented a district in Yaroslavl, to reformist Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Podziruk, in a campaign focused on the issue of the existence of the Soviet draft. Snetkov married Aleksandra Ivanovna, who died 2011, and had a son, Vladislav Borisovich Snetkov, who also became an army officer, and who died in 1997. Snetkov was awarded the following decorations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris%20Snetkov
"Honora Edgeworth nee Sneyd 1751 1 May 1780 was an eighteenth century English writer, mainly known for her associations with literary figures of the day particularly Anna Seward and the Lunar Society, and for her work on children's education. Sneyd was born in Bath in 1751, and following the death of her mother in 1756 was raised by Canon Thomas Seward and his wife Elizabeth in Lichfield, Staffordshire until she returned to her father's house in 1771. There, she formed a close friendship with their daughter, Anna Seward. Having had a romantic engagement to John Andre and having declined the hand of Thomas Day, she married Richard Edgeworth as his second wife in 1773, living on the family estate in Ireland till 1776. There she helped raise his children from his first marriage, including Maria Edgeworth, and two children of her own. Returning to England she fell ill with tuberculosis, which was incurable, dying at Weston in Staffordshire in 1780. She is the subject of a number of Anna Seward's poems, and with her husband developed concepts of childhood education, resulting in a series of books, such as Practical Education, based on her observations of the Edgeworth children. She is known for her stand on women's rights through her vigorous rejection of the proposal by Day, in which she outlined her views on equality in marriage. Honora Sneyd was born the third daughter to Edward Sneyd who lived in Bishton, Staffordshire and Susanna Cook of Sible Hedingham, Essex, in Bath in 1751. Her father was a Major in the Royal Horse Guards, with an appointment at Court as a Gentleman Usher. her parents married in 1742 and she was one of eight children and the second surviving daughter of six, and only six years old when her mother died in 1757. Her father found himself unable to take care of all of his children and various friends and relations then offered to take them in. Honora Sneyd, who was seven years younger than the thirteen year old Anna Seward, moved into the home of family friends, Canon Thomas Seward and his wife Elizabeth and their family at Lichfield, Staffordshire, where they lived in the Bishop's Palace in the Cathedral Close. The Sewards had lost five children after their first two daughters, and such fostering was not uncommon at the time. There she was brought up by the Sewards as one of their own, being variously described as an adopted or foster sister. Anna Seward describes how she and her younger sister Sarah first met Honora, on returning from a walk, in her poem The Anniversary 1769 . Initially Honora was more attached to Sarah, to whom she was closer in age, but Sarah died of typhus at the age of nineteen 1764 , when Honora Sneyd was thirteen. Following Sarah's death Honora became the responsibility of Anna, the older sister. Anna consoled herself with her affection for Honora Sneyd, as she describes in Visions, written a few days after her sister's death. In the poem she expresses the hope that Honora 'this transplanted flower' will replace her sister whom she refers to as 'Alinda' in her and her parents' affections. Throughout her life Honora Sneyd's health was fragile, experiencing the first bout of the tuberculosis that would later claim her life in 1766, at the age of fifteen. However, Anna Seward believed she detected the first signs in 1764, at thirteen, writing presciently This dear child will not live I am perpetually fearing it, notwithstanding the clear health which crimsons her cheek and glitters in her eyes. Such early expansion of intelligence and sensibility partakes too much of the angelic, too little of the mortal nature, to tarry long in these low abodes of frailty and of pain, where the harshness of authority, and the impenetrability of selfishness, with the worse mischiefs of pride and envy, so frequently agitate by their storms, and chill by their damps, the more ingenious and purer spirits, scattered, not profusely, over the earth. At Lichfield Honora Sneyd came under the influence of Canon Seward, who raised her, and his progressive views on female education, which he expressed in his poem The Female Right to Literature 1748 . She was described as clever and interested in science, From Anna she developed a great love of literature. Honora Sneyd was an accomplished scholar, attending day school in Lichfield where she became fluent in French, translating Rousseau's Julie for her older foster sister. Though Canon Seward's but not his wife's attitudes towards the education of girls was progressive relative to the times, they were by no means excessively liberal . Amongst the subjects he taught them were theology and numeracy, and how to read, appreciate, write and recite poetry. Although this deviated from what were considered conventional drawing room accomplishments , he encouraged them away from traditional female roles. However, the omissions were also notable, including languages and science, although they were left free to pursue their own inclinations in this regard. To that end they were exposed to the circle of learned men who frequented the Bishop's Palace at Lichfield where they lived, and which became the centre of a literary circle including, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell. The children were encouraged to participate in the conversations, as Anna later relates. Honora Sneyd and Anna Seward lived under the same roof for thirteen years and formed a close friendship which has given rise to much speculation as to its exact nature, located as it was within the tradition of female friendship , and forming the basis of a body of Anna Seward's poetical works. Various authors differ in their interpretation of the relationship between the two women, with Lillian Faderman who first suggested that it was lesbian, supported by Barrett although the term relates more to twentieth rather than eighteenth century concepts of identity. On the other hand, Teresa Barnard argues against this based more on examination of the correspondence rather than poetry, which is generally based within the lesbian poetic canon, the relationship between these two women being frequently cited. Sneyd had a reputation for both intelligence and beauty, as commented on by many, including Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth see below . In 1764 Seward described Sneyd as fresh and beautiful as the young day star, when he bathes his fair beams in the dews of spring . At seventeen Honora Sneyd was briefly engaged to a Swiss born Derbyshire merchant, John Andre, a relationship that Seward had fostered, and wrote about in her Monody on Major Andre 1781 when Andre became a British officer in 1771 and was hanged as a spy by the Americans. The respective parents did not support this attachment for reasons of his financial status. Around Christmas 1770, Thomas Day and Richard Edgeworth, who like Thomas Seward were members of the Lunar Society that met in Lichfield amongst other places, were spending increasing amounts of time at the Seward household and both had fallen for Sneyd, although Edgeworth was already married. In 1771 she declined an offer of marriage from Thomas Day. Edgeworth gives an account of her letter of rejection stating that it contained an excellent answer to his Day's arguments in favour of the rights of men, and a clear dispassionate view of the rights of women . Edgeworth continues that Sneyd had very determined views on the role of women and their rights within marriage. Miss Honora Sneyd would not admit the unqualified control of a husband over all her actions she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, that she would not change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her. However, Honora Sneyd's father moved to Lichfield from London in 1771, and reassembled his family of five daughters there. By now Honora was nineteen and Anna viewed her friend's departure with considerable dismay. Although Day was much distressed by his rejection by Honora Sneyd, he transferred his affections to the fifth daughter, Elizabeth Sneyd, who had been in the care of Mr Henry Powys and his wife, Susannah Sneyd, of the Abbey, Shrewsbury, Mrs. Powys being Mr Sneyd's niece. However, Elizabeth Sneyd was not inclined to accept Day. Richard Edgeworth comments on how Honora Sneyd had affected him During this intercourse I perceived the superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said. I was six and twenty and now for the first time in my life I saw a woman that equalled the picture of perfection which existed in my imagination. He continued, describing the unhappiness of his marriage, and how that made him vulnerable to her attributes, which were shared by all the learned gentlemen of his circle. He also believed that Anna Seward had noticed the effect her friend was having on him, and would regularly place her actions in the best light for his benefit. The elimination of Day as a suitor for Honora Sneyd's hand placed Edgeworth in a difficult situation and he resolved to end it by moving to Lyons France, to work, in the autumn of 1771. On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's first wife Anna Maria Elers gave birth to their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, at the age of 29. Ten days later she died from puerperal fever. Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his expectant wife in the care of Day. On learning of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and there was no mention of the conventional waiting period before remarrying after widowhood. Although Mr. Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland. Through this marriage Sneyd became step mother to Edgeworth's four surviving children by his first wife, Anna Maria, ranging from seven months to nine years in age Richard, Maria, who became a writer in her own right, Emmeline and Anna Maria. On encountering her new family she observed that Maria, then aged five, was exhibiting behavioural problems, and expressed her views that speedy and consistent punishment were the keys to ensuring good behaviour in children, a view she proceeded to practice. However, she believed that such discipline needed to be imposed before the age of 5 or 6 , and was therefore rather late in the case of the older children however, she imposed a strict discipline. Following a period of ill health on Sneyd's part, Maria Edgeworth was sent away to boarding school in Derby 17751781 , and later London upon the death of Honora Sneyd 17811782 . Similarly, her older brother Richard was sent to Charterhouse 17761778 and then went to sea, and she never saw him again. Later Richard Edgeworth would comment on how difficult the first two years were for Sneyd in her new role as stepmother to undisciplined children, a role her relatives had advised her against. Honora Sneyd was soon pregnant, giving birth to her daughter Honora on 30 May 1774, who died at the age of sixteen. Her second child, Lovell, who inherited the property, was born the following year on 30 June 1775. The Edgeworth children were raised according to the system of Rousseau, as refined and modified by the Edgeworths. Richard Edgeworth considered his early educational efforts a failure, the older children from his first marriage growing up unruly and then being sent away to school, and readily concurred with his new wife's stricter rules. However, he had seen very little of them in their early years. After three years in Ireland, in 1776 they moved to England again, taking up residence in Northchurch, Hertfordshire Despite Anna Seward's despair at the loss of her friend, she and Honora had maintained regular correspondence and visits. However, these suddenly ceased, an event that Anna blamed Honora Sneyd's father for. During a temporary absence of Edgeworth on business in Ireland in the spring of 1779, Honora Sneyd fell ill with a fever, just as he was summoning her to let the house and join him there. On his return they consulted Dr. Erasmus Darwin at Lichfield, who was of the opinion the illness was more severe than at first thought, being a recurrence of consumption T.B. from which she had had a brief bout at the age of fifteen. He advised against returning to Ireland but rather, moving closer to Lichfield. For a while they stayed at the Sneyd house that was temporarily vacant while consulting a wide range of physicians including Dr. William Heberden Samuel Johnson's physician , and even staying with Day near London to be close to medical care. but only received news of incurability. Eventually they rented Bighterton, near Shifnal, Shropshire, closer to the Sneyds, Darwin and others of their circle, where Honora Sneyd drew up her will in April. Four years after returning to England Honora Sneyd died of consumption at six in the morning on 1 May 1780 at Bighterton, surrounded by her husband, her youngest sister, Charlotte and a servant. Honora Sneyd was buried in the nearby Weston church where a plaque on the wall see box bears witness to her life. Honora Sneyd died within eight years of her marriage to Richard Edgeworth, at almost the same age as her predecessor. The same disease which had taken the life of her mother and five maternal aunts would soon claim the life of her young daughter, Honora Edgeworth 1790 , as well as her younger sister, Elizabeth, seven years later 1797 , as well as at least two of Elizabeth's children, Charlotte 1807 and Henry 1813 . Honora's brother, Lovell was also affected by the consumption. At the time it was thought this was a hereditary weakness carried by the family. On Honora Sneyd's death, Edgeworth married her younger sister, Elizabeth Sneyd, stating that this had been the dying wish of Honora. Uglow speculates that this was a marriage of convenience, for the sake of the children. Although it was technically legal to marry one's wife's sister, the marriage was considered scandalous, and was opposed by the Sneyds, Sewards and Edgeworths as well as the Bishop. The couple fled to London where they were married on Christmas Day with Thomas Day as witness, before proceeding to live at Northchurch. The scandal may have given rise to less charitable interpretations of Edgeworth's actions, although there is no direct evidence to support or refute these. Honora Sneyd's will, drawn up during the last month of her life refers only to that Woman whom he shall think worthy to call his, for her to wear, so long as they both shall LOVE , referring to a cameo she owned of Richard Edgeworth. The Edgeworths jointly developed the concept of Practical Education , a principle that would become a new paradigm by the 1820s. Having determined that after eight years, Richard Edgeworth's attempt to raise his eldest son Richard according to the principles of Rousseau was a failure, he and Honora were determined to find better methods. After the birth of Honora's first child 1774 , the Edgeworths embarked on a plan, partly inspired by Anna Barbauld, to write a series of books for children. After trying many other methods, Barbauld's Lessons for Children from two to three years old was published in 1778, and the Edgeworths used it on Anna 5 and Honora 4 , and were delighted to find that the girls learned to read in six weeks. Now back in England, at Northchurch the Edgeworths were in closer contact with the intellectuals of the Lunar society. Richard Edgeworth and Honora were determined to design a plan for the education of their children. They started by reviewing the existing literature on childhood education including Locke, Hartley, Priestley in addition to Rousseau , and then proceeded to document their observations of the behaviour of children and then developed their own practical system. To this end Erasmus Darwin suggested they start by reading the work of Dugald Stewart. Honora Sneyd then started recording extensive notes on her observations of the Edgeworth children. These then became the dialogues in the final book. Richard and Maria Edgeworth state that She was of opinion that the art of education should be considered as an experimental science , and that the failures of the past were due to following theory rather than practice . Richard Edgeworth and Honora then set about applying the emerging principles of educational psychology to the actual practice of education. From their reading of theory they determined that the reason Barbauld was successful was that the child's reading was rewarded thus departing radically from Rousseau , because it was associated with pleasure. Honora Sneyd conceived of the title of their work therefore as Practical Education. With her husband, Honora wrote the first version of Practical Education as a children's book Practical education or, the history of Harry and Lucy for Honora her daughter, which was begun in 1778 and privately published in February 1780 in Lichfield as Practical Education, vol 2. The book tells a simple story of two parents and their two model children, Harry and Lucy, who carry out domestic chores and ask their parents many questions, the answers to which may be deemed educational. The children explain their discoveries and how they learn, the whole presented as nine forms of learning. As originally conceived it was intended to be the second part of a series of three books, but the remaining parts remained unwritten. The original plan had been for a collaborative work, contributed to by various members of the Lunar Society. it was an ambitious project designed to fill what they perceived of as major deficiencies in the field of both technical and scientific education and to introduce early ideas on morality, science and other academic disciplines into the developing mind of the young child. After Honora Sneyd's premature death, her sister Elizabeth continued the work, in her role as the third wife of Richard Edgeworth. The final version of the book was authored by Richard and Maria Edgeworth and published after both Honora and her sister Elizabeth's deaths, in 1798, and further revised under Maria's name as Early lessons 18011825 . In reality this was a family project contributed to by a number of their members that would extend over 50 years, beyond Richard Edgeworth's death in 1817 c. 17741825 . Richard Edgeworth observed on his wife's death that being familiar with the experimental method in science, she was surprised to find that educational theory was based on very little empirical evidence, and set out to apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register 2 volumes 17781779 of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children asked, what they did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in Practical Education . This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education 1809 . In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children. Honora Sneyd, through her early contact with members of the Lunar Society, had always taken a keen interest in science, an attribute that drew the intention of Richard Edgeworth who considered himself an inventor. Following their marriage, she worked on his projects with him and in his words, became an excellent theoretic mechanick herself. Since little of Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our image of her is largely through the eyes of others, in particular Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her has been used as a symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship. From growing up in the Seward household with Canon Seward and the members of the Lunar Society, Honora Sneyd and her childhood friend Anna Seward developed relatively progressive views for the times on the status of women and equality in marriage, a key to which was female education. Sneyd entered into marriage with Richard Edgeworth on the understanding that they were equal partners in his work. Anna, and later Honora's stepdaughter, Maria Edgeworth, were to take those values and promote them in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Britain, the ancestors of modern feminists. Today Honora's position on women's rights is best remembered for her rebuke of Thomas Day and his theory of the perfect wife . Anna Seward's will mentions two likenesses of Honora Sneyd in her possession that she wished to bequeath. The first of these was a mezzotinto engraving after George Romney, which she had modeled for as Serena see Figure, above to Honora's brother Edward. The other was a drawn miniature portrait by John Andre 1776 which she left to her cousin and confidante Mary Powys. A jasper medallion, after an image by John Flaxman, was issued by the Wedgwood factory in 1780 right . Honora Sneyd was the subject of many of Seward's poems, When Sneyd married Edgeworth, she became the subject of Seward's anger, yet the latter continued to write about Sneyd and her affection for her long after her death. In addition to being immortalised in Anna Seward's poetry, Sneyd appears semi fictionalised as a character in a play about Major Andre and herself, Andre a Tragedy in Five Acts by William Dunlap, first produced in New York in 1798. The plaque in St. Andrew's Church, Weston, where she is buried, on the north wall of the tower, reads MDCCLXXX Near this place was buried HONORA EDGEWORTH, aged 28 years. Her Manners, Wisdom, and Virtue, gained Admiration and Esteem, without exciting Envy.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honora%20Sneyd
"Sniper Wolf Japanese , Hepburn Sunaipa Urufu' is a fictional character from Konami's Metal Gear series. Created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa, she appears in the 1998 stealth game Metal Gear Solid as well as its 2004 remake, Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes as one of the game bosses opposing the protagonist Solid Snake and his ally Meryl Silverburgh. The character is a ruthless and skilled sniper belonging to the renegade U.S. military special operations group FOXHOUND. Sniper Wolf is a nom de guerre pseudonym and her real name is undisclosed. She is of Iraqi Kurdish origin and her backstory is connected to the series' chief protagonist antagonist character Big Boss, who had rescued her in Iraq when she was a child. Sniper Wolf is widely regarded as one of the most popular and memorable characters in this game as well as in the entire Metal Gear series, as well as one of the top female antagonists in all video gaming. In Metal Gear Solid, Sniper Wolf is a member of FOXHOUND and an elite sniper capable of going without food and staying still for up to a week. She typically forms an emotional connection with her targets before killing them with her favoured weapon, the Heckler Koch PSG1, and uses mercury tipped hollow point bullets to poison her victims. She is also addicted to the drug diazepam. Born in the Iraqi Kurdistan in 1983 during the IranIraq War, she witnessed the death of her family and thousands of others from a chemical attack by Saddam Hussein's government troops against the rebellious Kurds when she was five years old. She was captured by Saddam's forces and taken as an orphan by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, who brainwashed her and brought a famed Gurkha sniper to train her to be a child combatant for the government. Three years later, during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, she fled to a Kurdish refugee camp. There, the legendary U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Big Boss noticed her extraordinary abilities and brought her with him to the United States, where she received counselling and deprogramming to remove her Iraqi brainwashing, leaving only her fighting abilities with her. Extremely grateful, she thought of Big Boss as a modern Saladin and followed him in whatever he did, until his mutiny and later death at the hands of FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake as depicted in Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake . She was then found by Solid Snake's brother Liquid Snake, who convinced her to join a FOXHOUND splinter cell under his command. In the alternate year 2005, during the Shadow Moses Island incident Metal Gear Solid , Sniper Wolf goes rogue along with the rest of Liquid Snake's group when they take hostages and blackmail the U.S. government with a hijacked walking tank armed with nuclear weapons, demanding the corpse of Big Boss to be handed over to them. She cares for the huskies that Liquid intended to kill, as she enjoys their company, and is impressed with the hostage scientist Hal Otacon Emmerich giving his scarce food supply to the dogs. When Solid Snake further referred to as Snake infiltrates the island, Sniper Wolf wounds Snake's companion Meryl Silverburgh to lure him into a trap, capturing him so he could be tortured by another FOXHOUND member, Revolver Ocelot. Eventually, Snake defeats her in sniper duel in a snowy field by shooting her in the lung. After hearing Sniper Wolf's story of her life, and at her request to be at last set free , Snake kills her over objections by Otacon, who professes his love for her. Solid Snake also uses her handkerchief to avoid attacks by her wolves by masking his scent with hers. Sniper Wolf's ghost can be seen if the player uses the in game photo camera on her body. Sniper Wolf was originally planned to make a voice over cameo appearance in Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty 2001 , during a conversation between Otacon and Olga Ninja Gurlukovich, and appears in a short flashback sequence. Her spirit shows up as a wolf in Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots 2008 , in which an unrelated character named Crying Wolf also appears to engage in a sniper duel against Solid Snake. Sniper Wolf's costume can also be developed for the character Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain. A special Sniper Wolf character card appears in the non canon spin off game Metal Gear Acid 2 2005 . Some other developers have also given homage type nods to the character, such as with an item MGS Sniper Wulf Mk. II in EA Montreal's Army of Two 2008 and a weapon MG S1 Sniper Wolfe in the PlayStation 3 version of Visceral Games' The Godfather II 2009 . A 1 8 scale Sniper Wolf action figure was released by McFarlane Toys in 1998. Two 1 6 scale figures were also released only in Japan by Yamato an action figure and Studio Saru Bunshitsu a garage kit . In 2012, Sniper Wolf was chosen by Konami as one of their 64 iconic characters to participate in the Konami E3 Battle event, where she lost against Metal Gear REX in the semi final fourth round. A bishoujo statue designed by Shunya Yamashita based on Shinkawa's original picture was released by Kotobukiya in 2016. According to the Metal Gear series character artist Yoji Shinkawa, the idea of creating Sniper Wolf came about when the series' writer, director and producer Hideo Kojima originally asked him to draw a guy , but Shinkawa suggested that he should instead design a young lady with a sniper rifle. Shinkawa designed her with green hair, but she appears as a sandy blonde in the game he also made a topless picture of her. Kojima said a part of an inspiration for the character came from the female Viet Cong sniper scene in the film Full Metal Jacket and recalled he had a hard time trying to explain the concept of MGS' Sniper Wolf battle to his staff. One of her lines is also a direct quote from the film Blue Velvet. Asked about his favorite Metal Gear character in a 2003 interview, Solid Snake's voice actor David Hayter said Wolf. Very hot. Very dangerous. Shed be Snakes girl if she wasnt so focused on killing him. When he was asked in 2014 about his favourite Metal Gear moments, Kojima himself chose Wolf's death as the first scene to talk about. In 2019, Jordan Vogt Roberts showed a concept art of Sniper Wolf's death scene while announcing his potential Metal Gear Solid film adaptation. He wrote Metal Gear is unique for the sorrow loss you feel while 'winning'. The death of Sniper Wolf rocked me when I first experienced it. I wanted to capture that melancholy victory. The character was well received in part because of her sex appeal. For that reason, Sniper Wolf ranked as 37th hottest babe in games by GameDaily in 2008 and was included in UGO's list of the 50 hottest babes in games in 2011. She was ranked as the tenth sexiest PlayStation character by PlayStation Universe in 2010, who added that this character takes a special place in our hearts, and in 2014 was included among the top 10 hottest female villains in gaming and old school hotties that still got it by Cheat Code Central's Travis Huber, who stated that she was so loved and talked about that Hideo Kojima and the gang have had to create yet another beautiful but deadly sniper character in the upcoming MGSV The Phantom Pain. IGN PlayStation Team in 2008 Sniper Wolf was also acclaimed as one of the best boss type and antagonist characters in the Metal Gear series or even in all video games. In 2006, Ryan Stewart and Rich Krpata of The Boston Phoenix ranked the fight against Sniper Wolf as the 16th greatest boss battle in video game history, describing her as the best aspect of FOXHOUND and her death as one of gaming's most poignant scenes. In 2008, readers of IGN voted her at the top position on the list of the Metal Gear series villains, the staff commenting Who else could number one be but the incredibly beautiful, and impossibly deadly, Sniper Wolf and adding that it's safe to say Wolf earned more votes than just about every other villain combined, a fact that doesn't surprise us at all. That same year, IGN PlayStation Team ranked the fight against her as the sixth best boss battle in the series, while the staff of GameSpy placed her seventh on their list. In 2010, the staff of IGN ranked Sniper Wolf as the 92nd top video game villain of all time, stating that she probably deserves to be higher on our list and emphasizing the feeling of helplessness caused by her tactics in an epic boss battle . In 2015, she was included on several lists of the best boss fights in the Metal Gear series, including by Sean Garmer of 411mania, Dustin Spino of Cinelinx, and the staff of IGN, chosen by Zach Ryan. Regarding her personality issues, sometimes perceived as complicated, Sniper Wolf was ranked as the 25th top chick behaving badly in all entertainment by IGN's Scott Collura in 2008, featured as one of nine bad girls of videogame land by Gelo Gonzales of FHM in 2009, and ranked as the seventh top bitch in games by Gavin Mackenzie of PLAY in 2010. Complex ranked her as the ninth most diabolical video game she villain in 2011, describing her as the exact type of woman that you wouldnt marry for any rational reason. In 2012, Complex ranked her as ninth on the list of some of the most evil women in video games, commenting that even as Sniper Wolf actually ends up being one of the more noble villains in the game, she did exhibit some next level psycho behavior. The scene of Sniper Wolf wounding Meryl to set a trap for Snake was included among the top ten cutscenes in the Metal Gear series by Jeremy M. Loss of Joystick Division in 2010 and ranked as the seventh most shocking surprise in video games subverting the power fantasy by George Reith of GamingBolt in 2012. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole noted how the brillantly manipulative Metal Gear Solid can make the player feel guilty, even as it makes no sense to wish that you hadn't killed Sniper Wolf that is, properly to regret your actions because it is a task that the game demands be fulfilled before you can progress. In 2012, Ryan King of PLAY included the character of Sniper Wolf among the six things you didnt want to kill but you did anyway and Ian Dransfield from the same magazine included her among the top bad guys you wanted to win . In 2015, Aleksander Gilyadov from VentureBeat included Sniper Wolf's death among six most memorable Metal Gear moments opining it still remains as one of the most poignant and beautiful scenes in the entire series. It also displays just how multilayered, benign, and well written Kojimas characters both heroes and villains really are. That same year, Javy Gwaltney from Paste had this scene top his list of the saddest moments in Metal Gear. On the other hand, 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey placed Otacon's reaction to the death of Sniper Wolf second on his 2009 list of the series' most awkward moments, calling it the world's most embarrassingly stupid case of Stockholm syndrome. Shacknews' Steve Watts wrote about the game's GameCube remake Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes While critically acclaimed thanks to its improved graphics and smarter AI, the addition of an MGS2 inspired first person mode was blamed for making the game too easy and ruining the Sniper Wolf boss battle entirely.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper%20Wolf
"Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphereusually within cloudsand then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year to year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. Major snow prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica. Snow affects such human activities as transportation creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear agriculture providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel and warfare. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold. Snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate like, dendritic and stellar shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present. Snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation. Two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake effect also sea effect storms and elevation effects, especially in mountains. Mid latitude cyclones are low pressure areas which are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild snow storms to heavy blizzards. During a hemisphere's fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall. In the Northern Hemisphere, the northern side of the low pressure area produces the most snow. For the southern mid latitudes, the side of a cyclone that produces the most snow is the southern side. A cold front, the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsquallsan intense frontal convective line similar to a rainband , when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles 40 kilometers with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow. A warm front can produce snow for a period, as warm, moist air overrides below freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to rain in the warm sector behind the front. Lake effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward downwind shores. The same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water, when it is termed ocean effect or bay effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall. The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts. These include areas east of the Great Lakes, the west coasts of northern Japan, the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and areas near the Great Salt Lake, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, and parts of the northern Atlantic Ocean. Orographic or relief snowfall is caused when masses of air pushed by wind are forced up the side of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air up the side of a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow prone areas. A snowflake consists of roughly 1019 water molecules, which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground. As a result, snowflakes vary among themselves, while following similar patterns. Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets about 10 m in diameter freeze. These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than 18 C 0 F , because to freeze, a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice. Then the droplet freezes around this nucleus . In warmer clouds an aerosol particle or ice nucleus must be present in or in contact with the droplet to act as a nucleus. Ice nuclei are very rare compared to that cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form. Clays, desert dust and biological particles can be nuclei. Artificial nuclei include particles of silver iodide and dry ice, and these are used to stimulate precipitation in cloud seeding. Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environmentone where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air vapor onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the WegenerBergeronFindeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles. Micrography of thousands of snowflakes from 1885 onward, starting with Wilson Alwyn Bentley, revealed the wide diversity of snowflakes within a classifiable set of patterns. Closely matching snow crystals have been observed. Ukichiro Nakaya developed a crystal morphology diagram, relating crystal shapes to the temperature and moisture conditions under which they formed, which is summarized in the following table. Dendrites Hollow prisms Needles Solid plates Dendrites Solid plates Prisms Nakaya discovered that the shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line trend more towards solid and compact. Crystals formed in supersaturated air trend more towards lacy, delicate and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form such as side planes, bullet rosettes and also planar types depending on the conditions and ice nuclei. If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime, at around 5 C 23 F , and then falls into the warmer plate like regime, then plate or dendritic crystals sprout at the end of the column, producing so called capped columns . Magono and Lee devised a classification of freshly formed snow crystals that includes 80 distinct shapes. They documented each with micrographs. Snow accumulates from a series of snow events, punctuated by freezing and thawing, over areas that are cold enough to retain snow seasonally or perennially. Major snow prone areas include the Arctic and Antarctic, the Northern Hemisphere, and alpine regions. The liquid equivalent of snowfall may be evaluated using a snow gauge or with a standard rain gauge, adjusted for winter by removal of a funnel and inner cylinder. Both types of gauges melt the accumulated snow and report the amount of water collected. At some automatic weather stations an ultrasonic snow depth sensor may be used to augment the precipitation gauge. Snow flurry, snow storm and blizzard describe snow events of progressively greater duration and intensity. A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions in different parts of the world. In the United States, a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more A sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles per hour 56 km h , and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than 0.4 kilometers 0.25 mi . In Canada and the United Kingdom, the criteria are similar. While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions, falling snow is not a requirement, as blowing snow can create a ground blizzard. Snowstorm intensity may be categorized by visibility and depth of accumulation. Snowfall's intensity is determined by visibility, as follows The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground defines height of new snow as the depth of freshly fallen snow, in centimeters as measured with a ruler, that accumulated on a snowboard during an observation period of 24 hours, or other observation interval. After the measurement, the snow is cleared from the board and the board is placed flush with the snow surface to provide an accurate measurement at the end of the next interval. Melting, compacting, blowing and drifting contribute to the difficulty of measuring snowfall. Glaciers with their permanent snowpacks cover about 10 of the earth's surface, while seasonal snow covers about nine percent, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, where seasonal snow covers about 40 million square kilometres 1510 6 sq mi , according to a 1987 estimate. A 2007 estimate of snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere suggested that, on average, snow cover ranges from a minimum extent of 2 million square kilometres 0.7710 6 sq mi each August to a maximum extent of 45 million square kilometres 1710 6 sq mi each January or nearly half of the land surface in that hemisphere. A study of Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent for the period 19722006 suggests a reduction of 0.5 million square kilometres 0.1910 6 sq mi over the 35 year period. The following are world records regarding snowfall and snowflakes After deposition, snow progresses on one of two paths that determine its fate, either ablation mostly by melting or transitioning from firn multi year snow into glacier ice. During this transition, snow is a highly porous, sintered material made up of a continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space, forming together the snow microstructure . Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process, known as metamorphism, wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the pore space. Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing. Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as hoar frost, during cold, still conditions. Over the course of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is approximately 30 of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50 of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into neve, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Neve has a minimum density of 500 kilograms per cubic metre 31 lb cu ft , which is roughly half of the density of liquid water. Firn is snow that has persisted for multiple years and has been recrystallized into a substance denser than neve, yet less dense and hard than glacial ice. Firn resembles caked sugar and is very resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from 550 kilograms per cubic metre 34 lb cu ft to 830 kilograms per cubic metre 52 lb cu ft , and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a glacier. The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the firn limit, firn line or snowline. There are four main mechanisms for movement of deposited snow drifting of unsintered snow, avalanches of accumulated snow on steep slopes, snowmelt during thaw conditions, and the movement of glaciers after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice. When powdery, snow drifts with the wind from the location where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes. An avalanche also called a snowslide or snowslip is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack slab avalanche when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening loose snow avalanche . After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. They occur in three major mechanisms Many rivers originating in mountainous or high latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow for the rest of the year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer. Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque corrie or cwm , a typically armchair shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming neve. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure. On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15 m 50 ft of snow ice. Scientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the physics of chemical bonds and clouds the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike. Snow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on the ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow related processes over large areas. In the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees.Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground includes are snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table hexagonal or irregular in shape accretion of supercooled water droplets or milky glazed surface supercooled water, size 5 mm mostly small spheroids Graupel or snow pellets encased in thin ice layer small hail . Size both 5 mm needles pointing into the wind Thin breakable crust forms on snow surface if process continues long enough. All are formed in cloud, except for rime, which forms on objects exposed to supercooled moisture. It also has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature. Remote sensing of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi spectral collection of imagery. Multi faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground truth studies of the actual conditions. Satellite observations record a decrease in snow covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3 per decade. The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visibleinfrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center NSIDC uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack. Snow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrologyelements of the Earth's water cyclewhich help describe global climate change. Global climate change models GCMs incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo reflectivity of incident radiation, including light and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent SWE in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover. The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground defines SWE as the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely . Given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm. Snow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes. Snow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. They share a common tool for clearing snow, the snowplow. However, the application is different in each casewhereas roadways employ anti icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks. In the late 20th century, an estimated 2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and equipment used for winter maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe. The dominant effect of snow on vehicle contact with the road is diminished friction. This can be improved with the use of snow tires, which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction. However, the key to maintaining a roadway that can accommodate traffic during and after a snow event is an effective anti icing program that employs both chemicals and plowing. The FHWA Manual of Practice for an Effective Anti icing Program emphasizes anti icing procedures that prevent the bonding of snow and ice to the road. Key aspects of the practice include understanding anti icing in light of the level of service to be achieved on a given roadway, the climatic conditions to be encountered, and the different roles of deicing, anti icing, and abrasive materials and applications, and employing anti icing toolboxes , one for operations, one for decision making and another for personnel. The elements to the toolboxes are The manual offers matrices that address different types of snow and the rate of snowfall to tailor applications appropriately and efficiently. Snow fences, constructed upwind of roadways control snow drifting by causing windblown, drifting snow to accumulate in a desired place. They are also used on railways. Additionally, farmers and ranchers use snow fences to create drifts in basins for a ready supply of water in the spring. In order to keep airports open during winter storms, runways and taxiways require snow removal. Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding to the pavement surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows. Given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft, vehicles with large plow blades, an echelon of plow vehicles or rotary snowplows are used to clear snow on runways and taxiways. Terminal aprons may require 6 hectares 15 acres or more to be cleared. Properly equipped aircraft are able to fly through snowstorms under Instrument flight rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise the safety of the aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface. Railroads have traditionally employed two types of snow plows for clearing track, the wedge plow, which casts snow to both sides, and the rotary snowplow, which is suited for addressing heavy snowfall and casting snow far to one side or the other. Prior to the invention of the rotary snowplow ca. 1865, it required multiple locomotives to drive a wedge plow through deep snow. Subsequent to clearing the track with such plows, a flanger is used to clear snow from between the rails that are below the reach of the other types of plow. Where icing may affect the steel to steel contact of locomotive wheels on track, abrasives typically sand have been used to provide traction on steeper uphills. Railroads employ snow shedsstructures that cover the trackto prevent the accumulation of heavy snow or avalanches to cover tracks in snowy mountainous areas, such as the Alps and the Rocky Mountains. Trucks plowing snow on a highway in Missouri Airport snow clearing operations include plowing and brushing Swiss low profile, train mounted snowplow Snow can be compacted to form a snow road and be part of a winter road route for vehicles to access isolated communities or construction projects during the winter. Snow can also be used to provide the supporting structure and surface for a runway, as with the Phoenix Airfield in Antarctica. The snow compacted runway is designed to withstand approximately 60 wheeled flights of heavy lift military aircraft a year. Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving the heat of the Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres 1.6 million hectares . Snow is an important consideration for loads on structures. To address these, European countries employ Eurocode 1 Actions on structures Part 1 3 General actions Snow loads. In North America, ASCE Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures gives guidance on snow loads. Both standards employ methods that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs. Snow loads and icings are two principal issues for roofs. Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it. Snow loads The Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads It gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The Eurocode 1 uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe. Icings Roofs must also be designed to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow. Landlords are obligated to maintain their roofs and take reasonable steps in order to prevent snow or ice from falling on pedestrians. In situations where pedestrians are injured from falling ice or snow courts look at both the buildings history and the landlord's knowledge of the accumulation. Even if the owner claims to have not known about the accumulation, the court may still rule that it was the fault of the landlord for not checking and maintaining their roof during or after a snowstorm. In areas with trees, utility distribution lines on poles are less susceptible to snow loads than they are subject to damage from trees falling on them, felled by heavy, wet snow. Elsewhere, snow can accrete on power lines as sleeves of rime ice. Engineers design for such loads, which are measured in kg m lb ft and power companies have forecasting systems that anticipate types of weather that may cause such accretions. Rime ice may be removed manually or by creating a sufficient short circuit in the affected segment of power lines to melt the accretions. Snow figures into many winter sports and forms of recreation, including skiing and sledding. Common examples include cross country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. The design of the equipment used, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with the coefficient of friction of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by ski waxes. Skiing is by far the largest form of winter recreation. As of 1994, of the estimated 6575 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in Alpine skiing, the rest engaged in cross country skiing. Approximately 30 million skiers of all kinds were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year. The preponderant region for downhill skiing was Europe, followed by Japan and the US. Increasingly, ski resorts are relying on snowmaking, the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use. Ski wax enhances the ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the skitoo little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic or dynamic friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow. Snow affects warfare conducted in winter, alpine environments or at high latitudes. The main factors are impaired visibility for acquiring targets during falling snow, enhanced visibility of targets against snowy backgrounds for targeting, and mobility for both mechanized and infantry troops. Snowfall can severely inhibit the logistics of supplying troops, as well. Snow can also provide cover and fortification against small arms fire. Noted winter warfare campaigns where snow and other factors affected the operations include Bivouac of Napoleon's Grande Armee, during the winter retreat from Moscow Finnish ski troops during the invasion of Finland by the Soviet Union Army vehicles coping with snow during the Battle of the Bulge of World War II. Norwegian military preparations during the 2009 Cold Response exercise Navy SEALs training for winter warfare at Mammoth Mountain, California. Both plant and animal life endemic to snow bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat. Snow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation. Snow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many invertebrates thrive in snow, including spiders, wasps, beetles, snow scorpionflys and springtails. Such arthropods are typically active at temperatures down to 5 C 23 F . Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce antifreeze agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub freezing conditions. Some organisms fast during the winter, which expels freezing sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism. Small vertebrates are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, alpine salamanders are active in snow at temperatures as low as 8 C 18 F they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than 250 grams 8.8 oz . Omnivores are more likely to enter a torpor or be hibernators, whereas herbivores are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. Voles store up to 3 kilograms 6.6 lb of food and pikas up to 20 kilograms 44 lb . Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth. On the surface, wolves, coyotes, foxes, lynx, and weasels rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them. Extraterrestrial snow includes water based precipitation, but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the Solar System.

"Snow , Suno is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Studio Mebius for Windows PCs on January 31, 2003. It was later ported without the erotic content to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable consoles. The story of Snow revolves around the life of Kanata Izumo, who is revisiting a village to help his relative manage a hot spring inn. The gameplay in Snow follows a branching plot line which offers pre determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters by the player character. The game was successful in both sales and popularity, it was ranked as the best selling PC game sold in Japan at the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterward. Snow was voted as the twenty sixth best bishojo game by the readers of Dengeki G's Magazine in 2007. A manga titled Snow Pure White based on the visual novel was serialized in Comptiq between the September and December 2003 issues. Five light novels and several comic anthologies were also released, as were audio dramas. Studio Mebius went on to release a visual novel called Tomodachi Ijo Koibito Miman on September 24, 2004, which shares the same setting and characters from Snow but takes place years later and focuses on Meiko Tachibana. Snow is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Kanata Izumo. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Kanata is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. There are four main story routes in the original Windows release that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. In adult versions of the game, there are scenes depicting Kanata and a given heroine having sex. The story of Snow starts when the main protagonist Kanata Izumo revisits a small village from his childhood called Ryujin mura , lit. Dragon God Village . He is revisiting Ryujin mura to help manage a local inn with hot springs, Ryujin Tenshukaku , lit. Dragon God Keep , alongside his cousin Tsugumi. In the village, there is an old legend In ancient times, Ryujin mura was protected by the dragon goddess. However, one day the goddess fell in love with a human, which is strictly forbidden, and this incident caused the village to be always covered by snow after that. The game then tells the daily life of Kanata interacting with the village girls and ultimately links the story to the legend. Snow follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. The player assumes the role of Kanata Izumo , Izumo Kanata , who is visiting Ryujin mura as a part time worker of the local inn owned by his cousin. During his stay, he meets his childhood friend and the main heroine of the game Sumino Yukizuki , Yukizuki Sumino, voiced by Nirai Kanai , a soothing and gentle girl whose father has died. She loves anman a kind of mantou and claims that it's a source of life. Kanata also encounters a young energetic girl with a tomboy personality called Asahi Hiyorigawa , Hiyorigawa Asahi, voiced by Rita , suddenly appearing before Kanata and claiming that she will repulse the evil from him. In the outskirts of the village, Kanata meets the mysterious Shigure Kitazato , Kitazato Shigure, voiced by Hikaru Isshiki Shigure has a shy personality and is extremely silent. The protagonist also finds a little girl called Oka Wako , Wako Oka, voiced by Kanae Tsumugi waiting around the jinja for her parents. She likes to play with her cat called Shamon . The physician of Ryujin mura has a daughter called Meiko Tachibana , Tachibana Meiko, voiced by Chisato Suzumori , who is a close friend of Sumino. She likes to tease Kanata, and acts bizarrely in front of him. In Snow Plus Edition, a new character referred to as Mysterious Girl , Nazo no Shojo, voiced by Tomoe Tamiyasu is introduced, bearing many secrets. Snow was planned to be released at the beginning of 2001, but the release date would end up being postponed several times until it was released two years later in 2003. The artists for Snow were Asuka Pyon, who was in charge of character design, and Kobuichi. The game's scenario was written by three members of staff Mochizuki Jet, Klein, and Jinno Masaki. Kazuya Takase from I've Sound composed the songs in Snow, while Famishin composed the background music BGM . According to the liner notes on the original soundtrack of Snow, the producers acknowledged that the game's structure resembled Key's visual novels Kanon and Air. Yuichi Suzumoto, who is known for his work on various Key games, worked as an assistant writer for Snow. The setting of the game, Ryujin mura, was modeled after the real village Ryujin in Wakayama Prefecture.

"Snow camouflage is the use of a coloration or pattern for effective camouflage in winter, often combined with a different summer camouflage. Summer patterns are typically disruptively patterned combinations of shades of browns and greys, up to black, while winter patterns are dominated by white to match snowy landscapes. Among animals, variable snow camouflage is a type of seasonal polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. This was used as early evidence for natural selection. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round. In military usage, soldiers often either exchange their disruptively patterned summer uniforms for thicker snow camouflage uniforms printed with mainly white versions of camouflage patterns in winter, or they wear white overalls over their uniforms. Some armies have made use of reversible uniforms, printed in different seasonal patterns on their two sides. Vehicles and guns are often simply repainted in white. Occasionally, aircraft too are repainted in snow camouflage patterns. Charles Darwin mentioned the white winter coloration of the ptarmigan in his 1859 Origin of Species When we see ... the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red grouse the colour of heather, and the black grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds ... in preserving them from danger. The white protective coloration of arctic animals was noted by an early student of camouflage, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in his 1889 book Darwinism he listed the polar bear, the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the gyr falcon as remaining white all year, while the arctic fox, arctic hare, ermine and ptarmigan change their colour, and observed the obvious explanation , that it was for concealment, at a time when Darwinism was at a low ebb. Later zoologists such as Hugh B. Cott have echoed his observations, adding that other animals of the Arctic such as musk ox, moose, reindeer, wolverine and raven never become white even in the coldest parts of their range . Cott noted that both animals that hunt, like polar bear and stoat, and prey animals like ptarmigan and mountain hare, require camouflage to hide from prey or from predators respectively. There is little experimental evidence for the adaptiveness of white as camouflage, though the ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan it is difficult to escape the conclusion that cryptic brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation. All the same, he notes, in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by Gyrfalcons throughout the winter. Some animals of the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock ptarmigan change their coat colour by moulting and growing new fur or feathers from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment. The seasonal polyphenism in willow grouse differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages breeding and non breeding , while in Scandinavia there is a third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality. Climate change from global warming is leading to a mismatch between the seasonal coat coloration of arctic animals such as snowshoe hares with the increasingly snow free landscape. The principle of varying coloration with the changing seasons has military applications. In the First World War, firing and observation positions were hand painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and they sometimes varied their patterns seasonally. Uniforms were largely of a single colour, such as the British khaki but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their uniform caps. Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European countries preferred separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. The Waffen SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having to make do with ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1943 new white two piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen. The Red Army issued a report, Tactical and Technical trends, No. 17 in January 1943 on the camouflage of tanks in winter. It advised either all white using zinc white or titanium white paint for level, open country, or disruptive two colour winter camouflage for areas with more variety including forests, underbrush, small settlements, thawed patches of earth . The two colours could be achieved either by leaving around a quarter to a third of the vehicle's summer camouflage uncovered, or by repainting the whole vehicle in white with dark gray or gray brown spots. Units were advised not to paint all their vehicles identically, but to have some tanks all white, some in white with green stripes, and some in white and gray or gray brown. Winter camouflage was not limited to paint tracks left in the snow were to be obliterated, vehicles parked in cover, headlights covered with white fabric, shelters constructed, or else vehicles covered with white fabric, or dark fabric scattered with snow. Later in the 20th century, as disruptively patterned uniforms became widespread, winter variants of patterns such as Flecktarn were developed, the background colour such as green being replaced with white to form a Schneetarn snow camouflage pattern . Aircraft deployed in winter have sometimes been snow camouflaged, as with Sepecat Jaguars on exercise in Norway. Snow camouflage is manufactured commercially for use by hunters. For example, NaturalGear derive their patterns from photographic images using the colors of nature .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%20camouflage

An estimated 11.4 million viewers tuned into the episode, and it placed second in its timeslot, though it garnered five percent fewer viewers than the previous episode. Snow Falls received generally positive reviews from television critics, with several calling it an indication that the series was improving over time. The chemistry between Goodwin and Dallas was particularly highlighted for praise. A novelization of the episode was released in 2013. A troll is shown in the forest. In the Enchanted Forest, a guarded carriage carrying Prince Charming Joshua Dallas and his fiancee, Abigail Anastasia Griffith , is halted by a roadblock. Charming notices a fallen tree is blocking the road, and that it was cut on purpose. The carriage is ambushed by a hooded vagabond, who takes Charming's bag of valuables, including a wedding ring.

Now that he has saved Snow, she decides to trust him, and agrees to lead him to the place where she sold the items. They reach the dilapidated bridge where Snow sold Charming's goods to a group of trolls. When she asks the trolls if she can buy back the ring, the trolls become suspicious and discover the wanted poster of Snow, leading to a fight. Snow comes to Charming's rescue by using fairy dust to turn the trolls into bugs. Charming is surprised that Snow saved him, but she wants to repay him for saving her life. As she hands him back the items, including the wedding ring, Snow looks at the ring, then places it on her finger before handing it back to him as they go their separate ways.

The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry Jared S. Gilmore looking at the comatose John Doe Dallas while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince Charming and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, convinced that it will wake him up. Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina Parrilla , as he had been instructed to do should there be a change in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret. The next day, Emma, Henry and Mary Margaret stop by the hospital to see him, only to discover that the patient has left on his own and might be bleeding. Regina and Sheriff Graham Jamie Dornan have also shown up, since Regina is the emergency contact for John Doe. She claims that she had found him on the side of the road unconscious without any memory of what or who he was. As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy Lee Arenberg , and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job since he is actually Sleepy . Emma and the others discover that John Doe went out into the woods. As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham search the wooded area for John Doe, they are joined by Henry. Henry believes that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take him back to the hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn Griffith , and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher. Snow Falls was written by co executive producer Liz Tigelaar, while being directed by The Shield veteran Dean White. The episode features the first appearance of Anastasia Griffith as Abigail Kathryn Nolan, a recurring role. Her casting was announced in early August 2011, with her character being variously described as spoiled and regal . Actor David Anders also made his first appearance in this episode as Dr. Whale. The episode serves as a prequel to the events of the pilot. In October 2011, Ginnifer Goodwin told reporters that she was excited to portray the beginning of Snow and Charming's relationship because it is based more on animosity and manipulation and selfishness. She added that they have a very far way to go from their moment of meeting to falling in love, making the episode greatly challenging and fun. In the scene in which Snow White is captured by The Queen's henchmen, Goodwin tweeted that the horse ran right into her, sending her flying and injuring her hand and face. Goodwin explained that we go on quite an adventure and I came away with an actual, physical scar from it. The incident required that the actress' face receive stitches in a hospital emergency room. Goodwin and Joshua Dallas said that it was their favorite episode up to that point, with Dallas saying it was lot of fun to shoot and its just great. In another tweet, Goodwin commented that Jennifer Morrison taught her to perform CPR during a scene with Dallas, as Morrison learned the procedure while she was a regular on House M.D. The episode was included in Reawakened A Once Upon a Time Tale a novelization of the first season which was written by Odette Beane and published by Hyperion Books in May 2013. The novel is intended to give fans of the show a whole new look at their favorite characters and stories, and is alternately set from the perspective of Emma Swan and Snow White, who narrate events in Storybrooke and the Enchanted Forest, respectively. Snow Falls first aired in the United States on November 6, 2011, earning strong ratings. It was watched by an estimated 11.4 million viewers, five percent less than the previous episode. It earned a ratings share of 3.7 among adults aged 18 to 49 and a 6.6 score among overall viewers. The episode ranked second in its timeslot behind Football Night In America on NBC but ahead of The Simpsons on the Fox network and The Amazing Race on CBS. In Canada, the episode was watched by an estimated 1.732 million viewers, a rise from the previous episode's 1.44 million. The show ranked 16th overall for the week. The episode was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for Zap2it, Andrea Reiher stated that this episode was the best since the pilot, explaining that if they continue to be this good, this show should be in for a long run. Reiher cited Goodwin's wonderful, captivating performance and the parallels between the Storybrooke and Enchanted Forest stories as particular highlights. In a review from TV Fanatic, writer Christine Orlando stated that the episode had me on the edge of my seat and enjoying the ride, giving particular praise to Snow and Charming's chemistry filled early relationship. Orlando concluded, Snow White, the character I had the least interest in two weeks ago, held her own and then some. Heck, I was so enthralled by her story that, for the first time ever, I can't wait to learn more. Sound on Sight's Ricky D thought it wise that the episode focused on Snow and Charming, without feeling the need to include multiple stories. He felt that Goodwin had excellent chemistry with Dallas and that her performance saved the silliness of the modern day plot, especially in her developing relationship with Emma. IGN's Amy Ratcliffe gave Snow Falls a score of 8 out of 10 and felt that while everyone delivered solid performances... Goodwin stole the show for playing a character who was not an innocent, doe eyed girl. Like Orlando, Ratcliffe also felt that Goodwin and Dallas hit a perfect rhythm every time they share the screen, but expressed concern about how the series would continue cutting between both worlds. Shaunna Murphy of Entertainment Weekly cited Snow Falls as evidence that the show was continuing down the fortunate path of getting better each week. Murphy was interested in Sheriff Graham, speculating that he might be the Huntsman from Snow White, which would be a good, complicated role for him. The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava was less positive, giving the episode a grade of C . He was pleased the plot moved forward, but felt the execution did not work he cited the major problems of the lack of any sort of subtlety, nonsensical story developments, and Henry. Sava derided the corny dialogue and use of flashbacks, but wrote that the best thing about the episode was the introduction of Dr. Whale and Kathryn Nolan, and also praised the acting.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%20Falls

The main and supporting cast of Snow Prince was revealed on 11 May 2009, and the filming subsequently took place at a movie village located in Shonai, Yamagata from November 2008 to February 2009. The theme song of this film, entitled Snow Prince, was sung by a group of 10 boys including Shintaro Morimoto, the lead actor of this film. This song debuted at the 9th position on the Oricon weekly charts. Snow Prince had its international debut in Flanders, Belgium, the setting for A Dog of Flanders. It then showcased at the 2009 Hawaii International Film Festival, and subsequently opened in Japanese cinemas on 12 December 2009. The film, which grossed 845,375 in Japan and Singapore, received mixed reviews from critics.

The film opens when Sayo Arima, a girl brought up in a wealthy family and now an elderly woman, unexpectedly receives a manuscript written by Haigo, a circus clown whom she met many years ago. It deals with the events seventy years earlier when Sayo was friends with Sota, a poor village boy who lived with his grandfather and dreamt of being a painter. The film moves back to that time, when a circus came to the town where Sayo and Sota lived. Despite Sota's grandfather warning him not to go near the circus, Sota goes with Sayo. After the performance, they sneak backstage and are caught by the circus clown Haigo, who kindly gives Sota an egg, which he had intended to buy for his grandfather. Sota believes that the clown can read his mind, and calls him Kamisama, which means god in Japanese. Later, while talking to Sayo's classmates, Sota learns about a legendary paint nicknamed Night Sky which can only be produced from materials unique to a particular pond. Sayo and Sota resolve to find the pond together. However, the route to the pond is dangerous, and involves passing through a train tunnel. In the tunnel Sayo trips and is nearly run over by a train. Sota manages to pull her out just in time, but is scolded by Mr. Arima, Sayo's father, for taking her to such a dangerous place. He tells his wife not to let them meet again. Later, Sota returns to the pond with the circus clown. Sota offers to paint a picture of him, but the clown refuses and advises Sota to paint whatever his heart desires. He decides to paint Sayo playing the piano after he watches Sayo play the Clair de lune . To save money for the painting paper, Sota goes hungry and eats just a few grains of rice each day. Sota's grandfather dies, and after the funeral, Sota goes to the circus to find solace in the circus clown, only to discover that the circus has moved away. In the present again, the manuscript the old man brought has ended, and Sayo recounts the rest of the story. Despite the difficulties he faces, Sota manages to complete the painting, which he decides to give to Sayo. He and Chibi go to Sayo's house, where Sayo is having a birthday party with her classmates. Sota gives the painting to Soya's father, who agrees to pass the painting to Sayo. Sota continues walking in the snow. Just as he settles down to rest, he discovers that Mr. Arima's warehouse is on fire. Sota helps to put out the fire and calls for help. He leaves before Soya's father arrives, and Mr. Arima launches a manhunt to find Sota to thank him. When this hunt is unsuccessful, Sayo suggests that they look for him at the pond. They find him there, dead. In the present day again, the old man leaves and Sayo starts playing the Clair de lune on the piano. The actors cast for roles in the film include Snow Prince was directed by Joji Matsuoka, whose previous works include the films Tokyo Tower Mom and Me, and Sometimes Dad 2007 and Sayonara, Kuro 2003 . Kundo Koyama wrote the screenplay of his film. Snow Prince is Kundo Koyama's second work, after his work on the Departures, which won the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 81st Academy Awards. The film was inspired by the 1872 English novel A Dog of Flanders, written by Marie Louise de la Ramee, and by the film Small Love Melody, both of which were popular with Japanese audiences and well known in Japan. In the movie, an Akita dog was used instead of the Flemish breed used in the novel, and the setting was moved to Yamagata Prefecture in Japan instead of Flanders, Belgium. When asked about these changes, director Joji Matsuoka said that this film is not specifically shot at any location and that he used an Akita because it is representative of Japan . Asahi Shinbun reported that Snow Prince's script was also partly inspired by the script of an anime version of A Dog of Flanders that was released previously. New actor Shintaro Morimoto and new actress Marino Kuwashima were officially revealed as the lead cast members of this film at the film's 10th press conference on 11 May 2009. They were handpicked from a group of 10,000 people in an audition by director Joji Matsuoka. Matsuoka reportedly decided to choose Shintaro and Marino because they had a different twinkle in their eyes . In particular, Shintaro, the younger brother of Hey Say JUMP member Ryutaro Morimoto, was praised by the director, who said that he was looking for a child who can exist for real . Matsuoka described Shintaro's qualities as rare nowadays , and also described him as an angel .

Asano is also the winner of the Best Lead Actor award at the 33rd Japan Academy Awards. He plays the role of the circus clown Haigo, who is also the secret father of Sota, in this film. Scenes of Sota's and the Arima family's houses, the village and the playhouse of Sota and Sayo were shot at the Shonai Movie Village , Shonai Eigamura in Shonai, Yamagata. The filming at this location took place from November 2008 to February 2009. In addition, the scene where Mr. Arima's warehouse caught fire was filmed in Sakata, Sankyo Soko , Yamagata Prefecture. The railway tracks in the movie are those of the former Naruto no Kurikumada Koen Railway Line , Naruto no Kurikumada Koen Tetsudo , which used to operate in Miyagi Prefecture. The scene where Sayo played the Clair de lune and the ending scene of the film was shot at the former Fukura Elementary School , Fukura shogakko . Matsuoka described the filming conditions as very harsh , but said that the film was completed thanks to the children and ended by praising the perseverance of Shintaro and Kuwajima. Shintaro Morimoto said that the scene where the warehouse caught fire was the scariest scene in the entire film . Fellow actor Maiko also said that when she was seeing Shintaro and Marino acting like lovers, it reminded her of her first love .

Snow Prince is a choral song inspired by Claude Debussy's Clair de lune, or the third movement of the Suite bergamasque. The piece Clair de lune is also featured in the film. The Snow Prince Gasshodan group is a temporary boy choir that was formed specially for this movie, and it is led by actor Shintaro Morimoto. The group comes under the management of Johnny Jr., a Japanese talent agency that specially trains male idols. Snow Prince Gasshodan is made up of 10 boys, who together, had an average age of 10.5 years at the time of the filming.

He ended his review with This is the kind of family entertainment that Hollywood has long forgotten how to make.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%20Prince
"Snow Shark Ancient Snow Beast is a 2012 American horror film written, directed and photographed by Sam Qualiana, and produced by Richard Chizmar, Marc Makowski, and Greg Lamberson. The film stars Qualiana alongside Michael O'Hare, Kathy Murphy, C. J. Qualiana, Jackey Hall and Andrew Elias. The film follows the residents of a small town who are terrorized by a prehistoric man eating shark that can swim through snow. Production on Snow Shark began in early 2011. The film uses practical effects rather than computer generated imagery, and its budget was partially financed by a campaign on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo. The film, which was shot in Buffalo, New York, premiered at Dipson's Amherst Theatre on April 10, 2012, and received mixed reviews. The film was released on DVD by Independent Entertainment. On February 6, 1999, a team of three biologists, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, investigate a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small New York town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings may have something to do with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered a hole in the ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a snow shark , before it attacks him. Twelve years later, the snow shark has become a town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is informed when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once and for all. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while urinating. The next day, with the rest of the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and prepares to set out to kill it. A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, along with biologist Wendy Gardner and hunter Cameron Caine, visit the town and have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills every person in the party except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron make their way into the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers. When Lincoln finds that the camera has not detected any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots him in the head to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade, but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln decide to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard. Production on Snow Shark began in early 2011, with director Sam Qualiana having created the film's title, poster, and a teaser trailer before finalizing its script. Qualiana has stated, I always have had a fear of sharks. Not a lot of things scare me, but sharks terrify and fascinate me at the same time. Qualiana viewed the film as a mixture of the 1975 thriller film Jaws and the 1982 science fiction horror film The Thing. The film began shooting in Buffalo, New York, partially supported by an Indiegogo campaign launched by Qualiana with a fundraising goal of 3,000. Production was met with minor weather related difficulties, including overcoming cold temperatures and the task of preventing snow from gathering on the lens of the film camera. Aside from instances of blood shown onscreen, the film's visual effects were created without the use of computer generated imagery. John Renna, who portrays the character Ethan, constructed a full size shark head to use during filming. Effects artists Andrew Lavin and Arick Szymecki created a miniature shark head, as well as several landscapes, to be used in the film. Some of the film's scenes were shot on weekends in order to prevent the melting of snow due to the arrival of spring. Qualiana noted that it was tough getting all the exterior shots before the snow melted. We cancelled some shoots due to warm weather and managed to do some cutaways outside with fake snow . Production ended in June 2011, in Lockport, New York. Post production was managed by Qualiana and producer Greg Lamberson, alongside B movie horror screenwriter Brett Piper and low budget filmmaker Mark Polonia. The film premiered at Dipson's Amherst Theater in Buffalo on April 10, 2012, and was subsequently shown at the Screening Room Cinema Cafe in Williamsville, New York two days later. On May 12, the film was screened at the South Bronx Film Festival. The film was released on DVD and was made available for digital download on December 11, 2012 it was distributed through Independent Entertainment. Brett Gallmann of the website Oh, the Horror criticized the film's amateurism, from the acting to the hastily sloshed upon digital effects , likening it to a no budget Troma affair that excels at being mostly forgettable . John Lyle of the website Bloodbath Beyond gave the film a score of 0.5 5, criticizing the brief overall time that the snow shark is shown onscreen. Nathaniel Thompson of Mondo Digital wrote that, in regards to Jaws rip offs , it was one of the more entertaining ones in recent years . Adrian Halen of HorrorNews.net found fault with the film's tiring dialogue but admired its charming special effects, writing that it shows just enough shark to make us hunger for more . In a review of the film's DVD release on the website HorrorTalk, the film is referred to as bad, real bad, but in all the most awesome ways possible .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%20Shark
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and originally released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, it is the first full length cel animated feature film and the earliest Disney animated feature film. The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben Sharpsteen directed the film's individual sequences. Snow White premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937, followed by a nationwide release on February 4, 1938. It was a critical and commercial success, and with international earnings of 8 million during its initial release briefly held the record of highest grossing sound film at the time. The popularity of the film has led to its being re released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office and the highest grossing animated film. Snow White was nominated for Best Musical Score at the Academy Awards in 1938, and the next year, producer Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by Shirley Temple. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked it among the 100 greatest American films, and also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008. Disney's take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural impact, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical. Snow White is a lonely princess living with her stepmother, a vain Queen. The Queen worries that Snow White will be more beautiful than her, so she forces Snow White to work as a scullery maid and asks her Magic Mirror daily who is the fairest one of all . For years the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her. One day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now the fairest in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children. In reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult dwarfsnamed Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopeywho work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance. Meanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the Sleeping Death , a curse she learns can only be broken by love's first kiss , but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death. The dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle. Development on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs began in early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature, to be released under Walt Disney Productions, to The New York Times. One evening that same year, Disney acted out the entire story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to his staff, announcing that the film would be produced as a feature length film. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been primarily involved in the production of animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Disney hoped to expand his studio's prestige and revenues by moving into features, and estimated that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs could be produced for a budget of US 250,000 this was ten times the budget of an average Silly Symphony. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and as such Walt Disney had to fight to get the film produced. Both his brother and business partner Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it, and the Hollywood movie industry referred to the film derisively as Disney's Folly while it was in production. He had to mortgage his house to help finance the film's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of 1,488,422.74, a massive sum for a feature film in 1937. On August 9, 1934, twenty one pages of notesentitled Snowwhite suggestions were compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, as well as situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated at the very beginning of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for screwiness and gags the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert Hurter, Ted Sears and Pinto Colvig were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney felt that the story should begin with Snow White's discovery of the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. Walt Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy. The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self important and bumbling, was named Doc others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy and Happy of the final seven were named at this point, Sneezy and Dopey were replaced by 'Jumpy' and an unnamed seventh dwarf. Along with a focus on the characterizations and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as Prince Oswald , an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment. It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride to the cottage to save Snow White but took the wrong road despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not understand . He, therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but would have been able to save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Hovarth. Other examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point include suggestions for a fat, batty, cartoon type, self satisfied Queen. The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story, offering five dollars for every 'gag' such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White. Disney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 that attention be paid exclusively to scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear . The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still open to change . A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled 'Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite', which introduced the character of Dopey, who would ultimately prove to be the most successful and popular of the dwarf characterisations. For the rest of 1934 Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be fat and batty , but a stately beautiful type , a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings. Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It is thought that he may have doubted his, and his studio's ability, and that his trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other. He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935, and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs. It had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story, and many sequences were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a lodge meeting in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup eating and bed building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio 1940 . The primary authority on the design of the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized. Two other concept artists Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen's Witch form. Art Babbitt Art Babbit, an animator who joined the Disney studio in 1932, invited seven of his colleagues who worked in the same room as him to come with him to an art class that he himself had set up at his home in the Hollywood Hills. Though there was no teacher, Babbit had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These classes were held weekly each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. Babbit ran the sessions for a month until animator Hardie Gramatky suggested that they recruit Don Graham the art teacher from the Chouinard Institute taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Phil Dike a few weeks later. These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting. Walt Disney in 1935 Though the classes were originally described as a brutal battle , with neither instructor nor students well versed in the other's craft, the enthusiasm and energy of both parties made the classes stimulating and beneficial for all involved. Graham often screened Disney shorts and, along with the animators, provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Graham criticised Babbit's animation of Abner the mouse in The Country Cousin as taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body , while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting dirty or mean or vulgar. The country mouse is always having a good time . Very few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training most had been newspaper cartoonists among these few was Grim Natwick, who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating Betty Boop for Fleischer Studios showed an understanding of human female anatomy, and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of The Goddess of Spring, had proved largely unsuccessful Natwick's animation of the heroine in Cookie Carnival showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of rotoscoping, considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. None of Babbit's animation of the Queen was rotoscoped despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live action footage. It proved difficult to add color to Snow White's and the queen's face.. Eventually they found a red dye that worked, and which was added with a small piece of cotton wrapped around a tipple pencil on each individual cel. Helen Ogger, an employee at the ink department, was also an animator and decided to use the same system used in animation. The method was so time consuming that it was never used again on the same scale. It was also used to a smaller degree in Pinocchio and Fantasia , but after Ogger left the studio in 1941 there were nobody with the same skills who could replace her. The studio's new multiplane camera gave a three dimensional feeling in many sequences and was also used to give a rotating effect in the scene where the Queen transforms into a witch. The songs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were composed by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey. Paul J. Smith and Leigh Harline composed the incidental music score. Well known songs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs include Heigh Ho , Some Day My Prince Will Come , and Whistle While You Work . Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through Bourne Co. Music Publishers, which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back the rights to the music from many of the other films, but not Snow White. Snow White became the first American film to have a soundtrack album, released in conjunction with the feature film. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a film soundtrack recording was unheard of and of little value to a movie studio. At this time, Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet 1936 to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffinto the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, as well as the two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu 1922 and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1919 , both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1931 , to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937, to a wildly receptive audience, many of whom were the same naysayers who had dubbed the film Disney's Folly . The film received a standing ovation at its completion from an audience that included Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of Time magazine. The New York Times said, Thank you very much, Mr. Disney . The American entertainment trade publication Variety observed that perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness. Following successful exclusive runs at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and a theater in Miami in January 1938, RKO Radio Pictures put the film into general release on February 4. It became a major box office success, earning four times more money than any other motion picture released in 1938. Snow White proved equally popular with foreign audiences. In September 1938seven months after the film's nationwide release in the United StatesVariety also reported that the animated feature was having a remarkably long box office run at theaters in Sydney, Australia. In that city it noted, Walt Disney's 'Snow White' RKO experienced no difficulty at hitting 11 weeks, with more ahead. Variety reported as well that Snow White was having even longer runs in other cities overseas, such as in London, where the film had generated greater box office receipts than during its exclusive New York screenings at Radio City Music Hall .mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden margin 1em 0 padding 0 40px .mw parser output .templatequote .templatequotecite line height 1.5em text align left padding left 1.6em margin top 0 'Snow White' RKO is in its 27th week at the New Gallery, London, and will continue to be shown through the regular London release dates, Sept. 19 for North London, and Sept. 26 for South London. There is a likelihood that the New Gallery first run will run until Christmas. Picture reported to have exceeded 500,000, passing Radio City's five week mark, which just fell short of the 500,000 mark. In total revenue during its original release, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs grossed 3.5 million in the United States and Canada, and by May 1939 its gross internationally amounted to 6.5 million, making it the most successful sound film of all time, displacing Al Jolson's The Singing Fool 1928 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was soon displaced from this position by Gone with the Wind in 1940 . By the end of its original run, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had earned 7,846,000 in international box office receipts. This earned RKO a profit of 380,000. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was first re released in 1944, to raise revenue for the Disney studio during the World War II period. This re release set a tradition of re releasing Disney animated features every seven to 10 years, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was re released to theaters in 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 1993. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary release in 1987, Disney released an authorized novelization of the story, written by children's author Suzanne Weyn. In 1993, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs became the first film to be entirely scanned to digital files, manipulated, and recorded back to film. The restoration project was carried out entirely at 4K resolution and 10 bit color depth using the Cineon system to digitally remove dirt and scratches. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has had a lifetime gross of 418 million across its original release and several reissues. Adjusted for inflation, and incorporating subsequent releases, the film still registers one of the top 10 American film moneymakers of all time. The film was a tremendous critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults. Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship finds that most reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences will forget that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones. At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field . Disney received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10 year old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score. Some Day My Prince Will Come has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, Frank Churchill, and Oliver Jones. Albums by Miles Davis, by Wynton Kelly, and Alexis Cole. Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a notable achievement in cinema Eisenstein went so far as to call it the greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro Goldwyn Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, The Wizard of Oz, in 1939. Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all black cast singing a jazz score. Snow White's success led to Disney moving ahead with more feature film productions. Walt Disney used much of the profits from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to finance a new 4.5 million studio in Burbank the location on which The Walt Disney Studios is located to this day. Within two years, the studio completed Pinocchio and Fantasia and had begun production on features such as Dumbo, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. The American Film Institute AFI , an independent non profit organization created in the United States by the National Endowment for the Arts, releases a variety of annual awards and film lists recognizing excellence in filmmaking. The AFI 100 Years... series, which ran from 1998 to 2008, created categorized lists of America's best movies as selected by juries composed from among over 1,500 artists, scholars, critics, and historians. A film's inclusion in one of these lists was based on the film's popularity over time, historical significance and cultural impact. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was selected by juries for inclusion on many AFI lists, including the following On October 28, 1994, the film was released for the first time on home video on VHS and LaserDisc as the first release in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection.

In the 2000s, DisneyToon Studios began development on a computer animated prequel to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, titled The Seven Dwarfs. Director Mike Disa and screenwriter Evan Spiliotopoulos pitched a story explaining how the Dwarfs met, and how the Evil Queen killed Snow White's father and took the throne. According to Disa, DisneyToon management changed the prequel to center around how Dopey lost his voice upon witnessing the death of his mother. After Disney purchased Pixar in 2006, John Lasseter, DisneyToons' new Chief Creative Officer, canceled Dwarfs. The Seven Dwarfs made rare appearances in shorts, despite their popularity they simply were too numerous to animate efficiently. Commissioned shorts The Standard Parade 1939 , The Seven Wise Dwarfs 1941, using mostly recycled footage , All Together 1942 and The Winged Scourge 1943 all include appearances. The animated television series House of Mouse, which included many Disney character animated cameos, included the characters in the special Mickey's Magical Christmas Snowed in at the House of Mouse.

"Snow White The Fairest of Them All is a 2001 fantasy adventure television film co written and directed by Caroline Thompson and produced by Hallmark Entertainment. The film was first released theatrically in Europe, and subsequently aired in the United States on ABC as part of their series on The Wonderful World of Disney on March 17, 2002. Based upon the traditional Snow White folktale first recorded in 1812 by German folklorists, the Brothers Grimm, the film deviates from earlier interpretations of the story in several respects. Set in a fantasy kingdom, it tells the story of Snow White Kristin Kreuk , and the attempts of her malevolent stepmother, Queen Elspeth Miranda Richardson , to eliminate her. Trying to escape Queen Elspeth's machinations, Snow White flees to the forest, where she befriends Sunday Michael J. Anderson , the leader of the seven dwarves, and together they plot the monarch's overthrow. Reviews were mixed, with Miranda Richardson's performance coming in for particular praise, but Kristin Kreuk's coming under criticism for being too bland. The film would subsequently be released on DVD. John and Josephine deeply wish to have a child and when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a creature known as the Green Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, the Green Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife as the creature cannot bring Josephine back from the dead. John's wishes come true, though he is unaware that the Green Eyed One owes Elspeth his hideous spellcasting sister a wish of her own. In order to fulfill her ambitions, the Green Eyed One transforms Elspeth into a beautiful young woman who can now marry John and become his queen and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband and stepdaughter who now becomes a beautiful princess sixteen years later . However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest of them all whenever she asks. When Prince Alfred arrives in the kingdom and falls in love with Snow White, Elspeth is furious to discover that images of Snow White are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is the fairest of them all. Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders a hunter, Hector, to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth also transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill Snow White, Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors and stifles Snow White with an enchanted ribbon. Snow White is saved by seven dwarfs, each named after the days of the week and possessing the power to transform into a rainbow to move from one place to another but are only capable if all seven of them are present . The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Snow White's deceased mother, Josephine, with the magic mirror the Green Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth disguised as Josephine finds Snow White and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White. With her task finished, Elspeth tries to resume her beautiful guise with the mirror. But instead, the magic mirror returns her to her true form, even more loathsome than before as punishment from the Green Eyed One for her evil behaviour. Meanwhile, the dwarfs, unable to revive Snow White, place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue. When she receives a kiss of true love from Prince Alfred in his bear form she is revived. The spells on Alfred, Sunday and Monday are broken and Elspeth's mirrors shatter, freeing John. Elspeth is cornered and presumably killed by other gnomes, who have been freed from their enchantments. Freed from Elspeth, the Green Eyed One is able to go his way. Snow White and Alfred live happily ever after while the dwarfs decide to move on to find Sleeping Beauty. In order to write the script, Caroline Thompson went back to the original written account of Snow White, published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812. She came to the decision that the folktale was about the fear of change , as two women, Snow White and her stepmother, came to adjust with the changes that they were facing in life. Noting that the original 19th century folk tales were far darker in content than most 20th century adaptations, such as Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 , she sought to utilise some of these dark elements in her adaptation. The idea for the Green Eyed One was introduced by co writer Julie Hickson Thompson noted that he was a genuinely moral being who tried to help people, comparing him to the genius of the peace found in Late Medieval literature. Upon reading the script, Kristin Kreuk noted that she had been entranced , believing that the main message that audiences would take away from the film was that of not judging an individual's personality based upon their physical appearances. Richardson thought that Caroline Thompson's adaptation was much more in keeping with the ethos of the Grimm tale than subsequent adaptations due to its darker nature. Praising Miranda Richardson as being perfect for the role of Elspeth, Caroline Thompson asserted that she had been a blast to work with. Caroline Thompson noted that she cast the actors to play the dwarves according to their own individual personalities she remarked that Warwick Davis was a phenomenal actor while Penny Blake was so funny and Michael J. Anderson was a genius. Together, she thought that they brought an array of talents to the production. Michael J. Anderson himself claimed that he identified with his character, the philosopher of the group , and really enjoyed playing the role. Commenting on his character of Wednesday, Vincent Schiavelli noted that he was miserable because he really thinks that he's a dwarf even though he isn't. Caroline Thompson would also praise her magnificent collaborators in costume and set design. The set designer noted that they constructed a castle that they felt was best described as Viking art nouveau. The film was released theatrically in Europe and the Middle East in 2001, and debuted in the United States on March 17, 2002, when it was broadcast as part of ABC's The Wonderful World of Disney series. Both Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs of the film were released. Reviewing the Artisan DVD release for the Combustible Celluloid website, Jeffrey M. Anderson praised its gorgeous full screen transfer , featurette, and cast and crew biographies, but highlighted that it contained no director's commentary track. Laura Fries reviewed the film for Variety, describing it as a unique and lavish production that certainly warrants attention but warning that it would be inappropriate for young children. Asserting that ABC had made a big mistake by airing it as a part of their Wonderful World of Disney series, she thought that it was often nightmarish , harking back to the original Grimm version more than the better known Disney adaptation in particular, she singled out the evil queen witch and satanic messenger who grants wishes. However, she praised David Brisbin's set design, remarking that he had created a kingdom which was equal parts gingerbread baroque and David Lynch and that Caroline Thompson clearly relishes in this universe. Noting that the magnificently villainous performance from Miranda Richardson virtually steals the show from the doe eyed Kristin Kreuk, she believes that the latter does little to upgrade the image of Snow White as the most victimized of fairytale characters. Writing for The New York Times, Hal Erickson praised the film for mixing its more frightening aspects with slapstick comedy and awesome special effects. Jeffrey M. Anderson reviewed Snow White for the Combustible Celluloid website, awarding it three stars out of four. Remarking that Thompson completely eradicates the Disney interpretation of the folktale, he praised her directorial debut, noting the influence of Tim Burton but claiming that she offers a more universal sweetness than he does. He notes that while remaining accessible to children, the film still drinks more deeply of the story's dark elements . David Parkinson of Radio Times awarded Snow White two stars out of five, praising Miranda Richardson's performance and comparing it to that of Sigourney Weaver in Snow White A Tale of Terror. He also acclaimed the casting of Vincent Schiavelli as the tall dwarf, but in contrast, he criticised Kristin Kreuk's inanimate performance , seeing her as a dull heroine. M.S. Mason of the Christian Science Monitor said Beautiful young Kristin Kreuk makes a lovely Snow White although felt that the film was only passable family fare .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow%20White%3A%20The%20Fairest%20of%20Them%20All
"Helen Foster Snow September 21, 1907 January 11, 1997 was an American journalist who reported from China in the 1930s under the name Nym Wales on the developing Chinese Civil War, the Korean independence movement and the Second Sino Japanese War. Snow's family moved often throughout her youth and she ended up living in Salt Lake City with her grandmother in her teenage years, until she decided to move to China in 1931. There, she married American journalist Edgar Snow and became a correspondent for several publications. While she and her husband were sympathetic to the revolutionaries in China, whom she compared favorably to the Nationalists under Chiang Kai shek, she was never a member of the Chinese or American Communist Party. While living in Beijing, the Snows befriended leftist leaders of the 1935 December 9th Movement, who arranged for first Edgar, then Helen to visit the communist wartime capital, Yan'an, in 1937, where she interviewed Chinese Communist leaders, including Mao Zedong. The Snows also conceptualized the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, known as the Gung Ho movement, which provided jobs and stability. In 1940, Snow returned to the United States, where she and Edgar divorced. She continued to support the Cooperatives and write books based on her experiences in China. In the late 1940s, critics grouped her with the China Hands as one of those responsible for the loss of China who went beyond sympathy to active support of Mao's revolution. Helen Foster was born in Cedar City, Utah, and raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints LDS Church . She was born to John Moody Foster and Hannah Davis, who met working as teachers at Ricks Academy, a school affiliated with the LDS Church. 102 15 Hannah graduated from Ricks Academy, and John was a graduate from Stanford University. Both of Helen's parents were descendants of Mormon pioneers who migrated to Utah in the mid 1800s. From the time Helen was young, the Foster family moved quite frequently. After Helen's birth in Cedar City, the Fosters moved to Chicago so John could attend law school. Several years later, the family once again moved to Idaho. The frequent moves helped to shape Helen's outgoing personality as she was constantly concerned about what her new peers would think of her. 18 Being the oldest child and only daughter of the family, she took on a lot of responsibility as the family expanded. She often worked alongside her mother to care for her three younger brothers and complete chores, especially when financial circumstances were difficult for the Fosters. 16 Upon entering high school, Helen moved to Salt Lake City to live with her grandmother and aunt. 19 She attended West High School and became involved in many school activities and organizations. She frequently worked on editing the school's yearbook and was elected student vice president of her senior class. Due to her father's influence, Helen planned on attending college at Stanford. But the cost of tuition was too much for her parents to consider. According to Helen, her parents believed that girls were not considered a good investment in higher education as they would only get married, while boys were worth it . 20 However, Helen's father agreed to pay for her attendance at the University of Utah. She attended school for several years, but did not graduate. Instead, Helen focused on work and was hired as a secretary for the Utah chapter of the American Silver Mining Commission. 23 While at this position, she decided she would like to work abroad in addition to her aspiration to write her own great American novel . Helen took the civil service exam and passed, yet there were no open positions in Europe, where she initially desired to go. However, her employer had a connection in China, ultimately securing a job for Helen with the president of an American company in Shanghai. 9 In August 1931, Helen set sail to Asia in the hopes of becoming a writer. Almost immediately after arriving in 1931, she met Edgar Snow, who had arrived in China in 1929. Ed was ready to return to America at this point as his mother had died and he was battling malaria. 2930 But meeting Helen convinced him to stay working in China. She was a big fan of his work, having collected all of his newspaper clippings. Upon their first meeting, Helen gave Edgar the folder of newspaper clippings, impressing him greatly. Helen wanted her career to emulate his. Less than one week after Helen's arrival, the Yangtze flood caused extreme damage around Shanghai. Helen was working as a foreign correspondent for the Seattle Star through the Scripps Canfield League, a newspaper publishing company, and was to provide images glorifying the glamorous Orient . 39 The flood of the Yangtze was the worst in recorded history, displacing 120,000 people. Over a period of three weeks, continuous floods killed over 600,000 and destroyed 12 million homes. 39 Several months later, on January 28, 1932, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai. Helen was in the battle area and used to watch the action from the tower at her apartment. 50 Edgar was in the midst of the battle. However, because of his foreigner status, he was able to observe the action up close with a lesser amount of risk. Helen too wanted to experience battle in person and take better pictures of the war. Ed helped her to get a press card, and Helen was on her way to becoming a war correspondent herself. 51 Helen had only planned to stay in China for a year. However, over the next year, a courtship blossomed between Helen and Edgar. Their adventurous lifestyles in China served as the backdrop for their affair. In a letter from the winter of 1932, Helen wrote, I like him better than anyone else I have ever known . 54 Edgar proposed to Helen on her 25th birthday, but she declined his offer. She didn't want their marriage to suffer because of her author psychology as she was working on a book. Several months later, Ed proposed once again and Helen accepted. The couple married on Christmas Day in 1932. 72 The Snows would remain in China for nearly a decade. At a time when many Chinese were impatient with the Nationalist government for not opposing Japanese more actively, the couple moved to Beiping, as Beijing was then called, and took up residence in a small house near Yenching University, where Edgar taught journalism. Helen enrolled in courses at the university. The couple benefited from extraterritorial status as foreigners in China, so they were exempt from Chinese law. With this privilege, the Snows were able to assist students in protesting Fascism and contribute to the student movement. Helen once observed, We couldn't have done anything if we'd been under Chinese law. A Chinese would have been executed for even messing with such things as we did . 62 The Snows served as a source of information for the students, providing them with information that was generally censored by the government. 73 While the Snows never joined the Communist party, they sympathized with Chinese students who desired to resist the Japanese. In 1935, Helen played a large role in orchestrating the anti Japanese December 9th Movement at Yenching after the attack on Manchuria. Between 800 and 3000 students are estimated to have marched in the streets on the night of December 9. 62 Helen not only directed the demonstration, but she also reported on it. This particular protest inspired the organization of 65 other demonstrations in 32 cities across China. 76 One week later, on December 16, an even larger demonstration took place. Nearly 10,000 students from 28 schools participated in this protest. 62 The Snows got to know idealistic and patriotic students, a number of whom were in their journalism classes, and some of whom were members of the Communist underground and would eventually become leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Edgar and Helen opened their home to student activists during this time as a safe place to develop plans of the student movement and Communist Party. 58 The couple helped translate Living China, a collection of stories that served as a modern left wing literary work. 10 Helen also produced and dispersed anti fascist documents to students. In addition, the Snows produced a magazine in 1937 called Democracy, which was intended to spread Christian ethics. 12 Edgar was intended to be the driving force behind the magazine, however, Helen took charge as her husband worked on his book. The Snows had an agreement that Helen would do all the work for the publication and Edgar would put his name on it as editor. However, the magazine's production came to an end when the Japanese invaded and seized copies from the presses that same year. Edgar was the first to go to the Red Areas and came back with the material for his Red Star Over China. Helen, or Peg , as she was known to her friends, was not to be outdone, and soon followed. In April 1937, Helen made a trip to the city of Yan'an, the location of the Chinese Communist Party's headquarters. Her trip was much longer than anticipated as the Japanese occupied Northern China beginning in July of that same year and bad weather conditions made it impossible to travel. In Yan'an, Helen was only the second foreign woman to enter the area, and the eighth foreign journalist to have such access. She interviewed Mao Zedong and also got his support for what would become the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. According to Yu Jianting, Helen's translator, Mao explained the history of the Red Army for the first time to Helen despite Edgar's multiple interviews with him the previous year. Chinese Communist leaders had not shared the history of the party previously as they wanted to be seen as equals within the community rather than heroes of the people . Mao provided Helen with a letter introducing her as a war correspondent, which would give her access to otherwise restricted areas. Mao also requested that Helen share the Chinese Communist Party's Ten Guiding Principles to Resist against Japan and Save the Nation on an international scale. 14 Helen's work with Mao gave her the opportunity to interview other important Communist Party figures in Yan'an, which would become the basis for her book. Helen also interviewed Kang Keqing, wife of the future head of state Zhu De. Kang informed Helen of several issues the army were facing, including lack of soldiers and weaponry. Helen maintained a friendship with Kang and the two exchanged letters for many years after Helen left China. While in Yan'an, Helen suffered from severe dysentery and became extremely ill. Despite her illness, Helen completed her book's manuscript in less than one year. Inside Red China was the first book ever written that focused on the city of Yan'an and became important literature to students all over China. 232 This book was supposed to be a companion work to Edgar's Red Star Over China, but it never received the acclaim that Edgar's work had. This specific trip to Yan'an provided Helen with the material to produce at least five other books. 14 Helen used experiences from this trip to write her most successful book, The Song of Ariran. She also drew upon her interviews with a Kim San, Korean independence leader she met in Yan'an. In 1937, Japan attacked China, destroying or gaining control over 90 of the country's modern industries. 15 The couple joined anti Japanese friends, such as Ida Pruitt, Israel Epstein, and Rewi Alley in organizing Chinese Industrial Cooperatives' Gung Ho industrial worker's cooperatives after 1937. Helen envisioned the concept for Indusco from the beginning. The purpose for the industrial cooperatives was to create jobs and income so the Chinese people could wield economic power against Japan. 1, 5 The system was to be run by its own members. Gung ho is Chinese for work together , which represents all peoples working together in cooperation. 138 The Nationalist Chinese Government under Chiang Kai shek was willing to provide funding for the cooperatives and that support would continue under Mao Zedong. 56 In 1938, the first booklet titled Chinese Industrial Cooperatives was published. 303 The first Committee for the Promotion of Industrial Cooperatives in China was formed on April 3, 1938. 305 Helen used her writing position with certain publications to create support and financial backing in America for the Chinese Cooperatives. In addition, the Snows became good friends with Colonel Evans Carlson, who had a connection to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 37 Helen believed Roosevelt would support the cooperatives in accordance with his New Deal policy. Eventually, Eleanor Roosevelt became a member of the American Board of Sponsors for the Cooperatives. 37, 39 Overall, the Cooperatives received funds from Americans as well as Chinese citizens in the Philippines. After the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives' first year in existence, 1,284 industrial cooperatives were functioning with 15,625 members. 306 By 1940, the numbers in membership nearly doubled. 57 With notoriety building around the cooperatives, Helen took it upon herself to publish a book on Indusco for an American audience. In 1941, she wrote and published China Builds for Democracy. 38 The book not only created publicity, but also accumulated support for the Cooperatives in the United States. 37 By June 1941, the Indusco system had reached its highest numbers, with 1,867 cooperatives with 29,284 registered members. 11 However, by the end of World War II, the Indusco model was not as powerful as it once was in China. In December 1945, only 335 Indusco cooperatives with 4,889 registered members were reported. 11 While Indusco declined in China, the model spread to other nations, including India, Burma, and Japan. Helen continued to promote the Indusco model as she remained a member and vice chairman of the American Committee to Aid Chinese Industrial Cooperatives until 1951 when it split. 39 She revived the committee in 1981. In 1982, it was proposed that the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives be revived again, and the Peking government granted permission for such a revival in 1983. 330 The Snows' marriage was strained and the Japanese occupation of much of China made life difficult. In December 1940, the Snows decided to move back to the United States in fear that the Japanese would make them prisoners of war. The attack on Pearl Harbor would take place exactly one year later. Prior to their departure, Ed was offered a position as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and Helen encouraged him to take it. 323 She returned to the United States without him. But not much time had passed until Ed realized he didn't want to be without his wife and the living conditions were too difficult for him to withstand much longer. The Snows had been in China for a decade and they were both lacking proper nutrition and vitamins. Nearly the entire time they were in Asia, they did not eat raw foods in order to avoid dysentery and their health was depleted. 323 Upon their initial return to the United States, the couple lived in California for a short time and then moved into a small mid 1700's house in Madison, Connecticut. While the Snows were settled back in America, Ed would continue to travel back and forth between home and Europe. His books and reporting on China had earned him critical acclaim in the U.S. This success made Ed a very valuable asset as a war correspondent. President Roosevelt often looked to Ed for his understanding on matters in Asia. 151 Roosevelt personally suggested Ed become a war correspondent once again, to which Ed agreed. Though he did not want to report on World War II directly after his time in China, his personal struggles with Helen and encouragement from Roosevelt pushed Ed to travel and cover the war. In 1945, the couple legally separated. Ed started a new relationship with actress Lois Wheeler and sought a divorce from Helen. The divorce proceedings took several years as the two were stalemated in terms of settlement. The couple formally divorced in 1949. Ed married Lois less than ten days after the official date of the divorce. He lived in exile in Switzerland until he died from cancer in 1972. Helen spent the rest of her life in Connecticut, developing an interest in family genealogy, drafting a novel, and writing short pieces on her experiences in China. Although Helen was never tried during the McCarthy era, her works suffered from the idea that she was a Chinese Communist sympathizer. She often had issues getting new books published and many of her books went out of print. Helen returned to China twice more in her lifetime. The first visit was from 1972 to 1973, following President Richard Nixon's trip in 1972 which eased relations between China and the United States. The second visit was in 1978 when Helen returned to China for six weeks with a camera crew. There she was interviewed and asked to recount her adventures of the 1930s with Edgar. She published her autobiography in 1984. On January 11, 1997, Helen Foster Snow died at the age of 89 at the Fowler Nursing Center in Guilford, Connecticut. Memorial services were held in Connecticut and China. An official Chinese memorial service took place in the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, an honor rarely bestowed upon foreigners. Prior to her death, she donated personal papers, book manuscripts, and photographs taken of Chinese notables in the 1930s to the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, which holds 63 manuscript boxes of her papers. After her death, in 1997, Helen's family donated remaining manuscripts, documents, and photographs to the Brigham Young University library. On October 2627, 2000, BYU held a Helen Foster Snow Symposium to celebrate this donation and gather scholars. At this symposium, the documentary Helen Foster Snow Witness to Revolution premiered. Part of a hospital and a school in Xi'an, China, were named after her. There is also a Helen Foster Snow wing in the Communist Eighth Route Army Museum in Xi'an and a Helen Foster Snow Society in Beijing. In 2009, the USChina Cultural Exchange Committee placed a 7 foot 2.1 m tall bronze statue of Helen Foster Snow, cast in China, in the Main Street Park of her hometown of Cedar City. In 2011, students and faculty from Southern Utah University began a collaborative project with Chinese musicians, dancers, and artists to create a dance drama based on Helen Foster Snow's life. In 1981, Helen Foster Snow was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in China and nominated again in 1982. In her memoir My China Years, Helen writes, The nomination was not for any particular achievement, but for the potential that my ideas and world view hold for peace and progress in the world . 329 In 1993, Helen was the first recipient of the China Writers Association's literary award. In June 1996, Helen was honored by the Chinese government as Friendship Ambassador, one of China's highest honors offered to foreign citizens. She was the first American and only the fifth person ever to receive the award. Helen Foster Snow wrote under the pen name Nym Wales, which her husband chose for her. Nym'' is the Greek word for name. Wales was used because she was part Welsh. However, the pseudonym created questions regarding nationality and whether the author was an insider of the Communist Party. 133 Helen's works amount to 40 books and 27 manuscripts. 19",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen%20Foster%20Snow
"Jon Snow is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones, in which he is portrayed by English actor Kit Harington. In the novels, he is a prominent point of view character. He is one of the most popular characters in the series, and The New York Times cites him as one of the author's finest creations. Jon is a main character in the TV series, and his storyline in the season 5 finale generated a strong reaction among viewers. Speculation about the character's parentage has also been a popular topic of discussion among fans of both the books and the TV series. Jon is introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, the honorable lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Knowing his prospects are limited by his status, Jon joins the Night's Watch, who guard the far northern borders from the wildlings who live beyond The Wall. As the rest of the Starks face grave adversity, Jon finds himself honor bound to remain with the Watch. In A Clash of Kings 1998 , he joins a scouting party investigating the growing threat from the otherworldly Others beyond the Wall, and manages to infiltrate the wildlings. Jon learns of their plans to invade Westeros in A Storm of Swords 2000 , and begins to fall in love with the fierce wildling woman Ygritte. He betrays themand Ygrittebefore they can attack, but the Night Watch's victory comes at a heavy price for Jon. Now the Lord Commander of the Watch, he appears briefly in 2005's A Feast for Crows. Jon returns as a prominent character in a A Dance with Dragons 2011 , working to negotiate an alliance between the Night's Watch and the wildlings. The growing animosity he has attracted from among the Watch finally catches up with him, and he is forced to face the dire consequences. On the HBO series Game of Thrones, Jon's storyline follows the character's plot arc from the novel series, though season 6, season 7 and season 8 of the TV adaptation continue on from the events of Martin's latest published installment. Harington was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. He was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television in 2012, 2016 and 2017. In A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is introduced as the 14 year old illegitimate son of Eddard Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon is described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes. Jon has the surname Snow customarily used for illegitimate children in the North and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as a constant reminder of Ned's infidelity. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in . Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can inhabit the wolf and share its experiences. David Orr of The New York Times describes Jon as a complex, thoughtful and basically good character . David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive producers of the television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon is one of several characters in the series who must face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths because The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are. Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered. Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode Battle of the Bastards , Laura Prudom suggests that Jon has the same shortcomings as his father he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use that predictable morality against him . Jon is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and has been called one of Martin's finest creations . Jon is introduced as the illegitimate son of a Northern lord who, realizing he is an outsider in his own family, follows his uncle to the far north and accepts the honorable duty of serving in the Night's Watch. But as much as he is a second class Stark at home, initially his fellow recruits and brothers of the Watch set him apart as privileged and aloof. Jon adapts, soon proving himself to be wise, compassionate, and a natural leader. Over the course of the series, Jon's loyalty to the Watch and its vows, his family, and even Westeros itself are tested as he becomes embroiled in the efforts of the wildlings from Beyond the Wall to force their way back into the Seven Kingdoms. He lives among them as a spy for the Watch, sympathetic to their cause and becoming romantically involved with the tenacious Ygritte. However he ultimately betrays them to defend The Wall. Later, as the newest Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, he pursues an alliance with the wildlings. Several reviews of 2011's A Dance with Dragons noted the return to the narrative of Jon, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, the three popular characters whom fans had missed most from the previous volume, A Feast for Crows. These favorites had last been featured 11 years before in Martin's A Storm of Swords. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon's leadership of the Night's Watch is complicated by several unprecedented challenges, including a wildling alliance, the demands of would be king Stannis Baratheon and the conflicting factions developing within the Watch itself. The New York Times notes that Jons leadership is the best hope of Westeros, so naturally hes in imminent danger throughout A Dance With Dragons. James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Jon's final chapter in A Dance with Dragons a harsh chapter in terms of fan expectations. You go from this total high of Jon giving this rousing speech about going after the evil Ramsay Bolton, to this utter low of his men turning against him. Jon's presence in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain. Asked what he thought was Jons biggest mistake , Martin replied Were they mistakes I guess they were mistakes in some ways since they led to him losing control of part of his group. But it might have been wise and necessary decisions in terms of protecting the realm and dealing with the threat of the White Walkers. I'm a huge student of history, and all through history theres always this question of what's the right decision. You look back with benefit of hindsight at a battle that was lost and say, 'The losing general was such an idiot.' Was Napoleon a genius for all the battles he won Or an idiot for losing at Waterloo Partly I'm reacting to a lot of the fantasy that has come before this. Ruling is difficult whether you're a Lord Commander of the Nights Watch or the King of England. These are hard decisions and each have consequences. We're looking at Jon trying to take control of Night's Watch and deal with the wildlings and the threat beyond The Wall. The identity of Jon's mother has created much speculation among readers of the series, and guessing her identity was the test Martin gave Benioff and Weiss when they approached him in March 2006 about adapting his novels into a TV series. In the novels, Martin hints that she could be a servant named Wylla, or the noblewoman Ashara Dayne. The popular fan theorycalled R L J , an abbreviation of Rhaegar Lyanna Jon proposes that Jon is not the son of Ned at all, but is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned's younger sister Lyanna Stark. Though the character is presented as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, David Orr voiced the doubt of some readers when he wrote in The New York Times in 2011, Jon Snow is presented as the illegitimate son of the Stark patriarch, although it's uncertain whether Stark is indeed his father. Actor Sean Bean, who portrays Ned in the HBO television series, said when asked in a 2014 interview about returning to the series to appear in flashbacks, I've definitely got some unfinished business that needs to be resolved there. I'm obviously not Jon Snow's dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don't you The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned's son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna. As recounted by Ned in A Game of Thrones, at a tourney years before the events of the novel, Rhaegar had shown public favor to Lyanna in the presence of his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell. When Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared a year later, her father Rickard and eldest brother Brandon confronted Rhaegar's father, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, demanding that his son return the abducted Lyanna. Aerys had Rickard and Brandon brutally executed for their insolence, inciting Ned and his friend Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End and Lyanna's betrothed, to rebel against Aerys. In what later became known as Robert's Rebellion, Aerys was overthrown and Rhaegar was killed by Robert in single combat. After a bloody battle against three of Aerys' Kingsguard protecting the Tower of Joy in Dorne, Ned found Lyanna inside, in a bed of blood. She died shortly after eliciting a promise from Ned. Once the war was won, he returned to Winterfell with his illegitimate son Jon. The R L J theory posits that rather than Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna, they fell in love and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a childJon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned promised Lyanna on her deathbed to claim the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne. HBO's Game of Thrones has included in its adaptation many of the hints identified by this theory. In the season 6 finale, The Winds of Winter , Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. Lyanna makes him promise to protect her sonJon. An infographic subsequently posted on the HBO controlled website MakingGameofThrones.com confirmed Rhaegar as Jon's father. Journalists later commented on the significance of two plot points in the season 7 episode Eastwatch . One of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, Drogon, approaches Jon calmly and allows the King in the North to pet him, seemingly recognizing him as a Targaryen. Later, Gilly learns from a book at the Citadel that a High Septon annulled Rhaegar's marriage, and married him to someone else in Dorne, suggesting the possibility that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. The season 7 finale episode The Dragon and the Wolf confirmed that Jon is indeed the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his birth name is actually Aegon Targaryen. Jon Snow is first introduced in A Game of Thrones 1996 , as he and his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. Known by all as Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed from the rest of the Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master at arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his vows. The next night, the body of a fallen Night's Watch brother brought back from the other side of The Wall rises as an undead wight, and Jon saves Mormont's life by killing the creature. In thanks, Mormont gives Jon the House Mormont ancestral sword Longclaw, made of Valyrian steel, with a wolf's head handle custom made for Jon. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat. In 1998's A Clash of Kings, Mormont leads a party of Night's Watch rangers beyond the Wall to investigate the disappearance of Jon's uncle Benjen, assess the intentions of the wildling leader Mance Rayder and learn more of the threat posed by the Others. Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans, at any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost. As A Storm of Swords 2000 begins, Jon has gained the trust of the wildlings by killing Qhorin, and marches with their host. He learns that Mance intends to breach the Wall and march south to escape the Others, crushing the Night's Watch if necessary. Jon finds himself torn between his growing love for Ygritte and his vows of celibacy. After climbing over The Wall with Ygritte and Tormund Giantsbane, Jon deserts them to warn the Watch of the impending attack. He helps defend Castle Black against the wildlings' initial attacks despite his lack of men and weapons. Ygritte is killed in the fighting, leaving Jon stricken. When the battle is won, Jon is arrested for desertion by Thorne and Janos Slynt, but is freed after convincing the judges of his loyalty. Still suspicious, Thorne orders that Jon be sent to kill Mance under the pretense of parley, but Jon's task is interrupted by the arrival of Stannis Baratheon's army. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and declare him Lord of Winterfell if he will align the North with Stannis. Though greatly tempted at the prospect of becoming a true Stark, Jon again chooses to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. With Sam's help, Jon is elected to the position of Lord Commander by acclamation. Jon is not a POV character in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but appears briefly from Sam's perspective as he sends Sam away from Castle Black with the Watch's Maester Aemon and Mance's newborn son to protect them from sacrifice by the Red Priestess Melisandre. Jon also gives Sam the specific mission of traveling to the Citadel in Oldtown to become a maester, so that he may better understand the threat of the Others and eventually succeed Maester Aemon. In A Dance with Dragons 2011 , after sending Sam away to the Citadel to become a Maester, Jon successfully negotiates the peaceful surrender of the remains of Mance's army. He promises to settle the wildlings in sparsely populated regions of the North, and allows some of them to join the Watch to garrison the many abandoned Night's Watch fortresses. Many members of the Watch dislike the idea of allowing their ancient enemies through the Wall and welcoming them into their ranks. Jon attempts to juggle the integration of the wildlings, growing unrest within the Night's Watch, and Stannis' attempts to use the Watch in his war for the Iron Throne, while trying to maintain the Watch's strict political neutrality. Already agitated by these unprecedented developments, a group of officers led by Slynt openly defies Jon's orders. When Slynt refuses to submit, Jon executes the man himself. Stannis explains to Jon his plan to attack the Dreadfort, but Jon advises him to instead rally the Mountain Clans and attack Deepwood Motte, the fortress of House Glover recently captured by the Ironborn. Stannis does so, winning the support of the Glovers and the Mormonts. Jon learns that his sister Arya is being married to Ramsay Bolton so that the Boltons may claim Winterfell. Unaware that the bride is actually Jeyne Poole, Jon sends Mance to rescue her while Stannis marches on Winterfell. Jon later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that Stannis has been defeated and Mance is a prisoner. Ramsay demands hostages, else he will march on the Wall and kill Jon. Jon decides to seek out and kill Ramsay himself, but he is stabbed by his Night's Watch brothers seeking to uphold the Watch's neutrality before he can leave Castle Black. Jon's presence in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain when asked in 2011 by Entertainment Weekly Why did you kill Jon Snow , author Martin responded Oh, you think hes dead, do you Asked later whether Jon was killed or will survive, Martin responded with a laugh, I will not comment on that. Martin told Rolling Stone in 2014 that some early inquiries he received about adapting A Song of Ice and Fire suggested identifying the story's important character and focusing on that individual plot line Jon and Daenerys Targaryen being the two most popular choices. Martin was not interested in sacrificing so much of the overall story. When the pilot for the HBO adaptation went into production years later, one of the first parts cast was Jon, with Kit Harington announced in the role in July 2009. Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon had also auditioned for the role, and were brought into the show to play Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Snow instead, respectively. In October 2014, Harington and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. The Hollywood Reporter called the raises huge , noting that the deal would make the performers among the highest paid actors on cable TV . Deadline Hollywood put the number for season five at close to 300,000 an episode for each actor, and The Hollywood Reporter wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid upward of 500,000 per episode for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn 2 million per episode for the show. As the series premiered, TV Guide called Harington a soulful heartthrob whose Jon is idolized by his younger siblings and who seeks purpose by joining the Night's Watch. Creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss later noted that Jon tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered . They explained that he is one of several characters in the series who must face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths. The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in 2013 that while Jon and Daenerys' storylines in season 1 and season 2 felt very separate from the rest of the series' plot, for the first time in season 3, Jon's entire situation felt incorporated into the larger picture. Fowler also added that Jon's oath breaking romance with Ygritte added a lot of heat to the story . In May 2015, International Business Times called Jon clearly the most popular character of the series. In a 2015 interview Benioff said, The problem with Jon is, hes not a cautious man. It's the problem with him, and also the reason we love him. He is a hero, but heroes are inherently incautious. Weiss added, At the end of the day, Jon is his fathers son, hes a person whos honorable to a fault and does the right thing even when the right thing is extremely dangerous to him personally. In the June 2015 season 5 finale Mother's Mercy , Jon is stabbed to death by Alliser Thorne and several men of the Night's Watch after being labeled a traitor. With Martin's 2011 novel A Dance with Dragons vague on Jon's fate, Harington confirmed the character's death in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying Ive been told Im dead. Im dead. Im not coming back next season. He added, I loved how they brought Olly in to be the person who kills me. I love how the storyline with Thorne was wrapped up. Benioff also said of the episode This is obviously a big deal, the death of Jon Snow. This is something we've been thinking about for a long long time, and Alliser kills him, it's kind of like, it's a bad guy killing a good guy. But when it's Olly holding the knife ... Olly's not a bad guy. Olly's a kid whos seen just way too much horror way too early, and he makes a decision that's a really hard decision for him but you understand where he's coming from ... It's one of those great conflicts that makes us love the books and this saga, is that it's, ultimately it's not just about good vs evil, it's about people of good intentions who come into conflict with each other because they have very different views of the world, and unfortunately it did not work out well for Jon Snow in this case. Writing for The New York Times, Jeremy Egner called Jon's demise the biggest death on the show since Ned Stark's beheading in season 1. Amid strong fan reaction over Jon's death on social media, immediately following the episode journalists began theorizing how the show could resurrect the character. Nate Jones of Vulture.com noted It's easy to see what other characters' deaths meant for the series' sprawling narrative Ned's execution sent the Stark kids adrift in a universe where there was nobody looking out for them, while Robb's murder was the final death knell for the hopes that the saga would ever have a traditional 'happy' ending. What would be accomplished, narratively, by getting rid of Jon permanently right now A July 2015 sighting of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming location for the series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read throughs, prompted further speculation about the character's return. However, a story in Vanity Fair pointed out that Charles Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister's death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. Another photo that showed Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015. A season 6 Game of Thrones promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon. Jon is resurrected by Melisandre in Home , the May 2016 second episode of season 6. Though calling it a predictable move for a television series, David Sims of The Atlantic praised the plot development as the right choice for the show's narrative. In a subsequent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Harington said I'd like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear was that people were not going to care ... But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doingor the show is doingis right. Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair credited Jon's much discussed cliffhanger death as a primary factor behind Game of Thrones' subsequent 25 ratings increase for season 6. Harington's performance in season 6 earned the actor his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination in July 2016. Harington as Jon has the most screen time of any other character in the seven seasons released to date. Following the plot of A Game of Thrones, in the first season Jon, the bastard son of Ned Stark, joins the Night's Watch. He arrives at the Wall with his direwolf Ghost in tow, to find that the order is a shadow of its former self. Raised to be a talented fighter with a strong sense of justice and honor, Jon is at first contemptuous of his fellow recruits, who are mostly lowborn, untrained fighters who are criminals and exiles. In Lord Snow , he is persuaded by Tyrion Lannister to put aside his prejudices and helps some of the others with their weapons training. Jon befriends Samwell Tarly, an overweight, clumsy coward who is more an intellectual than a fighter. Jon takes his vows but is disappointed about being made steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont rather than a ranger in You Win or You Die . Sam points out that Jon is likely being groomed for command. Jon saves Mormont from a wight in The Pointy End , and in Baelor Mormont gives him the House Mormont ancestral sword Longclaw, made of Valyrian steel, with a wolf's head handle custom made for Jon, in thanks. Jon learns of his father's execution for treason in Fire and Blood , and although tempted to leave the Wall to help his family, his sense of duty ultimately compels him to stay. In the second season, Jon witnesses the wildling Craster, an old man with many wives who marries his own daughters, sacrifice his newborn son to the White Walkers in The Night Lands . Later, as part of a small scouting party led by Night's Watch ranger Qhorin Halfhand, Jon is tasked with killing a wildling prisoner, the woman warrior Ygritte. He finds himself unable to do so in The Old Gods and the New , and she escapes, only to capture him with her comrades in The Prince of Winterfell . Qhorin orders Jon to pretend to defect and join the wildlings to discover their plans. In Valar Morghulis , Qhorin stages a fight and secretly instructs Jon to kill him to gain the wildlings' trust. Jon does and is taken to meet Mance Rayder, the wildlings' King Beyond the Wall. In the third season, Jon pledges his loyalty to Mance and travels with the wildlings, learning that they intend to scale the Wall and force their way south of the Wall. Ygritte seduces Jon, and they have sex in Kissed by Fire . When Jon refuses to kill an innocent man to prove his loyalty in The Rains of Castamere , he is attacked by the other wildlings but escapes. In Mhysa , he is tracked by Ygritte, who shoots him with three arrows before he is able to escape again and return to Castle Black. In Two Swords , Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt call for Jon's execution for defecting to the wildlings, but Maester Aemon is convinced of Jon's loyalty to the Watch and sets him free. In First of His Name , Jon leads an expedition to Craster's Keep, where some men of the Watch have mutinied and murdered Lord Commander Mormont. After defeating the mutineers, Jon is reunited with Ghost. Tormund's wildlings attack Castle Black while Mance's army besieges the Wall in The Watchers on the Wall . The wildlings are successfully repelled, although Ygritte is shot and dies in Jon's arms. Before Jon can negotiate with or kill Mance, Stannis Baratheon's army arrives and routs the wildling camp, taking Mance prisoner in the season finale The Children . In The Wars to Come , Stannis enlists Jon as an intermediary between himself and Mance, hoping to add the wildling army to his own. Mance refuses to submit to Stannis, and the wildling king is burned at the stake by the red priestess Melisandre. In The House of Black and White , Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support. Jon is voted the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, initially tying with his nemesis Thorne but after the tie is broken by Maester Aemon's vote. Jon's intention to welcome the wildlings into Westeros and grant them lands south of the Wall further enrages Thorne's faction of the Watch, which holds a deep seated hatred for the wildlings. In Hardhome , Jon travels by ship north of the Wall to the eponymous wildling village, seeking their support for his plan to ally the Night's Watch and the wildlings against the growing threat of the White Walkers. As some of the wildling clans board Stannis' ships to travel south, a massive force of wights, led by White Walkers and their Night King, attacks the village. Jon kills a White Walker with Longclaw, learning that not only dragonglass, but weapons forged with Valyrian steel, can destroy them completely. Jon and his group barely make it out alive, with only a fraction of the wildling forces. Jon then permits the wildling forces to pass through the Wall into the North. Shortly after returning to Castle Black in the season finale Mother's Mercy , Jon is summoned to hear news of his missing uncle Benjen but is instead ambushed and stabbed to death by Thorne and his group of mutineers. In The Red Woman , Davos Seaworth, Dolorous Edd, and other brothers of the Watch loyal to Jon barricade themselves in a room with Ghost and Jon's body, and an attack by Thorne and his men is thwarted by the arrival of Tormund and his wildlings. Davos encourages Melisandre to attempt to resurrect Jon in Home , and although the ritual at first seems to fail, Jon suddenly awakens. After hanging Thorne, Olly, Bowen Marsh, and Othell Yarwyck for their treason in Oathbreaker , Jon gives command of the Watch to Edd and prepares to leave Castle Black. In Book of the Stranger , he is reunited with his half sister Sansa Stark, who has fled her abusive husband Ramsay Bolton and now seeks Jon's aid in crushing the Boltons. Jon is hesitant until a threatening message arrives from Ramsay demanding Sansa's return and announcing Ramsay's possession of their brother Rickon. Jon, Sansa, Davos, Tormund, and Brienne of Tarth set off to recruit an army to take back Winterfell and rescue Rickon from Ramsay in The Broken Man , but their forces grow to only half the size of Bolton's. As the armies face each other in Battle of the Bastards , Ramsay lures Jon away from his allies by forcing Rickon to run the gap between them, only to fatally shoot Rickon in the back before he can make it across. With Jon being separated from his forces, Ramsay's army closes in on him, but Jon's allies reach him in time. A devastating battle ensues in which the outnumbered Stark forces are nearly slaughtered, until the Knights of the Vale from House Arryn arrive with Sansa and Petyr Baelish, and attack the Bolton army from the rear. Jon chases Ramsay back into Winterfell and beats him savagely, stopping before killing him. Sansa subsequently feeds Ramsay to his own hounds. In the season finale episode The Winds of Winter , Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. She makes him swear to protect her son Jon. Meanwhile, the Northern lords name Jon the King in the North. Attempting to bolster the North's defenses in Dragonstone , Jon is frustrated when his authority is undermined by Sansa, who does not want him to repeat the mistakes that got their father Ned and brother Robb killed. Jon dismisses a message from Cersei Lannister that he swear his allegiance to her. In Stormborn , he receives an invitation to Dragonstone from Tyrion, on Daenerys Targaryen's behalf. Subsequently, receiving a message from Sam that a hoard of obsidian lies beneath the ancient Targaryen castle, Jon decides to meet Daenerys, leaving a surprised Sansa as his regent. At Dragonstone, he declines swearing fealty to Daenerys in The Queen's Justice and instead asks for her assistance fighting the White Walkers. She demurs but permits him to mine the obsidian. In Eastwatch , Daenerys is surprised when her dragon Drogon approaches Jon and allows the King in the North to pet him. Determined to convince Cersei that their true enemy is the army of the dead, Jon leads an expedition north of the Wall to capture a wight and bring it south to King's Landing. They manage to do so in Beyond the Wall but are surrounded by a horde of the Night King's minions. Daenerys arrives with her dragons, but the Night King kills one of them with an ice spear, forcing the others to flee without Jon. He is saved by the reappearance of his uncle Benjen, who is overtaken by the dead as Jon escapes back to the Wall. Daenerys vows to fight the White Walkers with Jon, and he agrees to swear fealty to her as his queen. In The Dragon and the Wolf , the two negotiate a truce with Cersei, who agrees to join them in fighting the Night King's forces. Samwell Tarly learns that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son and heir of Daenerys' brother Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Meanwhile, Jon and Daenerys finally give in to their growing feelings for each other and have sex, unaware that they are related by blood. In Winterfell , Jon reunites with Bran and Arya while learning the Wall has been breached by the White Walkers. Though they have readied Winterfell for battle, Sansa and many Northern lords are livid over Jon bending the knee to Daenerys, with Sansa accusing him of being in love with her. Jon's bond with Daenerys continues to grow, and he rides one of her dragons, Rhaegal. Sam, who has left the Citadel for Winterfell, tells Jon the truth about his identity as Aegon Targaryen. Jon tells this to Daenerys in the crypt before the White Walkers arrive in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms . Jon survives the events of The Long Night and receives praise. This troubles Daenerys, who fears the people of Westeros would prefer Jon over her as the heir to the Iron Throne. In The Last of the Starks , Jon assures Daenerys that he has no desire of taking the Iron Throne himself but refuses to keep his true identity and lineage secret from his family. He tells Sansa and Arya, the former seeing him as a preferable alternative to Daenerys and revealing the truth to Tyrion. Tyrion informs Varys, who implores Jon to take the Iron Throne in The Bells . Jon refuses, but begins to doubt Daenrys' benevolence, when she impulsively burns soldiers and innocents, post surrender, as well as Varys for trying to subvert her authority. In the finale, The Iron Throne , Jon listens to Tyrion, awaiting execution for treason. Jon can no longer deny how unhinged and blindly idealistic Daenerys has become, stabbing her during an embrace. Drogon spares Jon, while destroying the Iron Throne, carrying Daenerys' body off eastward. Jon is imprisoned by the Unsullied awaiting execution, however Tyrion convinces the lords of Westeros to set up a new system of kingship while the North is allowed to become an independent kingdom. Bran uses his position as the first elected King of The Six Kingdoms to arrange a compromise with Daenerys' supporters, with Jon condemned to spend the remainder of his days in the Night's Watch. In the final scene of the series, Jon is shown leaving Castle Black with Tormund, Ghost and the Wildlings to start a new life beyond the Wall. Harington was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. He said, It is a serious understatement to say that I am somewhat stunned ... For my work on Game of Thrones to be recognized in this way is an emotional moment for me. I could not be more humbled. Harington was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for the role in 2012, 2016, and 2017. His other nominations include the Golden Nymph Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series in 2012, the Young Hollywood Award for Actor of the Year in 2013, and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016. IGN also nominated Jon Snow as its Best TV Hero in 2011.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon%20Snow%20%28character%29
"Snowdon snodn Welsh Yr Wyddfa, pronounced is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of 1,085 metres 3,560 ft above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles outside the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri in Gwynedd. It is the busiest mountain in the United Kingdom and the third most visited attraction in Wales, with 582,000 people visiting annually. It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna. The rocks that form Snowdon were produced by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif has been extensively sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the aretes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest. The summit can be reached by a number of paths, and by the Snowdon Mountain Railway, a rack railway opened in 1896 which carries passengers the 4.7 miles 7.6 km from Llanberis to the summit station. The summit also houses a cafe called Hafod Eryri, open only when the railway is operating it opened in 2009 to replace one built in the 1930s. The railway generally operates to the summit station from Whitsun to October. The daily running schedule depends on weather and customer demand. The name Snowdon is from the Old English for snow hill , while the Welsh name Yr Wyddfa means the tumulus or the barrow , which may refer to the cairn thrown over the legendary giant Rhitta Gawr after his defeat by King Arthur. As well as other figures from Arthurian legend, the mountain is linked to a legendary afanc water monster and the Tylwyth Teg fairies . A 1682 survey estimated that the summit of Snowdon was at a height of 3,720 feet 1,130 m in 1773, Thomas Pennant quoted a later estimate of 3,568 ft 1,088 m above sea level at Caernarfon. Recent surveys give the height of the summit as 1,085 m 3,560 ft , making Snowdon the highest mountain in Wales, and the highest point in the British Isles outside Scotland. Snowdon is one of three mountains climbed as part of the National Three Peaks Challenge. The environment of Snowdon, particularly its rare plants, has led to its designation as a national nature reserve. In addition to plants that are widespread in Snowdonia, Snowdon is home to some plants rarely found elsewhere in Britain. These include the Snowdon lily , Gagea serotina, which is also found in the Alps and in North America it was first discovered in Wales by Edward Lhuyd, and the genus Lloydia now included in Gagea was later named in his honour by Richard Anthony Salisbury. Snowdon lies in the northern part of Snowdonia National Park, which has also provided some legal protection since the park's establishment in 1951. The rocks which today make up Snowdon and its neighbouring mountains were formed in the Ordovician Period. At that time, most of modern day Wales was near the edge of Avalonia, submerged beneath the ancient Iapetus Ocean. In the Soudleyan stage 458 to 457 million years ago of the Caradoc age, a volcanic caldera formed, and produced ash flows of rhyolitic tuff, which formed deposits up to 500 metres 1,600 ft thick. The current summit is near the northern edge of the ancient caldera the caldera's full extent is unclear, but it extended as far as the summit of Moel Hebog in the south west. Snowdon and its surrounding peaks have been described as true examples of Alpine topography . The summits of Snowdon and Garnedd Ugain are surrounded by cwms, rounded valleys scooped out by glaciation. Erosion by glaciers in adjacent cwms caused the characteristic aretes of Crib Goch, Crib y Ddysgl and Y Lliwedd, and the pyramidal peak of Snowdon itself. Other glacial landforms that can be seen around Snowdon include roches moutonnees, glacial erratics and moraines. The English name Snowdon comes from the Old English snaw dun, meaning snow hill , as Snowdon often has a covering of snow. Although the amount of snow on Snowdon in winter varies significantly, 55 less snow fell in 2004 than in 1994. The slopes of Snowdon have one of the wettest climates in Great Britain, receiving an annual average of more than 200 inches 5,100 mm of precipitation. A number of lakes are found in the various cwms of the Snowdon range. Other lakes include Llyn Du'r Arddu below Clogwyn Du'r Arddu 1,901 feet 579 m high, 5 acres 2.0 ha , Llyn Teyrn near Pen y pass 1,237 feet 377 m high, 5 acres 2.0 ha , and several smaller pools. The Snowdon Massif includes a number of cliffs, and holds an important place in the history of rock climbing in the United Kingdom. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu is often colloquially known as 'Cloggy' among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded climb in Britain, in 1798. It was carried out by Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley, while searching for rare plants. It is now considered to be one of the best cliffs in Britain for rock climbing. Y Lliwedd was also explored by early climbers, and was the subject of a 1909 climbing guide, The Climbs on Lliwedd by J. M. A. Thompson and A. W. Andrews, one of the first in Britain. Snowdon was used by Edmund Hillary and his group during preparations for their successful 1953 expedition to climb Mount Everest. The first recorded ascent of Snowdon was by the botanist Thomas Johnson in 1639. However, the 18th century Welsh historian Thomas Pennant mentions a triumphal fair upon this our chief of mountains following Edward I's conquest of Wales in 1284, which could indicate the possibility of earlier ascents. Snowdon offers some of the most extensive views in the British Isles. On exceptionally clear days, Ireland, Scotland, England, and the Isle of Man are all visible, as well as 24 counties, 29 lakes and 17 islands. The view between Snowdon and Merrick southern Scotland is the longest theoretical line of sight in the British Isles at 144 miles 232 km . Snowdon has been described as the busiest mountain in Britain , with some 557,991 people having walked up the mountain in 2018. The main paths can be combined in various ways. The circular walk starting and ending at Pen y Pass and using the Crib Goch route and the route over Y Lliwedd is called the Snowdon Horseshoe, and is considered one of the finest ridge walks in Britain . The routes are arranged here anticlockwise, starting with the path leading from Llanberis. In winter conditions, all these routes become significantly more dangerous and the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team state that additional skills, equipment and knowledge are required . Many inexperienced walkers have been killed over the years attempting to climb the mountain via the main paths. These six main paths were mapped by the Google Trekker in 2015. The 7 kilometres 4.3 mi long Llanberis Path has the shallowest gradient and is the longest route to the summit. It follows the line of the railway and being the easiest and least interesting, it is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, which has a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit. The section of the Llanberis Path beside the railway near the summit has been called the Killer Convex in icy conditions, this convex slope can send unwary walkers over the cliffs of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu. Four people died there in February 2009. The Snowdon Ranger Path Welsh Llwybr Cwellyn begins at the youth hostel beside Llyn Cwellyn, to the west of the mountain, served by the A4085 and Snowdon Ranger railway station. This was formerly the Saracen's Head Inn, but was renamed under the ownership of the mountain guide John Morton. It is thought to be the oldest path to the summit. The route begins with zigzags through turf, before reaching a flatter boggy area in front of Llyn Ffynnon y gwas. The path then climbs to Bwlch Cwm Brwynog, and then snakes along the ridge above Clogwyn Du'r Arddu towards the summit. This path meets the railway, the Llanberis Path, the Crib Goch path, and the combined Pyg Track and Miners' Track all within a short distance, just below the summit. The Rhyd Ddu path, also called the Beddgelert Path, leads from the village of Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge dropping west from the summit. It is considered one of the easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit. The total ascent from the bottom of the path to the top of the mountain is 896 meters. An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road. The Watkin Path is the most demanding route direct to the summit of Snowdon , since it starts at the lowest elevation of any of the main routes. It was first conceived by Edward Watkin, a railway owner who had attempted to build a railway tunnel under the English Channel, and had a summer home in Nant Gwynant near the start of the path. It was originally designed as a donkey track and opened in 1892. The start of the Watkin Path has been described as the prettiest beginning of the routes up Snowdon. It begins at Bethania on the A498 and climbs initially through old broadleaved woodland. After leaving the woods, the path climbs past the waterfalls of the Afon Llan to the glacial cirque of Cwm Llan, crossing a disused incline from an abandoned slate quarry. It then reaches Plas Cwmllan, formerly the home of the quarry manager for the South Snowdon Slate Works beyond, and later used for target practice by commandos during the Second World War. Near Plas Cwmllan is the large boulder known as Gladstone Rock, which bears a plaque commemorating a speech given in 1892 by William Ewart Gladstone, the then 83 year old Prime Minister, on the subject of Justice for Wales. The slate workings in Cwm Llan were opened in 1840, but closed in 1882 due to the expense of transporting the slate to the sea at Porthmadog. Various buildings, including barracks and dressing sheds, remain. From the slate quarries, the Watkin Path veers to the north east to reach Bwlch Ciliau, the col between Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, which is marked by a large orange brown cairn. From here, it heads west to meet the Rhyd Ddu Path at a standing stone shortly below the summit of Snowdon. The route over Y Lliwedd is more frequently used for descent than ascent, and forms the second half of the Snowdon Horseshoe walk, the ascent being over Crib Goch. It is reached by following the Watkin Path down to Bwlch y Saethau, and then continuing along the ridge to the twin summits of Y Lliwedd. The path then drops down to Cwm Dyli to join the Miners' Track towards Pen y Pass. The Miners' Track Welsh Llwybr y Mwynwyr begins at the car park at Pen y Pass, at an altitude of around 350 metres 1,150 ft , and is the most popular route to the summit of Snowdon. It begins by skirting Llyn Teyrn before climbing slightly to cross the causeway over Llyn Llydaw. It follows the lake's shoreline before climbing to Glaslyn, from where it ascends steeply towards Bwlch Glas. It is joined for most of this zigzag ascent by the Pyg Track, and on reaching the summit ridge, is united with the Llanberis Path and Snowdon Ranger Path. Derelict mine buildings are encountered along several parts of the path. The traverse of Crib Goch has been described as one of the finest ridge walks in Britain , and forms part of the Snowdon Horseshoe, a circuit of the peaks surrounding Cwm Dyli. The path follows the Pyg Track before separating off from it at Bwlch y Moch and leading up the East ridge of Crib Goch. All routes which tackle Crib Goch are considered mountaineering routes or scrambles. The Pyg Track Welsh Llwybr Pyg , or Pig Track both spellings may be encountered , also leads from Pen y Pass. The track climbs over Bwlch y Moch on the eastern flanks of Crib Goch, before traversing that ridge's lower slopes. Above Glaslyn, it is joined by the Miners' Track for the zigzag climb to Bwlch Glas between Snowdon and Garnedd Ugain. From the website of the Snowdonia National Park Authority, Nobody knows for certain why this path is called the Pyg Track. It's possible that it was named after the pass it leads through, Bwlch y Moch translated Pigs' Pass as the path is sometimes spelled 'Pig Track'. Or, maybe because it was used to carry 'pyg' black tar to the copper mines on Snowdon. Another possible explanation is that the path was named after the nearby Pen y Gwryd Hotel, popular amongst the early mountain walkers. Snowdon offers some of the most extensive views in the British Isles on exceptionally clear days, Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland , Scotland, England, and the Isle of Man as well as Wales are all visible, as well as 24 counties, 29 lakes and 17 islands. From here, it is also possible to see the mountains of the Peak District and South Pennines that surround Manchester. The view between Snowdon and Merrick southern Scotland is the longest theoretical line of sight in the British Isles at 144 miles 232 km . In practice, atmospheric conditions make such sightings extremely rare and indeed there are no reported sightings. The mountain itself may also be viewed on take off and approach to both Manchester Airport and Liverpool John Lennon Airport on very clear days, and even from Howth Head in Dublin, Ireland. The Snowdon Mountain Railway SMR Welsh Rheilffordd yr Wyddfa is a narrow gauge rack and pinion mountain railway that travels for 4.75 miles 7.6 km from Llanberis to the summit of Snowdon. It is the only public rack and pinion railway in the United Kingdom, and after more than 100 years of operation it remains a popular tourist attraction, carrying more than 130,000 passengers annually. Single carriage trains are pushed up the mountain by either steam locomotives or diesel locomotives. It has also previously used diesel railcars as multiple units. The railway was constructed between December 1894, when the first sod was cut by Enid Assheton Smith after whom locomotive No.2 was named , and February 1896, at a total cost of 63,800 equivalent to 7,252,000 as of 2018 . The first building to be erected at the Snowdon summit was in 1838 to sell refreshments, and a licence to sell intoxicating liquor was granted in 1845. Very basic accommodation was also provided for visitors. When the Snowdon Mountain Railway was opened in 1896, it added its own accommodation and sales outlet near the summit. During the 1930s, many complaints were received about the state of the facilities at the summit and in 1934 5 a new station building was erected in two phases. It was designed by Sir Clough Williams Ellis and included rooms for visitors and a cafe. The other operators were bought out and the ramshackle collection of buildings on the summit was cleared. The flat roof was intended to be used as a viewing platform and some photographs show it being used in this way. However, other photographs taken of the cafe show that the roof leaked, which probably explains why the practice was stopped. The Summit was taken over by government agencies during the war and the accommodation was restricted to staff use afterwards. Having become increasingly dilapidated in post war decades, this building was described by Prince Charles as the highest slum in Wales . Its state led to a campaign to replace the building. In April 2006, Snowdonia National Park Authority with the support of the Snowdonia Society agreed a deal to start work on a new cafe and visitor centre complex. By mid October 2006 the old building had been largely demolished. The new RIBA Award winning 8.4 million visitor centre, Hafod Eryri, designed by Ray Hole Architects in conjunction with Arup and built by Carillion, was officially opened on 12 June 2009 by First Minister Rhodri Morgan. The Welsh National Poet, Gwyn Thomas, composed a new couplet for the new building, displayed at its entrance and on the windows, which reads Copa'r Wyddfa yr ydych chwi, yma, Yn nes at y nefoedd The summit of Snowdon You are, here, nearer to Heaven . The name Hafod Eryri was chosen from several hundred put forward after a competition was held by the BBC. Hafod is Welsh for an upland summer residence, while Eryri is the Welsh name for Snowdonia. In Welsh folklore, the summit of Snowdon is said to be the tomb of Rhitta Gawr, a giant. This is claimed to be the reason for the Welsh name Yr Wyddfa, literally meaning the tumulus . Rhitta Gawr wore a cloak made of men's beards, and was slain by King Arthur after claiming Arthur's beard. Other sites with Arthurian connections include Bwlch y Saethau, on the ridge between Snowdon and Y Lliwedd, where Arthur himself is said to have died. A cairn, Carnedd Arthur, was erected at the site and was still standing as late as 1850, but no longer exists. According to the folklore, Arthur had Bedivere throw his sword Excalibur into Glaslyn, where Arthur's body was later placed in a boat to be carried away to Afallon. Arthur's men then retreated to a cave on the slopes of Y Lliwedd, where they are said to sleep until such time as they are needed. Merlin is supposed to have hidden the golden throne of Britain among the cliffs north of Crib y Ddysgl when the Saxons invaded. Glaslyn was also the final resting place of a water monster, known as an afanc also the Welsh word for beaver , which had plagued the people of the Conwy valley. They tempted the monster out of the water with a young girl, before securing it with chains and dragging it to Glaslyn. A large stone known as Maen Du'r Arddu, below Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, is supposed to have magical powers. Like several other sites in Wales, it is said that if two people spend the night there, one will become a great poet while the other will become insane. Llyn Coch in Cwm Clogwyn has been associated with the Tylwyth Teg fairies , including a version of the fairy bride legend. On 26 June 2018, Sam Laming became the first ever Wingsuit pilot to perform a 'Proximity Flight' over a UK mountain, by flying approximately 30 metres over Snowdon's summit, after jumping from a helicopter with fellow wingsuit camera pilot, Mike Hitchcock. The flight was met with positive press from the BBC and Daily Mail amongst various other media outlets. A video was published online shortly afterwards, showing external and point of view video from the flight. Scenes from Carry On... Up the Khyber were filmed on the lower part of the Watkin Path in 1968, with the Watkin Path representing the Khyber Pass in the film. In 2005, Angela Douglas, one of the stars of the film, unveiled a plaque at the precise location where filming took place, to commemorate the location filming, and it forms part of the North Wales Film and Television Trail run by the Wales Screen Commission.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdon
"A snowflake is a single ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate, and rime. Snow appears white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets of the snowflakes. Snowflakes nucleate around mineral or organic particles in moisture saturated, subfreezing air masses. They grow by net accretion to the incipient crystals in hexagonal formations. The cohesive forces are primarily electrostatic. In warmer clouds, an aerosol particle or ice nucleus must be present in or in contact with the droplet to act as a nucleus. The particles that make ice nuclei are very rare compared to nuclei upon which liquid cloud droplets form however, it is not understood what makes them efficient. Clays, desert dust, and biological particles may be effective, although to what extent is unclear. Artificial nuclei include particles of silver iodide and dry ice, and these are used to stimulate precipitation in cloud seeding. Experiments show that homogeneous nucleation of cloud droplets only occurs at temperatures lower than 35 C 31 F . Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air vapor onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets. This process is known as the WegenerBergeronFindeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records lists the world's largest aggregate snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana allegedly one measured 15 inches 38 cm wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime 17.91 mm in diameter have been observed. Snowflakes encapsulated in rime form balls known as graupel. Although ice by itself is clear, snow usually appears white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the scattering of light by the small crystal facets of the snowflakes of which it is comprised. The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. Rarely, at a temperature of around 2 C 28 F , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry triangular snowflakes. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing. It is unlikely that any two snowflakes are alike due to the estimated 1019 10 quintillion water molecules which make up a typical snowflake, which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground. Snowflakes that look identical, but may vary at the molecular level, have been grown under controlled conditions. Although snowflakes are never completely symmetrical, a non aggregated snowflake often grows so as to exhibit an approximation of six fold radial symmetry. The symmetry gets started due to the hexagonal crystalline structure of ice. At that stage, the snowflake has the shape of a minute hexagon. The six arms of the snowflake, or dendrites, then grow independently from each of the corners of the hexagon, while either side of each arm grows independently. The microenvironment in which the snowflake grows changes dynamically as the snowflake falls through the cloud and tiny changes in temperature and humidity affect the way in which water molecules attach to the snowflake. Since the micro environment and its changes are very nearly identical around the snowflake, each arm tends to grow in nearly the same way. However, being in the same micro environment does not guarantee that each arm grow the same indeed, for some crystal forms it does not because the underlying crystal growth mechanism also affects how fast each surface region of a crystal grows. Empirical studies suggest less than 0.1 of snowflakes exhibit the ideal six fold symmetric shape. Very occasionally twelve branched snowflakes are observed they maintain the six fold symmetry. Snowflakes form in a wide variety of intricate shapes, leading to the notion that no two are alike . Although nearly identical snowflakes have been made in laboratory, they are very unlikely to be found in nature. Initial attempts to find identical snowflakes by photographing thousands of them with a microscope from 1885 onward by Wilson Alwyn Bentley found the wide variety of snowflakes we know about today. Ukichiro Nakaya developed a crystal morphology diagram, relating crystal shape to the temperature and moisture conditions under which they formed, which is summarized in the following table below saturation above saturation Dendrites Hollow prisms Needles Solid plates Dendrites Solid plates Prisms The shape of a snowflake is determined primarily by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular. Freezing air down to 3 C 27 F promotes planar crystals thin and flat . In colder air down to 8 C 18 F , the crystals form as needles, hollow columns, prisms or needles. In air as cold as 22 C 8 F , shapes become plate like again, often with branched or dendritic features. At temperatures below 22 C 8 F , the crystals becomes plate like or columnar, depending on the degree of saturation. As Nakaya discovered, shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line trend more towards solid and compact. Crystals formed in supersaturated air trend more towards lacy, delicate and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form such as side planes, bullet rosettes and also planar types depending on the conditions and ice nuclei. If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime, at around 5 C 23 F , and then falls into the warmer plate like regime, then plate or dendritic crystals sprout at the end of the column, producing so called capped columns . Magono and Lee devised a classification of freshly formed snow crystals that includes 80 distinct shapes. They are listed in the following main categories with symbol They documented each with micrographs. The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground describes snow crystal classification, once it is deposited on the ground, that include grain shape and grain size. The system also characterizes the snowpack, as the individual crystals metamorphize and coalesce. The snowflake is often a traditional seasonal image or motif used around the Christmas season, especially in Europe and North America. As a Christian celebration, Christmas celebrates the incarnation of Jesus, who according to Christian belief atones for the sins of humanity, making them appear white as snow before God cf. Isaiah 1 18 as such, in the religious Christmas tradition, snowflakes symbolize purity. Snowflakes are also traditionally associated with the White Christmas weather that often occurs during Christmastide. During this period, it is quite popular to make paper snowflakes by folding a piece of paper several times, cutting out a pattern with scissors and then unfolding it. Snowflakes are also often used as symbols representing winter or cold conditions. For example, snow tires which enhance traction during harsh winter driving conditions are labelled with a snowflake on the mountain symbol. A stylized snowflake has been part of the emblem of the 1968 Winter Olympics, 1972 Winter Olympics, 1988 Winter Olympics, 1998 Winter Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics. Snowflakes are also seen as a symbol of uniqueness as no two are perfectly identical. In heraldry, the snowflake is a stylized charge, often used to represent winter or winter sports. Three different snowflake symbols are encoded in Unicode snowflake at U 2744 tight trifoliate snowflake at U 2745 and heavy chevron snowflake at U 2746 .

"The Snowman is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a snowman who falls in love with a stove. It was published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen as Sneemanden on 2 March 1861. Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager describes the tale as a lyrical and poignant complement to Andersen's The Fir Tree of December 1844. Wullschlager believes The Snowman was the product in part of Andersens pining and discontent over Harald Scharff, a handsome young dancer at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. According to Wullschlager, the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness. It was the only homosexual affair during Andersen's life that brought him happiness. The Snowman begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise. He is only a day old, and quite naive and inexperienced. His sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that the sun will make him run into the ditch. The dog senses a change in the weather, enters his kennel and goes to sleep. At dawn, the land is covered in frosty whiteness when a young couple enter the garden to admire the scene and the Snowman. When they leave, the dog tells the Snowman the couple are sweethearts who will someday move into the same kennel and share their bones . He then recounts happier days when he slept under the stove in the housekeeper's room as a pampered pet. The Snowman can see the stove through a window in the house and believes it is female. He falls in love. The Snowman longs to be in the room with the stove, but the dog warns him he would melt. All day the Snowman gazes upon the stove, and, at twilight, the stove glows. When the door of the room is opened, the flames leap out of the stove and glow upon the snowman's face and chest. He is delighted. In the morning, the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. The dog warns the snowman of an imminent change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the Snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the Snowman within his remains, and then understands why the Snowman longed for the stove That's what moved inside him... Now he is over that, too The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten. Scholars have noted Andersen was attracted to both men and women during his middle years. Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes, Andersen's diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men. Andersen biographer Alison Prince comments, It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others. This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet... Both believe The Snowman has its source and inspiration in Andersen's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen. In 1857 in Paris, he made the acquaintance of fellow Dane Harald Scharff, a handsome and highly regarded young ballet dancer with Copenhagen's Royal Theatre. Andersen was returning to Copenhagen via Paris following a visit to Charles Dickens in England, and Scharff was on holiday with his Copenhagen housemate, the actor Lauritz Eckardt. Andersen and Scharff toured Notre Dame together. Three years passed before Andersen again met the pair quite by accident in Bavaria in July 1860 the three men enjoyed a week together in Munich and its environs. It is probable that Andersen fell in love with Scharff at this time. According to his diary, Andersen did not feel at all well when the two young men left Munich on 9 July 1860 for Salzburg. Following the departure of Scharff and Eckardt for Salzburg, Andersen traveled to Switzerland but grew despondent and then depressed. In November, he returned to Copenhagen and spent Christmas at Basns, the estate of an aristocratic patron and friend on the coast of Zealand. His spirits lifted with the holiday festivities and The Snowman was composed on New Years Eve 1860. It was published with several other new tales by Andersen two months later on 2 March 1861 in New Fairy Tales and Stories. Second Series. First Collection. 1861. by the Copenhagen publisher C. A. Reitzel. Andersen's relationship with Scharff continued to develop and early in 1862 the two entered a relationship that brought Andersen joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness. Andersen referred to this time in his life as his erotic period , but he was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. The affair came to an end late in 1863 as Scharff gradually withdrew to focus on his friendship with Eckardt who had married an actress. Andersen noted in his diary 13 November 1863 Scharff has not visited me in eight days with him it is over. Andersen took the end of the affair calmly and the two former lovers thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness. Andersen tried several times to lure Scharff into another intimate relationship but without success. Andersen retained story ideas in his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life, and telling stories such as The Snowman was a compulsion with him. The tale has been described as poignant and lyrical, and as a self mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning, unreciprocated pain, and that he would end his life partnerless and alone. The light hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersens tragic Fir Tree and, in telling the tale, Andersen returns to his earlier, tragicomic mode of sketching the fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form. Andersen referred to The Snowman as a simple fairy tale, but the story may be viewed as a metaphor for life. The Snowman remains frozen to the ground, questioning fate, existence, and all that he sees and experiences. In this respect, the Snowman shares a common bond with Hamletboth grope for what is hidden, for the real behind the surface. But there the similarities end. Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and Alsion Prince argue that Andersen's tales are expressions of his homosexuality, and Graham Robb author of Strangers Homosexual Love in the 19th Century calls his work an Aesop of 19th century homosexuality . and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference. The Snowman is a tale about misguided love, about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove, and is Andersen's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong typewith the stove representing the danger in this wrong relationship. Andersen spent a lifetime seeking validation by women and experienced only the pain of unreciprocated love. His diaries reveal Andersen resorted to masturbation as a sexual outlet, and one critic notes that so fabulously struck out with the ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets. Andersen biographer Alison Prince believes the tale to be a parable representing the different kinds of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand in hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones . The Snowman has a different idea of love, being enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Snowman%20%28fairy%20tale%29
"The Snowmen is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, first broadcast on Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One. It is the eighth Doctor Who Christmas special since the show's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series. It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metzstein, with the special produced in August 2012, and filmed on location in Newport, Wales and Bristol. Set in the Victorian era, the story sees the Doctor Matt Smith , an alien time traveller, retired and in hiding. He is soon forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious, sentient snowmen that are building themselves and meets Clara Oswald Jenna Louise Coleman , a governess also investigating the snowmen. With the help of allies Silurian Madame Vastra Neve McIntosh , her human wife Jenny Flint Catrin Stewart , and Sontaran Strax Dan Starkey they discover that the snowmen are being animated by the Great Intelligence voiced by Ian McKellen with the help of a man named Dr Simeon Richard E. Grant . The episode builds upon the surprise introduction of the Doctor's new companion in Asylum of the Daleks , and acts as the opening component for the over arching plot for the second half of the seventh series, concerning her appearances before she is encountered in the present day in the following episode, The Bells of Saint John . The episode also introduced a redesigned TARDIS, and a change of costume for Smith's Doctor, alongside a revised title sequence and theme music to coincide with the buildup to the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. It received final ratings of 9.87 million viewers in the UK, becoming the fourth most watched programme of Christmas Day. The Snowmen was met with mostly positive reviews from critics, most of whom received the introduction and character of Clara well, but were critical over elements of the plot and the poor use of Grant and McKellen. To promote the special, three prequels were released. The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2012, titled The Great Detective . The Silurian Madame Vastra, her human wife Jenny Flint, and the Sontaran Strax describe a number of strange phenomena to the Eleventh Doctor, who tells the group that he has retired. A second prequel, titled Vastra Investigates , was released online on 17 December 2012. At the end of a case, Vastra and Jenny converse with an officer from Scotland Yard and apologise for Strax's violent wishes for the culprit's punishment. Vastra explains Strax's origins as a clone warrior from outer space as well as her own as a prehistoric intelligent reptile to the officer, much to his astonishment. Vastra reveals that she was awoken by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans, though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny. On the carriage ride home, Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and Vastra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky. A third prequel, titled The Battle of Demon's Run Two Days Later was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013. Two days after Strax's apparent death at Demon's Run, Vastra and Jenny convince him that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London. The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how Strax was resurrected and came to be in Vastra's employ. The Doctor has retired from saving people and uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax to keep people away from him while he lives in the clouds above Earth. In 1892, barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald follows the Doctor and the two of them are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting. Clara returns to her other job as governess for Francesca Latimer. Francesca has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor, and is taken to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word Pond , which arouses the Doctor's interest. The Doctor visits the Latimer family's pond. He realises that the Great Intelligence, the entity controlling a man called Dr Simeon since he was a boy and the snowmen, is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara puts Francesca to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor tries fleeing with Clara, but Clara is mortally wounded by the ice governess, which is also shattered before Simeon can get the blueprint. The Doctor tricks Simeon into opening a tin holding a memory worm inside, which latches on to him. The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence, which has been existing as a mirror of Simeon's thoughts, will vanish with the erasure of Simeon's memories by the worm. Instead, the Intelligence takes control of Simeon's body. The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly wanes, and Simeon falls dead. Outside, a salt water rain has started, and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence the Latimer family, crying for Clara. At her funeral, the Doctor reads Clara's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the same woman as Oswin, who died on the Daleks' Asylum planet. The Doctor announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara. The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The Abominable Snowmen 1967 , set in the 1930s, and The Web of Fear 1968 , set in the 1960s. In these stories, the Great Intelligence uses robot Yeti as its physical presence. The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in The Snowmen when he presents the London Underground biscuit tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr Simeon's laboratory the Intelligence states, I do not understand these markings , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin. The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a key strategic weakness in metropolitan living , referring to and possibly setting in motion the future Yeti attack on London via the Underground. Coleman previously played Oswin in Asylum of the Daleks , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until Clara reveals she has an interest in souffles, a trait that Oswin's character also had. The Doctor, after meeting Clara, wistfully replies those were the days when she asks why he isn't staying to get acquainted with her, which are the same words he tells Craig Owens Closing Time when Craig comments that the Doctor always wins. The final scenes at the graveyard establish that Clara shares the same name as Oswin, leading the Doctor to surmise they are the same person. As seen on her gravestone, Clara's birthdate is 23 November, the date Doctor Who was first transmitted in 1963. Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an epic quality to the Christmas special. The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams Moffat said that I think he's probably reached the point in his life where he's saying, 'Friendship for me is just postponed bereavement I want to be on my own for a while'. Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor William Hartnell in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s, but rejected by the production team at the time. Continuing the theme introduced with the series' first five episodes, The Snowmen was promoted like a movie. A movie poster was released in the Radio Times, showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS. The episode saw several major design changes for the series. The Snowmen is the debut of a redesigned TARDIS interior, as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune. The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor's face, the first time since Survival, the final serial of the classic series in 1989, that the Doctor's face has been seen in the title sequence. Moffat had noticed that the TARDIS' design was getting progressively whimsical and resembled more of a magical place rather than a machine. It was designed by series production designer Michael Pickwoad, who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be darker and moodier and provide an easier access to the gallery of the ship when shooting. The Doctor also wears a one off costume, Victorian themed, which the Doctor's actor Matt Smith described as a bit Artful Dodger meets the Doctor . Moffat described the new outfit as a progression as the Doctor was in a different phase of his life now and felt more grown up and fatherlike. The costume was designed by Howard Burden for this episode. The Snowmen also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes, including the Doctor dressing up as him. Moffat is co creator of the BBC series Sherlock, for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor. In addition, the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme. This episode marks the return of Jenna Louise Coleman, who previously appeared in the series opener, Asylum of the Daleks . Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith, and especially because she was able to talk faster than him. She auditioned for the role of Clara, not Oswin from Asylum , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for Clara. The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman's appearance a secret until Asylum was broadcast the effort was ultimately successful. Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made the show feel different and brought the story to a new beginning with a different person meeting the Doctor. Smith said that Clara was different from her predecessor Amy, which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor. Coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated, citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers. The Clara who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the spring premiere, The Bells of Saint John save for a brief cameo at the end of The Snowmen . Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with trust that there would be a payoff to her mystery. Also returning to the series are Neve McIntosh as Madame Vastra, Dan Starkey as Strax and Catrin Stewart as Jenny. All three previously appeared in A Good Man Goes to War and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the prequels. They returned due to the popularity of Vastra and Jenny Moffat considered a spin off featuring them, though he did not have the time to do it. Instead, he decided to bring them back in the main series. Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions, as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the Shalka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005. Smith commented that Grant was born to be a Who villain. He pitches it on that perfect level and tone . Grant's appearance in Doctor Who was teased by the BBC via Twitter, announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012. Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script, and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme. The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian McKellen. The two children Clara is governess to, Digby and Francesca, were played by real life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Darcey Alden. The Snowmen was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character however, it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012, after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special. The read through had taken place on 2 August 2012. This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales' new Roath Lock studios. Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport, Wales, while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August. Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square, Bristol, where filming took place overnight on 2122 August 2012. Bristol was chosen because it had Victorian era architecture. Pickwood stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the pub, which he said was based on a sixteenth century building in Oxford. The locations were blocked off and sprayed with fake snow. The TARDIS on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post production special effects. Director Saul Metzstein explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the snowmen the first ones he likened to Zippy from Rainbow which was too cute an appearance, and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces. Clara's introduction to the TARDIS introduced two novel effects for the show. The first was a single shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the TARDIS to its interior, with the implication of the TARDIS's trans dimensional nature shown to the audience. In the following shot, the camera does a complete circle of the TARDIS console, an effect not seen since the early days of the show. Metzstein wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the bigger on the inside than the outside nature of the time machine. In addition to the three prequel mini episodes, the cast also filmed an additional promotional video, Songtaran Carols, which the BBC uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast. The video featured Starkey singing modified versions of several Christmas songs in character as Strax as his castmates look on, before everyone breaks character and begins laughing. The Snowmen aired on BBC One on 25 December 2012 at 5 15 pm, the same day on BBC America in the US and Space in Canada and the next day on ABC1 in Australia and on Prime in New Zealand. UK overnight ratings showed that the special had been watched by 7.6 million viewers, coming in sixth for the night. Final consolidated figures not including BBC iPlayer viewers showed that the episode was watched by 9.87 million viewers, coming in fourth for the night. It also received an Appreciation Index figure of 87, higher than most of the Doctor Who Christmas specials. The iPlayer version had 1,467,220 views, making it the most popular TV show on iPlayer over Christmas. The US airing was seen by 1.43 million viewers, with a 0.6 rating in the demographic of adults aged 1849. The episode received mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave the episode an approval rating of 100 based on 7 reviews, and an average score of 8.1 10. Dan Martin of The Guardian called it actually the best Christmas Special since 'The Christmas Invasion' and the first to be actually scary , with everything we like about Doctor Who and Christmas. He praised Coleman's introduction as Clara and the gang of Vastra, Jenny, and Strax. IGN's Matt Risley gave The Snowmen a score of 9.4 out of 10, describing it as a rollicking, riveting masterclass in storytelling which refreshingly lacked traditional Christmas references in favour of some sparkling dialogue, gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation . While he felt that Grant and McKellen were underused, he was very positive towards Coleman's unpredictable Clara. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased with the return of the Great Intelligence despite an inconsistency in the timeline he found, and praised the lovely images and direction of the special, though he felt the variation of the theme music lacks the menace of the original. While he was positive towards Clara, he was unmoved by her death as it was plainly silly that she did not look injured. Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special four and a half out of five stars, writing that the power of emotion saves the day again was appropriate in light of the festivities and many fairytales referenced in the story. Setchfield was positive towards the terrific comedy with Strax, Coleman and the surprisingly underused Grant, as well as the new title sequence and TARDIS. While he wrote that the subtle callback of the Great Intelligence was a tad more interesting than the usual 'So, we meet again ' schtick , he ultimately felt their threat never quite comes into sharp relief . Neela Debnath of The Independent wrote that The Snowmen was stronger than the previous year's The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe as it was connected to the overall story of the series, but still has a way to go if it is to live up to 'A Christmas Carol' . Despite feeling that it was enjoyable , she noted that the story feels truncated and rushed The Mirror's Jon Cooper also praised Coleman and the new side of the Doctor that was shown, comparing it to Rose Tyler Billie Piper challenging the Ninth Doctor. However, he felt the character heavy story was to the detriment of the plot, which was a classic Who set up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation more set pieces than a coherent whole . He felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers, but offered much for fans in time for the programme's fiftieth anniversary. Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph gave The Snowmen three out of five stars, disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been hyped to be. While he was positive towards Smith and the TARDIS on the cloud, he criticised Strax and the Sudoku like complexity of the script. The episode was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form , alongside Asylum of the Daleks and The Angels Take Manhattan , but lost to the Game of Thrones episode Blackwater . The Snowmen was initially released as a standalone on DVD and Blu ray in the UK and North America. It was later included as part of the DVD Blu ray box set Doctor Who The Complete Seventh Series in September 2013. It has subsequently been reissued in several box set compilations, most recently alongside the Christmas specials between The Christmas Invasion and Last Christmas inclusive in a boxset titled Doctor Who The 10 Christmas Specials on 19 October 2015. Selected pieces of score from The Snowmen and the preceding Christmas special, as composed by Murray Gold, were included on a soundtrack released on 21 October 2013 by Silva Screen Records.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Snowmen
"The 1757 Battle on Snowshoes was a skirmish fought between Rogers' Rangers and French and Indian troops during the French and Indian War on January 21, 1757. The battle was given this name because the British combatants were wearing snowshoes. On January 21, 1757, Captain Robert Rogers and a band of his rangers were on a scouting expedition near Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain when they were ambushed by a mixed troop of French regulars, Canadien militiamen, and Indians. The fighting ended when darkness set in, with significant casualties on both sides. The French in their reports claimed the British had a distinct advantage due to their snowshoes. The French and Indian War broke out in 1754 between British and French colonists over territorial disputes along their colonial frontiers, and escalated the following year to include regular troops. By 1756, the French had enjoyed successes in most of their frontier battles against the British. Their only notable failure occurred when the British stopped their southward advance from Lake Champlain in the 1755 Battle of Lake George. From bases at Fort St. Frederic located at what is now Crown Point, New York and Fort Carillon known to the British as Fort Ticonderoga , the French and their Indian allies continued to scout and probe the British defenses on Lake George and the upper Hudson River. The British, who had fewer Indian allies, resorted to companies of rangers for their scouting and reconnaissance activities. The ranger companies were organized and directed by Robert Rogers, and eventually became known as Rogers' Rangers. In the winter of 1757, Rogers and several companies of his rangers were stationed at Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George and at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. These forts were principally garrisoned by elements of the 44th and 48th Regiments, and formed the frontier between the British province of New York and the French province of Canada. Captain Rogers led a scouting expedition from Fort Edward on January 15, stopping at Fort William Henry to acquire provisions, snowshoes, and additional soldiers. The company left Fort William Henry on January 17 with 86 men, heading down the frozen Lake George. The next day twelve men turned back because of injuries. The remaining men continued north, reaching Lake Champlain at a point between Fort Carillon and Fort St. Frederic on January 21. They spotted a sled moving on the lake toward Fort St. Frederic, so Rogers sent Lieutenant John Stark and some men to intercept it. However, more sleds were spotted, and Stark's men were seen before they could retreat back into the woods. The sleds turned back toward Carillon. The British gave chase, but most of the French escaped. Rogers succeeded in taking seven prisoners. Rogers learned from questioning the prisoners that a French and Indian war party had just arrived at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines , but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and were on their way south. M. de Rouilly, the leader of the supply convoy Rogers had intercepted, returned to Carillon and alerted Paul Louis de Lusignan, the fort's commander. According to Lusignan's report, he immediately sent out a party of about 90 regulars from the Languedoc regiment under the command of Capitaine de Basserode, accompanied by about 90 Canadian militia and Indians. The Indians were primarily Ottawa under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, one of the French Indian leaders at Braddock's defeat in 1755. Rogers' men then walked into an ambush, according to his estimate, by 250 French and Indians. The British were fortunate that many of the French muskets misfired due to wet gunpowder, as the surprise was nearly complete. Lieutenant Stark, who was bringing up the rear of the ranger column, established a defensive line on a rise with some of his men, from which they gave covering fire as those in the front retreated to that position. As they retreated Rogers ordered his captives slain so that his men might move more freely. The fight lasted several hours and ended only after sunset, when neither side could see the other. Rogers was injured twice during the battle, once to the head and once to the hand. The French reported that they were at a disadvantage, since they were without snowshoes and floundering in snow up to their knees . Once darkness set in, Rogers and his survivors retreated 6 miles 9.7 km to Lake George, where he sent Stark with two men to Fort William Henry for assistance. On January 23, Rogers returned to Fort William Henry with 48 able bodied and six wounded soldiers. Bougainville questioned some of the men captured during the battle. He learned from them the disposition of men and materials all the way from Albany to Fort William Henry. Other captured British ended up as slaves to the Indians. Thomas Brown, who published a pamphlet that vividly described his captivity, spent almost two years in slavery, traveling as far as the Mississippi River before reaching Albany in November 1758. A similar battle was fought the following year, in which Rogers was very nearly killed and his company was decimated.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20on%20Snowshoes%20%281757%29
"The Snowy Mountains Highway is a 333 kilometre long 207 mi state highway located in New South Wales, Australia. Its two sections connect the New South Wales South Coast to the Monaro region, and the Monaro to the South West Slopes via the Snowy Mountains. The higher altitude regions of this road are subject to snow over the winter months, and the road also provides access to many parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The highway bears the B72 shield along its entire length. The highway originally bore the name Monaro Highway until 1958, when it received its current name. It originally ran from Tathra to Wagga Wagga but has been shortened to run from the Princes Highway to the Hume Highway instead. Part of the roadway was reallocated to what is now known as the Monaro Highway in 1955. Reservoirs created as a result of dams built in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme required the creation of major realignments to avoid submerged areas. Previous to New South Wales' conversion to alphanumeric route markers, it was signed as National Route 18. The Snowy Mountains Highway begins at a T intersection with the Princes Highway at Stony Creek, north of Bega. It heads roughly west through hilly terrain, the terrain smooths eventually and the road crosses the Bemboka River at Morans Crossing. A short distance further the road passes through Bemboka, taking on the name Loftus Street within the urban area. West of Bemboka the road follows the southern bank of the Bemboka River, before crossing the Nunnock River near its confluence with the Bemboka River at the base of the Great Dividing Range escarpment. Up until this point the immediate landscape surrounding the road has so far consisted of farmland. From the base of the range the road enters South East Forest National Park and follows a steep and winding alignment up the range from about 250 m 820 ft above sea level, to over 1,100 m 3,600 ft . At the top of the range the road then enters Glenbog State Forest before once again traversing farmland for a short distance until it meets the Monaro Highway at Steeple Flat, south of Nimmitabel. This intersection is a T intersection, through traffic continues north on the Monaro Highway, while traffic heading to the south from either direction must turn. To reach the western section of the Snowy Mountains Highway the Monaro Highway must be taken north towards Cooma at this point. The western section begins at the Bombala and Sharp Street roundabout in Cooma. The highway takes on the name Sharp Street from this intersection as it heads west within Cooma urban area. Upon leaving Cooma, the road heads west via farmland to the village of Pine Valley. Here the road meets a T intersection, with through traffic taking Kosciuszko Road southwest towards Jindabyne. The highway turns to continue on its westerly heading. The roadway then makes its way through undulating terrain for some distance before it passes through Adaminaby, and on into Kosciuszko National Park. The park boundary is marked by a sign, there are no park entry gates on the highway, and park entry fees are not payable. The road winds through mountainous terrain as it climbs towards the abandoned mining settlement of Kiandra, situated at an altitude of around 1,400 m 4,600 ft . The landscape becomes open grassland at this point and remains relatively flat as the road continues relatively gently up an alpine valley created by the Eucumbene River and its numerous tributaries. At the top of the valley the road reaches its highest point a little below 1,500 m 4,900 ft . The road then descends into part of a similar valley created by the Murrumbidgee River as it passes by the access roads for Yarrangobilly Caves. The highway then veers northwest back into forested terrain and continues along the same rough heading through hilly terrain for some distance before a mountainous descent from 900 to 400 m 3,000 to 1,300 ft , near the town of Talbingo which is located a few kilometres west of the highway. Continuing on, the roadway passes by Jounama Dam and then roughly parallels the eastern side of Blowering Reservoir created by Blowering Dam further downstream . It then leaves the National Park descending into farmland on the Tumut Plains, roughly 300 m 980 ft above sea level. From here the highway then crosses the Tumut River and heads into the town of Tumut itself, taking on the names Blowering Street, Fitzroy Street, and Adelong Street within the urban area. West of Tumut the road crosses a large valley created by Gilmore Creek and Deep Creek, before a small climb through Adelong Gap into the town of Adelong, taking on the names Tumut Street, Inglis Street, and Lynch Street within the urban area. Beyond Adelong, the road continues northeast through undulating terrain before crossing Hillas Creek and then following it for the last few kilometres until the Snowy Mountains Highway's western terminus at the Hume Highway, located roughly halfway between Gundagai and Tarcutta. High altitude sections subject to snow and ice have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts which are sometimes double or triple height in contrast to the white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months. The Snowy Mountains Highway was listed as a State Highway by the New South Wales Main Roads Board MRB in their 1928 annual report. The following year, the MRB's hierarchical system which supported this listing was proclaimed with the passing of the Main Roads Amendment Act, April 1929. The highway was classified as State Highway 4, and originally known as the Monaro Highway. It ran from Tathra, via Bega, Cooma, Tumut, and various other towns and villages, to Wagga Wagga. In 1933, the Department of Main Roads DMR which had succeeded the MRB in the previous year proclaimed the portion of the Snowy Mountains Highway between Wagga Wagga and the Hume Highway at Lower Tarcutta to be part of the Sturt Highway. The Snowy Mountains Highway then terminated at its own junction with the Hume Highway instead. When the Snowy Mountains Scheme commenced in 1949, the road began to increase in importance. Roadworks to increase the standard of the road were undertaken, and were often paid for by the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority. In 1955, it was decided that what was still then known as the Monaro Highway would be renamed as the Snowy Mountains Highway. This was done as only a relatively small portion of the road was actually within the Monaro region. The section of road between Cooma and Nimmitabel was also reclassified as part of State Highway 19, which at that time ran from Canberra, to the Victorian border west of Delegate. The various roads classified as State Highway 19, were then named as the Monaro Highway in 1958. In contrast with the Snowy Mountains Highway, the entire length of that highway is within the Monaro region. Over the years further changes to the alignment have occurred. The eastern section of the highway no longer runs west to Nimittabel, instead meeting the Monaro Highway to the south the old section has been renamed as Old Bega Road. It also no longer runs east to the coast at Tathra, and now terminates where it meets the Princes Highway the section from Bega to Tathra has been renamed as Tathra Road. The western section has also seen some major changes with the highway being realigned to avoid Lake Eucumbene near Adaminaby due to the construction of Eucumbene Dam in the 1950s. Similarly realignment was required to avoid the Jounama Pondage and Blowering Reservoir near Talbingo due to the construction of Jounama and Blowering Dams in the 1960s. Route markers were first introduced in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled out to the various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, the section of the Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat. Route map",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy%20Mountains%20Highway
"Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce is an episode of the children's television program Sesame Street. Produced in 1992, it never aired because tests showed several unintended negative effects. Sesame Street has had a history of presenting difficult topics as part of its affective curriculum goals, including death, marriage, childbirth, and disaster. Extensive research was done before these episodes were written and produced, to ascertain their focus, and after they aired, to analyze the effect they had on viewers, and that was the case for Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce . The show's producers had expressed a desire to produce the episode as early as 1989, and they were convinced that it was a topic they should address after the US Census Bureau reported that 40 of American children had experienced divorce. The producers chose to present the Muppet Mr. Snuffleupagus Snuffy and his family's experience of divorce. The episode was written by staff writer Norman Stiles, who also wrote the 1983 episode in which Mr. Hooper's death was explained. Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by the Children's Television Workshop's CTW advisory board, content experts, and developmental psychologists. After tests showed that their young viewers were confused by the episode and did not understand important concepts about divorce, the producers decided to not air it, despite the investment they had made. It was the first time and only time the show's producers made this kind of decision, and was cited as an example of the producer's practice of listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first , despite the costs. Sesame Street did not address the topic of divorce until November 2012, when they produced a video for limited audiences titled Little Children, Big Challenges Divorce as part of their resiliency initiative. Sesame Street, which premiered in 1969, was the first children's television program to use a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, with specific educational goals, in its content. The show's goals included both cognitive and affective objectives. Initially, the cognitive skills of its young viewers were stressed over affective skills, which were addressed indirectly because the producers, writers, and researchers believed that focusing on cognitive skills would increase children's self esteem and feelings of competency. Eventually, after the show's first season, its critics forced its staff to address affective goals more overtly, which occurred after extensive research and planning . According to writer Michael Davis, Sesame Street's curriculum began addressing affective goals more overtly during the 1980s. For example, the producers addressed grief after the 1982 death of Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere. Author David Borgenicht called the episode poignant , and Davis called it a landmark broadcast and a truly memorable episode, one of the show's best . For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when the show's staff created a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child, Gabi. Extensive research was done before these episodes were written and produced, to ascertain their focus, and after they aired, to analyze the effect they had on viewers. The show also addressed real life disasters. For example, the producers addressed the September 11 terrorist attacks with an episode that aired in early 2002. They also produced a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Children's Television Workshop CTW, later Sesame Workshop , the organization responsible for the production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps we could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure . Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that divorce is a middle class thing, and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently. The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households. Producer director Lisa Simon stated, regarding the difficulty the producers and writers had with crafting the episode, We hope to get to it by the end of the season. It always takes us a while to figure out how to do an issue appropriately, from a child's point of view . Puppeteer Jerry Nelson, who was one of the original performers of Snuffy, noted, Now we delve into things like divorce that are likely to affect small children very heavily. We didn't touch those things before . Instead of using the human characters in the show's cast, the writers and producers decided to use Muppets to present their narrative about the effects of divorce on young children. They chose to use the family of Mr. Snuffleupagus Snuffy , a large Muppet that had been on the show since 1971. Long time cast member Bob McGrath stated, They knew they couldn't do it with either of our married couplesGordon and Susan or Maria and Luisso they tried it with Snuffleupagus, writing a show about his parents getting divorced . According to Simon, With puppets, it's slightly less frightening ... The kids have somebody to identify with. They see the puppet characters have feelings and work through a difficult issue many of them will have to face . Staff writer Norman Stiles, who also wrote the episode in which Mr. Hooper's death was explained, was assigned to compose the script. Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by CTW's advisory board, content experts, and developmental psychologists. The episode featured Gordon explaining the concept of divorce, Snuffy being assured that his parents still loved him, and the characters talking and singing about how Snuffy will have good homes, and so on and so on . As with the Mr. Hooper episode, Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce was studied extensively for comprehension and attention. After it was filmed, it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers. The results found several unintended negative effects. As The Christian Science Monitor said, it bombed . Despite Gordon's reassuring the Muppets Elmo, Big Bird, and Telly, children believed that their parents' arguments would lead to their divorce. They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice's parents loved them despite the divorce, were unclear where the characters' parents lived especially their father, who had never appeared on the show before . Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again. According to Singer, The kids came away with negative messages ... The kids misunderstood arguments. They said arguments did mean divorce. Some thought Snuffy's parents were moving away even though we said just the opposite. A number said the parents would no longer be in love with them . Based upon their findings, and despite the expense and their intention to air Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said, They wrote a whole show and taped it, and it was just devastating for test groups of kids. So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3 year old . CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going back to the drawing board , and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce . According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, it was the first time the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first . Sesame Street did not address the subject of divorce until November 2012, when its producers created, as part of their resiliency initiative, Little Children, Big Challenges Divorce. It was made available to military families and to the general public through family courts, counseling services, and parenting and child care programs. It included a 22 minute DVD, a caregiver guide, a storybook, a tip sheet for extended families and friends, mobile apps and social networking sites, and an online toolkit. Like in Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce , the Little Children, Big Challenges production also used a Muppet, Abby Cadabby, to represent the child experiencing divorce. Whereas Snuffy was shown going through it in real time, Abby's parents' divorce was in the past, which gave her time to adjust.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuffy%27s%20Parents%20Get%20a%20Divorce
"Snuppy Korean a portmanteau of SNU and puppy April 24, 2005May 2015 was an Afghan hound, the first dog clone. The puppy was created using a cell from an ear from an adult Afghan hound and involved 123 surrogate mothers, of which only two produced pups Snuppy being the sole survivor . The Department of Theriogenology and Biotechnology at Seoul National University, which cloned Snuppy, was led by Woo Suk Hwang. Snuppy has since been used in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines after his sperm was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females, which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies in 2008. In 2017, 4 clones of Snuppy were made by Sooam, and were the first clones made of a cloned dog, to investigate potential health effects of cloning. After Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996, scientists had managed to clone numerous other animals, including cats, cows, gaur, horses, mice, mules, pigs, rabbits and rats but had been unsuccessful in cloning a dog due to the problematic task of maturing a canine ovum in an artificial environment. After several failed attempts by other scientists, Woo Suk Hwang, a lead researcher at Seoul National University, created a clone using tissue from the ear of a 3 year old Afghan hound. 123 surrogate mothers were used to carry the embryos, of which 1,095 were implanted, the procedure resulted in only three pregnancies one resulted in a miscarriage, the other pup was born successfully but died of pneumonia three weeks after birth, the successful clone was carried by a Labrador Retriever. From the original 1,095 embryos to the final two puppies, this placed the success rate of the project at less than two tenths of a percent. Snuppy was named as a portmanteau of the initials of the Seoul National University SNU and the word puppy . As the eggs in a female canine are only fertile during the estrus phase of the estrous cycle, the eggs could only be harvested during a three week period each year. Due to complexities with removing eggs from canine ovaries the eggs had to be extracted from the oviduct, which required constant monitoring to achieve. The nucleus of each egg was replaced with the cell from the ear of the adult dog and then electrified and fused using a chemical reaction. The embryos were then transferred to the surrogate dogs. Three of the surrogate mothers became pregnant and two gave birth. Snuppy, the first to be born, survived while the other died two weeks after birth. This process of cloning Snuppy took nearly three years of intensive effort. Snuppy was named as Time Magazine's Most Amazing Invention of the year in 2005. Particular recognition was given to the cloning technique used in the process, which Time stated was embodied by a history making puppy . Despite numerous labs performing mammalian cloning, they hailed the achievements of Hwang's team as extraordinary . The experiment was criticized by Robert Klitzman, director of Columbia University's Masters in Bioethics program, who said that the process raised the question of whether humans are just a mass of cells and biological processes Hwang himself criticized the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate one in 123 , did not make it ethical to clone family pets. Ian Wilmut, the scientist behind the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep, said that the successful cloning of Snuppy proved that any mammal could be cloned in the correct environments and that a global ban on human cloning needed to be quickly implemented because of this. The Kennel Club criticised the entire concept of dog cloning, on the grounds that their mission is to To promote in every way the general improvement of dogs and no improvement can occur if replicas are being created. Between late 20052006 Hwang was accused of a series of incidents of misconduct. The first allegations related to his work prior to Snuppythe claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of the eggs came from his employees, which would constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones at all. This brought serious doubts about the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed on the grounds that they were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university. Veterinary professor Byeong Chun Lee took over leadership of the team behind Snuppy. In 2008, Snuppy became involved in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines, after sperm taken from Snuppy was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females, which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies. Nine of the puppies survived. The SNU team, under Lee, have gone on to clone over 30 dogs and five wolves. SNU, which claimed to own the patent for the process used to clone Snuppy, formed a license agreement with RNL Bio, a commercial pet cloning company. Hwang entered into a partnership with RNL Bio's competitor, BioArts International, which caused an ongoing legal battle into who owns the patent rights although Bio Arts withdrew from dog cloning in 2009. RNL completed the first commercial cloning in August 2008 but ran into financial trouble in 2013. The world's first cloned sniffer dogs all of which are named Toppy were put to work by South Korean customs in July 2009. Supporters of Hwang founded a company called Sooam Biotech where Hwang developed proprietary techniques based on a licence from ViaGen's subsidiary Start Licensing which owns the original Dolly patent and created cloned dogs for owners whose dogs had died, charging 100,000 a time Sooam Biotech was reported to have cloned 700 dogs by 2015 and to be producing 500 cloned embryos of various species a day in 2016. Snuppy died in May 2015 at the age of 10.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuppy
"Snyder originally Snyderville is a hamlet within the town of Amherst in Erie County, New York, United States that is part of the Buffalo Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The hamlet was established in 1837. It was named for Michael Snyder, its first postmaster, who also operated a store at the corner of Harlem Road, which is also known as New York State Route 240, and Main Street, which is also known as New York State Route 5. The hamlet blossomed due to retail activity demand created along the Main Street transportation route between Buffalo and points to the east in the 19th and early 20th century. As of 2009, the hamlet has several commercial districts, including a modest business district along Main Street that includes the original town focal point at Main Street and Harlem Road, and several educational institutions. The educational institutions are both public and private and range from kindergarten through college. The Snyder community has above average affluence and education compared to the Buffalo region. The hamlet also hosts two structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places that serve as architectural artifacts of the early residential developments in the hamlet. The traditional definition of the hamlet is the Snyder postal service area, now merged into the 14226 zip code. However, using United States Census Bureau based data, which does not necessarily align exactly with the old postal boundaries, the modern definition includes parts of the neighboring Eggertsville hamlet. In 1804, Timothy Hopkins was the first settler in the area that would later become Snyderville and subsequently Snyder. Hopkins married Nancy Kerr in Williamsville in the first marriage on record in Erie County. As newlyweds, they moved to a log cabin on a farm on the 4301 Main Street location of Amherst Central High School. The Schenck family moved to Amherst at the corner of Main Street and Harlem Road in 1821. Abraham Snyder arrived from Pennsylvania in 1823 and moved to a spacious frame house in the late 1830s. His son Michael rose to prominence. John Schenck, Michael Snyder's cousin, built the hamlet's first house and later built the first store in 1837, which was the year the hamlet was first established. In 1830, a stagecoach was established. It was the first regularly scheduled public means of transportation between Buffalo and Batavia, and sometimes Albany, and operated along Buffalo Road, which was later renamed Main Street. By the 1850s, the Amherst economy thrived on agriculture. Snyder also had a pottery and brick factory. Throughout the 19th Century Snyder evolved as a small scale business community catering to surrounding farmers and the stagecoach line along Main Street. In 1879, the hamlets of Amherst began receiving newspaper service from the Amherst Bee, which continues to exist as of the beginning of the 21st century as a weekly newspaper. L. F. Crout opened a hotel in 1883. In 1892, an electric trolley, which ran from Main Street and Bailey Avenue, also known as U.S. Route 62, into Williamsville, connected Amherst with the city of Buffalo's streetcar system. This made Amherst's various hamlets more accessible and desirable to the wealthier city residents who were interested in expanding their estates into the country . This caused growth and development of the Main and Harlem area which served as the center of town for the new suburbs. In 1905, the Snyderville Fire burned 12 buildings in the Main Street Harlem Road area, including blacksmith shops, barns, and other businesses critical to the Snyder economy as well as livestock and stores of grain. In the 1920s, the town of Amherst began to develop by converting farmland into subdivisions. Snyder residents began to live closer to each other in new subdivisions. Snyder is located in the southern part of Amherst, which is located in Erie County, New York, United States. As a hamlet it has no formal boundaries, but was originally defined by the area served by its post office. The traditional boundaries of the hamlet are Getzville and Brantwood Road on the west, Sheridan Drive, also known as New York State Route 324, on the north, I 290, known as the Youngmann Expressway I 90, known as New York State Thruway on the east, and the Cheektowaga town line along Wehrle Drive east of Harlem Road and then Winspear Avenue on the south. When defining the Snyder community market area using census data, the western boundary extends a little further to include parts of the hamlet of Eggertsville, which was built around the Main Street and Eggert Road intersection, with a western boundary from north to south of Millersport Highway, also known as New York State Route 263, Longmeadow Road, Westfield Road, Main Street, LeBrun Road, and Eggert Road. When defined this way, Snyder includes using a Main Street and Harlem Road origin, starting with the northwest quadrant, and moving clockwise census block groups 13 from census tract 94.01 census block groups 3 4 from census tract 94.02 census block groups 35 from census tract 95.02 and census block groups 1, 35 from census tract 95.01. The center of town at Main Street and Harlem is at an elevation of 673 feet 205 m . The business district is located between Burroughs Drive to the east and Campus Drive to the west on Main Street. In this region, the Snyder Fire Department, the Eggertsville Snyder Branch of the Buffalo Erie County Public Library 4622 Main Street , the Amherst YMCA 4433 Main Street , and the Main Harlem Plaza as well as the former location of the United States Postal Service office for the 14226 zip code that includes Snyder and the neighboring hamlet of Eggertsville are located. The post office for the zip code was formerly located at Main Street and Chateau Terrace with a 25 Chateau Terrace address until May 1, 1990. Harlem road crosses through the business district and connects three of the hamlet's four commercial districts. Sheridan Harlem Plaza and adjacent commercial property are located at the north end of Harlem. Both Kensington Avenue and Wehrle Drive intersect the southern part of the Snyder portion of Harlem in a commercial region that extends into Cheektowaga. The HarlemKensington commercial district is historic. The fourth commercial district is located in the eastern edge of the hamlet at the intersection of Main Street and Kensington Avenue near the entrance to the Youngmann Expressway. The extended Snyder community has additional commercial areas along the highly commercial Sheridan Drive and on Millersport Highway. Snyder is bounded by I 290, and has two interchanges on the eastern edge of the hamlet with this interstate highway that are both less than a 1 mile 1.6 km from the Main and Harlem center of town. This provides direct access to the I 90 The New York State Thruway and continuing south on Harlem to the New York State Route 33 a little more than a mile from Snyder through Cheektowaga also provides access to the I 90. The community is also serviced by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority NFTA , which provides three different bus routes 30, 48, and 49 connecting directly to the light rail Buffalo Metro Rail along Main Street to the west. All three of these routes connect to various parts of Williamsville to the east and provide connections to Erie Community College north campus , the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Transit Road New York State Route 78 . The hamlet is also serviced by NFTA route 65 from downtown Buffalo along Kensington Avenue to Main Street and the service continues to northeast Erie County destinations. Historically, transportation through town has been active on Main Street. In 1836, the street became a Macadam toll road. On April 5, 1893, the trolley line opened for business between Main Street and Bailey Avenue and the east end of Williamsville 4.5 miles 7.2 km to the east. It was later extended another 3 miles to Transit road. The hamlet has two National Register of Historic Places listings Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive and Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard. The former were built in 1926 and the latter in 1918. Both were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2005. These stone wall entrances to residential developments are common throughout Eggertsville and Snyder along Main Street and serve to give residential developments the appearance of having entrances similar to the former grand estates that were previously common along Main Street in the area. Willard Genrich built the Lord Amherst Motor Hotel on Main Street near the I 290 interchange on Main Street to harmonize with the colonial architectural motif used by the local Main Street businesses. Snyder is an affluent and well educated community in Metropolitan Buffalo. The residential population consists mostly of large single family homes on individual lots. The 2000 United States Census average household income of 87,700 127,593 today far exceeds the Buffalo regional average of 57,400 83,510 . The Snyder population declined from 14,294 to 13,875 while the number of households increased from 5,469 to 5,574 between the 1990 United States Census and the 2000 United States Census. During the decade the number of children age 517 and adults age 3554 grew significantly while the young adults age 1834 and adults over the age of 55 declined sharply. The number of housing units grew from 5,662 to 5,739. 1990 housing was 82.5 single family housing. The busiest ATM in the entire Buffalo region is in Snyder. The traditionally defined Snyder portion of Main Street had 180 businesses as of January 2002. The town has two theatres Musical Fare Theater is a not for profit corporation on the Daemen College campus and Fisher Towne Theater. Starting in the 1950s zoning laws required that all new buildings be set back from the street and have private on site parking. The 21st Century zoning laws date back to 1976. There is no formal Snyder government. The hamlet, like the rest of the town of Amherst, is served by the Town of Amherst Government and receives municipal services from the town. It is serviced by entities such as the Amherst Police Department, Snyder fire department and the Town of Amherst Highway Department, although Main Street and Harlem Road are serviced by the New York State Department of Transportation. Residents of Amherst, including those in Snyder, pay taxes both to the Town of Amherst and the County of Erie. However, the town tax is solely a school tax and the county collects the remaining town taxes for municipal services. Amherst Central High School, the town's public high school, is located at 4301 Main Street, just west of the business district. The school started when the new Amherst school district was created in the late 1920s. Previously students from Eggertsville and Snyder either attended Bennett High School at 2885 Main Street in Buffalo or what is now called Williamsville South High School at 5950 Main Street in Williamsville and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Williamsville Junior and Senior High School. Daemen College is located across from the high school at 4380 Main Street.

"So is the fifth studio album by English singer songwriter Peter Gabriel, released on 19 May 1986 by Charisma Records. After working on the soundtrack to the film Birdy 1984 , producer Daniel Lanois was invited to remain at Gabriel's home during 1985 to work on his next solo project. Initial sessions for So consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes, although these grew to include a number of percussionists. Although Gabriel continued to use the pioneering Fairlight CMI synthesizer, songs from these sessions were less experimental than his previous material. Nevertheless, Gabriel drew on various musical influences, fusing pop, soul and art rock with elements of traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian styles. It is Gabriel's first non eponymous album, So representing an anti title that resulted from label pressure to properly market his music. Gabriel toured So on the This Way Up tour 19861987 , with some songs performed at human rights and charity concerts during this period. Often considered his best and most accessible album, So was an immediate commercial success and transformed Gabriel from a cult artist into a mainstream star, becoming his best selling solo release. It has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album's lead single, Sledgehammer , was promoted with an innovative animated music video and achieved particular success, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and subsequently winning a record of nine MTV Video Music Awards. It was followed by four further singles, Don't Give Up a duet with Kate Bush , Big Time , In Your Eyes and Red Rain . The album received positive reviews from most critics, who praised its songwriting, melodies and fusion of genres, although some retrospective reviews have criticised its overt commercialism and 1980s production sounds. So was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987 but lost to Paul Simon's Graceland. It has continued to appear in lists of the best albums of the 1980s and was included at number 187 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. So was remastered in 2002, partially re recorded for Gabriel's 2011 orchestral project New Blood and issued as a box set in 2012. Since 1978, Gabriel had composed his music at Ashcombe House, including his album Security 1982 and the Birdy soundtrack 1984 . He had an inexpensive studio in the house's adjacent barn consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. Preparing for So, Gabriel considered Bill Laswell and Chic's Nile Rodgers as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator Daniel Lanois to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had a nice starting point in that kind of scenario, it's not a good idea to have a lot of people around because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time . Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as the Three Stooges , an American vaudeville act of the mid twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a turning up for work humour . As sessions grew, engineer mixer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katche and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar. The studio's basic equipment consisted of two analog 24 track machines, a Studer A80, and a Studer A80 shell that had been modified by a local electronics wizard, with its own audio cards and transport controls . To record vocals a Neumann U47 tube microphone and a Decca compressor were used without equalization. All of So's songs were made in a similar format. Gabriel would record a piano demo on a modified B machine and play this to the band. During rehearsals, the band would listen to the B machine through headphones and record their output onto the A machine parts of Gabriel's demo would also be transferred to the A machine at this stage. Subsequent takes of the song were then put onto the B machine in order for the band to hear what they had played with the demo, as well as the song's new and old takes. Other equipment included the groundbreaking Fairlight CMI synthesizer, which Gabriel said in an interview for Billboard meant more human imagination is involved . He added, the creative decision making process has become more important than technique. You have a wider range of tools, a wider range of decisions . Although remaining continually inspired to produce new music, he often struggled to write lyrics and would procrastinate. His proclivity to being dissatisfied with them required Killen to isolate certain vocal performances as the master track, in order to keep other tracks available so new lyrics could be edited in. Lanois took adverse measures to encourage his writing, such as destroying his much used telephone in the nearby woods and, on one occasion, nailed the studio door shut to lock him inside. Towards the end of recording, Gabriel became obsessed with the track listing and created an audio cassette of all the song's beginnings and ends to hear how the sounds blended together. He wanted to have In Your Eyes as the final track, but its prominent bassline meant it had to be placed earlier on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate. With later CD releases, this restriction was removed and the track was placed at the end of the album. So was completed in February 1986 and cost 200,000 to make. It was over dubbed at Power Station Studios in New York, despite Gabriel considering sending it via a computer telephone set up, reasoning, that's a lot of information to send via phone. Isn't it amazing though You can send a song idea around the world to musicians then beam parts back by satellite . It was mastered by Ian Cooper in mid February 1986 at London's Townhouse Studios. So has been described as Gabriel's most commercially accessible and least experimental album, one that features pop songs and incorporates art pop and progressive pop throughout. Like his previous albums, its basis is in art rock, although on So, Gabriel develops an increased focus on melody and combines this with elements of soul and African music. With a song like the previous album's 'The Rhythm of the Heat' or 'The Family and the Fishing Net', if I were to strum that along on a guitar or piano, the song might not work very well ... whereas more of the things on this album do work just as lyric, melody and chords in a more traditional sense. The songs are highly influenced by traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian music, with Gabriel using the distinctive drum beat from these styles. In a 2011 interview for Uncut, Gabriel said, I'd had my fill of instrumental experimenting for a while, and I wanted to write proper pop songs, albeit on my own terms. Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes that Gabriel doesn't just add on African drums or Indian violin to ordinary songs they are part of the foundation. Chris Roberts of Classic Rock also notes that the album the Fairlight synth and a palatable dash of world music to art pop. Daniel Lanois' production was noted as textured, replete with ambient details and immaculate warmth giving each note room to breathe, its textures lavish in the preferred style of the time without being sterile . Gabriel wanted the album to crash open at the front . Despite disliking metal percussion instruments, he was persuaded by Lanois to allow The Police's Stewart Copeland to play cymbals and hi hat on its opener, Red Rain. Gabriel sings in his upper register, with a throaty, gravely texture of a destructive world with social problems such as torture and kidnapping. Its concept originated from a dream in which he envisaged the parting of a vast, red sea and human like glass bottles filling up with blood. It was also intended to continue the story of Mozo, a recurring character on Gabriel's first and second albums. Sledgehammer was the final track to be conceived. Most of Gabriel's band had packed away their equipment and were ready to leave the studio, but he asked them to reassemble to quickly run through a song he had an idea for. Sledgehammer was partially inspired by the music of Otis Redding, and Gabriel sought out Wayne Jackson, whom Gabriel had seen on tour with Redding in the 1960s, to record horns for the track. Opened by a shakuhachi bamboo flute, its beat is dominated by brass instruments, particularly Jackson's horn, and features lyrics abundant with sexual euphemisms. Manu Katche's drums were recorded in one take as he believed any subsequent version would be inferior to his original interpretation of the music. So's most political statement, Don't Give Up, was fuelled by Gabriel's discontent with rising unemployment during Margaret Thatcher's premiership and Dorothea Lange's photograph Migrant Mother . The track began as a rhythm pattern of slow, low pitched tom tom drums that Gabriel made, and Lanois believed could serve as the centrepiece of a song. Tony Levin added bass to create a more harmonious sound, and during the second half of the track, put a nappy behind his bass strings to dampen the sound. Gabriel ensured the song, which follows a narrative of an unemployed man and his lover, was written as a conversational piece. He initially sought Dolly Parton to portray the woman, although Parton declined his friend Kate Bush agreed to feature. Bush serves as the song's respondent, she assumes a comforting role and with delicate vocals, sings lines such as Rest your head you worry too much . The album's first side culminates with That Voice Again, in which Gabriel explores the concept of conscience, examining the parental voice in our heads that either helps or defeats us . Co written with David Rhodes, who plays guitar over Katche and Levin's input, the song was written after Gabriel's initial discussions with Martin Scorsese about scoring The Last Temptation of Christ 1988 . In Your Eyes has been described as Gabriel's greatest love song. Inspired by the Sagrada Familia and its architect Antoni Gaudi, Gabriel sings over a drumbeat of only feeling complete in the eyes of his lover. The track's powerful atmosphere is created through the singing of Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour, who sings in his native language. Gabriel became interested in the late American poet Anne Sexton after reading the anthology To Bedlam And Part Way Back. He dedicated So's sixth track to her, calling it Mercy Street after 45 Mercy Street , a poem released in another posthumous collection. Mercy Street is set to one of several Forro inspired percussion compositions that Gabriel recorded in Rio de Janeiro. When these compositions were unearthed in the studio, they were accidentally played back ten per cent slower than the original recording, giving them a grainy quality that Gabriel and Lanois thought highlighted the cymbal and guitars. It features two harmonious Gabriel vocals one a shadow vocal an octave below the main vocal. Intended to give a sensual, haunting effect, this was hard to capture except when Gabriel first woke up. The dance song Big Time has funk influences and is built on a percussive bass sound . Its lyrics satirise the yuppie culture of the 1980s, materialism and consumerism and are the result of Gabriel's self examination, after he considered whether he may have desired fame after all. We Do What We're Told Milgram's 37 was recorded for Peter Gabriel or Melt and is described as an interlude. It references the experiment on obedience carried out by American social psychologist Stanley Milgram, intended as a reference to the obedience citizens show to dictators during times of war. Marotta's drums on the song said to resemble a heartbeat heard from the womb were coupled with Shankar's violin and two overdubbed guitar tracks by Rhodes . While We Do What We're Told was the final song on initial LP versions of the album, the cassette and CD releases are completed by This Is The Picture Excellent Birds , which Gabriel decided to include, forty eight hours before the album's submission. Excellent Birds was composed with American musician Laurie Anderson and featured on her 1984 album Mister Heartbreak. This was interpolated with a recording called This Is The Picture , on which Nile Rodgers plays rhythmic guitar. Prior to the song's inclusion on So, Anderson and Gabriel performed it during the 1984 global satellite television broadcast Good Morning, Mr. Orwell. So is Gabriel's first non eponymous album. Gabriel has noted his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an interview for Rolling Stone, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security. He elaborated that for So decided to go for the anti title ... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something with meaning and intention. And that's what I've done ever since . When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named So, it was meant to be entitled Good. The album's cover is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells 1973 . The sleeve was designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens Saville was best known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists and was paid 20,000 for his work on So. Gabriel recalled The only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville's idea for a retro style portrait. I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women. The cover was partly influenced by photographer David Bailey's work. So was released on 19 May 1986. It topped the charts of seven countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, where it became Gabriel's second number one album. In the United States, So became one of Geffen Records' most commercially successful releases, peaking at number two and remaining on the chart for ninety three weeks. In April 1986, Sledgehammer was released as the album's lead single and became Gabriel's first and only number one on the Billboard Hot 100, displacing Genesis' first and only US number one Invisible Touch . The track reached number four in the United Kingdom, where it ties with Games Without Frontiers as his highest charting single, and peaked at number one in Canada. The success of Sledgehammer can be seen, in part, due to its hugely popular and innovative stop motion music video, designed by Aardman Animations. Gabriel would go on to say in an interview for Rolling Stone that he believed the video exposed So's songs to a wider audience, bolstering the album's success. Two high charting singles followed, Don't Give Up , which rose to number nine on the UK Singles Chart and a less successful seventy nine in America, while Big Time peaked at number thirteen in the UK and number eight in America. In Your Eyes saw moderate success in America, where it reached twenty six on the Hot 100, while Red Rain peaked at forty six in the United Kingdom. Bono contacted Gabriel to perform at A Conspiracy of Hope, a series of Live Aid inspired concerts that intended to spread awareness of human rights issues in light of Amnesty International's twenty fifth anniversary. Gabriel accepted and in June 1986, he performed alongside Sting, The Police, Lou Reed and Joan Baez, with a set that opened with Red Rain and featured Sledgehammer . Gabriel described it as the best tour he'd ever been on . In the same month, Gabriel performed at London's Clapham Common, along with Boy George and Elvis Costello, for Artists Against Apartheid. Gabriel eventually embarked on the ninety three date This Way Up tour to support So, beginning in Rochester, New York on 7 November 1986. One of the dates was a special two night residency 2021 December at Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Stadium to fund a global computer system for the University for Peace, a United Nations project. The tour suspended in early 1987 until June when it reached Europe, before going on to America and finishing at the Lycabettus Amphitheatre in Athens in October. Gabriel partially performed So at The Prince's Trust Concert and at Human Rights Now Tour in 1988. So received mostly favourable reviews from music critics. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote only a handful of Western rock musicians have managed to use exotic rhythms and instruments with so much ingenuity and conviction . Pareles also praised his vocals, describing them as grainy but not bluesy, ageless and joyless, the voice of some ancient mariner recounting disasters . Tim Holmes writing for Rolling Stone described the album as a record of considerable emotional complexity and musical sophistication and was pleased that the records would assist exposing Gabriel to mainstream pop music. Terry Atkinson of Los Angeles Times viewed the album as offering an amazing variety of tones, moods, and topics and a consistently powerful level of expression . Although disliking Big Time , Atkinson concludes So is a great album, possibly Gabriel's best . Steve Hochman, also of Los Angeles Times, praised Gabriel's reinvention too, describing it as real progress compared to the contemporaneous work of other progressive rock acts such as Genesis, GTR and Marillion. Chicago Tribune's Lynn Van Matre praised the album's wave of funky rhythms and called for more appreciation of Gabriel's talent, but noted a lack of quirkiness and said there were no tracks as impactful as his 1980 single Biko . Robert Christgau was also lukewarm in The Village Voice, writing that Gabriel's so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go, which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn't get him up on the onesmart guys do go for texture in a pinch. So has continued to perform well in most retrospective reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commended So as the catchiest, happiest record he ever cut . Erlewine particularly praised Gabriel's fusion of art rock with African music and soul. Jude Rogers of the BBC wrote once you look past the bombast of Sledgehammer , ... you notice how easily its artful ideas slipped inside the 80s mainstream . The Quietus' Wyndham Wallace praised So's sincerity and called it a heartfelt journey through intense emotional territory, assembled and arranged with intricacy and commitment, laboured over with such care that it sounds effortless . Ryan Bray, writer for Consequence of Sound, concluded So was an all too rare record that manages to have it both ways, earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving so much as an artistic inch . He added that it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s . Mark Blake of Q described the album as carbon dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths . He added that Gabriel crafted an album of user friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd. Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence. Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole . In a less positive retrospective review, Mojo's David Buckley contrasted the album with Gabriel's earlier, more experimental work, claiming on 1986's So, he switched tack to write pop, and write big. The results are mixed. 'Sledgehammer', echoing both Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition' and David Bowie's 'Fame', retains its punch. Elsewhere, Gabriel sounds airbrushed on 'Mercy Street', 'Red Rain' and 'In Your Eyes', with only 'We Do What We're Told' a reminder of a daring past. Writing in Uncut, John Lewis also directed criticism at the album. He praised its state of the art production in parts, highlighting Big Time and Sledgehammer as standout tracks, but claimed elsewhere it interfered, such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer on That Voice Again and whistling ambient accompaniment on Mercy Street . 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die At the 29th Annual Grammy Awards, So was nominated for Album of the Year, losing to Paul Simon's Graceland 1986 , while Sledgehammer received nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. At the sixth Brit Awards, hosted by Jonathan King at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, Gabriel won Best British Male Artist and Sledgehammer won Best British Music Video. Gabriel was most successful at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards where he was honoured with the Video Vanguard Award and Sledgehammer won an additional nine awards including Video of the Year, a record that has not been challenged. Its video is the most played music video in the history of MTV. So is often regarded as Gabriel's best album, as well as one of the best albums of the 1980s. It enabled Gabriel to transform from a cult artist, acclaimed for his cerebral, experimental solo work, into a mainstream, internationally known star. Rolling Stone placed So at 187 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and at 14 on its 100 Best Albums of the 1980s, noting that despite its mass appeal, however, So also presented compelling challenges. Stereogum placed it at number one on its list of Gabriel's best albums, writing, Peter Gabriel's fifth studio album is a mesmerizing dichotomy simultaneously hooky and experimental timeless, yet completely crystallizing its moment in history ... It's a masterpiece. So has been profiled in the Classic Albums series and featured in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Slant Magazine listed the album at 41 on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s, describing it as Gabriel's most accessible yet ambitious work. A chronicle of political, emotional, and artistic exploration, the album to balance standard pop orthodoxy with his still rumbling desire for sonic experimentation . Jim Allen wrote for Ultimate Classic Rock, What makes So important is the way he seamlessly blended peerless pop savvy with an iconoclasts adventurous artistic instincts. His slightly twisted pop songs packed enough emotional impact, sonic surprises and catchy melodies to make for one of the eras most consistently rewarding records. Conversely, in 2002 The Guardian's lead critic Alexis Petridis claimed Gabriel had suffered a musical mid life crisis , describing it as an album packed with ultra commercial priapic cod funk and a ruthless bid for mainstream success . So is Gabriel's best selling album, having been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry BPI . In 2002, So was re issued and remastered. In 2011, several of tracks from So were featured on Gabriel's ninth studio release New Blood, a project of orchestral re recordings from Gabriel's discography. In 2012, for the album's twenty fifth anniversary, a limited edition box set was released. It includes the remastered So album, the Live at Athens 1987 album and a So DNA album which examines its production, as well as new liner notes, photographs, vinyl collectibles and the So Classic Albums documentary. In the same year, Gabriel embarked on the Back to Front Tour where Gabriel plays every song on the So album with several of the session musicians from its recording. Michael Glabicki of the American band Rusted Root acknowledges this album as a key influence on his own career exploring worldbeat music, saying, I just kind of got locked into that sound. Peter Gabriel's So kind of gave everyone the go ahead that this could work in a popular fashion. For people like me who were exploring those sounds, the wonder of if it's going to work or not just went away at that point. English musician Steven Wilson said, People think the 80s were a shallow, superficial era , but he cited So as an album that was really smart . All tracks are written by Peter Gabriel, except where noted. Notes Credits adapted from So's liner notes. The track numbers correspond to the original release. shipments figures based on certification alone",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20%28album%29
"So Amazin' is the third studio album by American singer Christina Milian. The album, her first studio release since 2004's It's About Time, was released by Island Records on April 19, 2006 in Japan, on May 8 in Europe, and on May 16 in the United States. Unlike previous records, which had contributions from many producers, Milian wrote and produced So Amazin' primarily with hip hop producers Cool Dre. During production, Milian was mentored by L.A. Reid and executive producer Jay Z of Def Jam Recordings. The album's musical style is primarily urban and R B, in contrast to the pop sounds of Milian's previous albums, a change suggested by Island Def Jam. Following criticism over her previous albums for a lack of consistency, Milian had ten of the album's tracks produced by Cool Dre. Lyrically, the album was inspired by Milian's breakup with Nick Cannon. So Amazin' was completed within a three month period, and Milian received writing credit for nine of the album's songs. The album debuted and peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard 200, and sold a total of 163,000 copies. Internationally, the album charted in the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland. The album's only single, Say I , featuring rapper Jeezy, saw peak positions of number four in the UK, and number 21 in the United States. The critical response to So Amazin' was mixed. The album's production and Say I were generally praised, while several critics did not feel that the album showcased Milian's personality. Two weeks after the release of So Amazin', Milian was dropped from Island Def Jam Records. Milian's previous release, It's About Time 2004 , was her second studio album, but served as her debut in the US. The critical response to the album was mixed to generally negative. The club tracks, most notably lead single Dip It Low , were praised however, the ballads were said to be disappointing. The album only performed modestly commercially it debuted and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling a total of 382,000 copies, but managed to achieve Silver certification in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R B Album in 2005. Following the album's release, Milian was cast in a lead role in the horror film Pulse, starring alongside Kristen Bell and Ian Somerhalder. Milian traveled to Romania for filming, and later discovered that her then boyfriend Nick Cannon had cheated on her while she was away. Milian said in an interview, it was heartbreaking for me. I was a good girl, a really loyal girl and I got beat real. Whereas Milian's previous albums had pop and R B stylings, she was encouraged by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian said that one of her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R B artist, she wanted to build her core audiencea true fan base that would support her through timeto increase her career's longevity. The main purpose of her genre change was to go back to the streets and add to her core audience. To create a more urban record, Milian had a list of producers that she wanted to work with for So Amazin'. She said that in most cases, even when she had R B producers, most songs would end up being pop instead of R B. L.A. Reid suggested to Milian that she should work with Cool Dre, with whom she ended up working with as the first people to start off the album. Although Milian was originally supposed to work with several different music producers, she felt that the chemistry they had in the first week was so instant and real that she felt she could not get a better vibe with anybody else other than them. Together, they produced four songs in the first few days, which prompted Milian to ask her label if she could continue working with the duo. At the same time, Cool Dre called their managers to ask if they could continue working with Milian. Milian felt that it was just the perfect connection , and that working with them just felt so original . The singer described Cool Dre as beat makers , rather than just hip hop producers, and believed that she was really able to express herself lyrically through their music. Milian ended up working with Cool Dre on the majority of the production of the album, producing ten of the album's eleven tracks together. Milian also wrote the track Y'all Ain't Nothin' with Ne Yo, which was produced by The Heavyweights. Features on the album include Three 6 Mafia, Young Jeezy, and Dre of Cool Dre. While working on the song, Who's Gonna Ride , Dre ran into Three 6 Mafia at the studio and they agreed to feature on the song. The album completed within a three month period, whereas Milian's previous albums would take six months to a year. Milian received writing credit for nine songs on the album. Milian did not try to write mainstream records for the radio rather, she wrote about everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you. For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin', she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like captured emotion . When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, what was going on in her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song. Although Milian was a songwriter since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, there are no rules . Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, where she would have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a no rules theory , which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, It was just, you know what I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records. Milian described So Amazin' as a consistent, very real and personal album . A problem Milian had with her previous album, It's About Time, was that it did not flow. The various pop and urban influences in that album confused the audience, and Milian wanted So Amazin' to paint a picture you get led down the whole way, you kinda get to see my growth through one album . Wanting a more consistent approach for her new album, Milian collaborated with only one team of producers, which made for a greater representation of a more mature, settled Milian. The purpose of the album was to record an album that had more realness, so that female fans could relate to what she was singing about. Milian felt that Cool Dre brought their own style of beats to the album, giving it a raw feel and street credibility . Marcello Cool Valenzano of Cool Dre said that we come from an R B background, and we bringing something new to the table, a style we think is hot. For So Amazin', Milian knew that she needed to record material that had a realness . She wanted to make dance tracks, but also wanted to express more of herself at the same time. Milian found the album to be so much more real and urban and street than her previous albums. The single, Say I , is an inspirational and motivational record Milian wanted to make a record that would be an inspiration to both her and her fans. Focusing on an urban audience, Milian said the record was way more an urban record than anything I've ever done. The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets, and thought his rap was a very real message. It pertained to his life. The track, Twisted , was one of the first songs recorded for the album. Lyrically, the song is about liking someone so much that you can't even go about day in a normal way . Milian compared the urban vibe of both tracks and said they were huge records, where the music is just big and the hook is just big and you cant help but sing . Dre features on two tracks, So Amazing and Hot Boy , which both have a club vibe. Milian thought So Amazing had a similar vibe to several performance records she had done in the past. Milian raps in the track and described it as being really street and sexy . She also said Hot Boy is a hot one for the streets and for the club and for performance. Foolin' was written when Milian heard an old record and sampled the line, if you're foolin, only foolin . Hearing the original track, Milian knew she needed to write something original, and wrote about an ex boyfriend, whom she nicknamed Mr. Big , that was still interested in Milian but had a new girlfriend. The album's final track, She Don't Know , has a Latin vibe and features a Spanish guitar. Being Cuban, Milian wanted to incorporate a Spanish record on the album, and sings in English and Spanish in the song. Taking inspiration from Latin soap operas, Milian wanted to portray a very dramatic feel in the song. Lyrically, the song is about two people falling in love however, the man has a girlfriend who does not know about the new relationship or that he has moved on. Milian wrote So Amazin' based on her own life, and each record pertained to a different aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid tempo track My Lovin' Goes , Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, you see the change in So Amazin' where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now. Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice. Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were Gonna Tell Everybody and Who's Gonna Ride . When Milian and Cool Dre had discussions, her break up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian she was able to get through the break up by writing songs. The production by Cool Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open. Milian wrote the hip hop ballad Gonna Tell Everybody about thinking that I had something good, what happens when it's over, and going forward with my life. The track was one of the final songs that Milian wrote about the break up as it helped me get it all out . While the record is about a break up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs n Harmony song Tha Crossroads and changed the lyrics and I'm gonna miss everybody to and I'm gonna tell everybody . The other song, Who's Gonna Ride , has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons. Milian also said Who's Gonna Ride was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh. So Amazin' debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200, selling 54,000 copies in its first week and 163,000 copies in total. Internationally, the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart, 67 on the UK Albums Chart, and 139 on the France Albums Chart. The album's lead single, Say I , featured rapper Young Jeezy and had a music video, directed by Ray Kay. The single peaked at number four in the UK, and number 21 in the United States. In June 2006, Milian's representative confirmed that she had left Island Def Jam. Although she was dropped from the label, Milian continued to promote the album through live appearances, performing on Power 106's Summer Splash. Milian hoped to take Gonna Tell Everybody , the proposed second single, to another label and shoot a video, but was not able to. Milian revealed in an interview with Rap Up that she was dropped two weeks after the release of her album. Milian stated that before the release of So Amazin', the label and L.A. Reid knew that the album would not have immediate large sales, since she was targeting a new urban audience, but promised to support her. However, after two weeks, L.A. Reid called to notify Milian that she had been dropped. The singer believed that it was a budget cut, and the label opted to spend money on Rihanna instead. Milian also dispelled rumors that she was originally offered Rihanna's song SOS . So Amazin' received mixed reviews from music critics. Metacritic gave the album a Metascorea weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviewsof 59, signifying mixed or average reviews. David Peisner of Maxim gave the album three out of five stars and said that Milian's talent is real , and commended her silky and sassy voice. He praised Cool Dre's badass production, as well as intoxicating lead single Say I . Clover Hope of Billboard wrote that Milian tried to transform from sweet pop sweetheart to peppy urban soulstress , but the album could not pinpoint her true identity and could only the surface of who she really is. Hope praised lead single, Say I , describing it as instantly rousing . Dan Gennoe of Yahoo Music UK said that the production by Cool Dre ensured for a cohesive whole, with a clear, unmistakable identity . He praised single Say I , saying it shimmies to a feisty ghetto strut and Shaft sized orchestrals , as well as Twisted , Hot Boy and Just A Little Bit . He described So Amazin' as almost the perfect R B album , only missing a couple of killer singles . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that while Milian claimed that she was proudly displaying the various sides of her multifaceted personality , he felt that only personality displayed on So Amazin' is that of her contemporaries and predecessors . He felt that contrary to the album's title, So Amazin' proves to be anything but . Andy Kellman, of review website Allmusic, felt that So Amazin' was Milian's strongest album yet, if only by a narrow margin . He said that the album was short on ideas, with Cool Dre using beats from some of their recent hits. He felt that Milian's weakness was ballads, which were more like placeholders that merely apply some forced variety to the album but described the club tracks as perfectly functional and appealing . Spence Dookey of IGN gave the album a 6.9 out of 10 and said that Milian glistens most brightly on the tracks that are the most stripped down, such as 'Gonna Tell Everybody' . He said given the nature of the style of music Milian was practicing, there's a fair share of rump shaking club jams offsetting the more slow tempo fare . Dookey described single Say I as a poundingly theatrical ditty , and Foolin' as one of the few tracks that genuinely attempts to lift Milian up from the generic R B club stylings . The reviewer found the overall sound was the album's biggest flaw the production rings with a sense of detached hollowness ... The result is an album severely lacking any of the warmth that usually accompanies R B. Milian's hauntingly beautiful voice deserves to be wrapped in a sunny glow of organic vibes. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, despite a few lyrical hiccups, a couple of lackluster hooks, and some obvious influences.

"So Appalled is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 2010 . The song was produced by West, along with No I.D. and Mike Dean, and features verses by Jay Z, Cyhi the Prynce, Pusha T, Swizz Beatz, and RZA respectively, who all receive writing credits. Lyrically, the song explores topics such as the troubles produced from being famous, social concerns and features numerous pop culture references. The posse cut received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with West and Jay Z's verses commonly being cited as the highlights. Critics generally praised the production of the song, though the verse given by Cyhi received a mixed reception. Originally released in an unmastered form through West's GOOD Friday initiative, a weekly free music giveaway started by the rapper to promote the album. Following this, So Appalled made its way onto My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with the addition of an extended verse. So Appalled charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under R B Hip Hop Singles singles chart. West performed the song with Jay Z at their Watch the Throne Tour and with Pusha T on his own tour. So Appalled was first released on September 24, 2010, and was the seventh song to be featured on West's GOOD Fridays, a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week. It was originally believed to be a song for West and Jay Z's collaborative album Watch the Throne, but it was later confirmed not to be. The song would later find its way onto West's fifth studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy along with two other GOOD Friday songs. The version on the album was altered production wise and was longer, and featured a sample of Manfred Mann Earth Band's song You Are I Am . The song was released with two covers, one with a famous photo of a model vomiting red nail polish, taken by Guy Bourdin and the other containing the same image, with dimmed lighting and obscured by thick red letters. Before its release the song was leaked online and was nearly scrapped. The majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was recorded in Oahu, Hawaii, a trait that So Appalled shares. Following several media controversies, West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with. Amongst the various artists invited down to Hawaii to record songs for the album was Pusha T, a rapper known for the hip hop duo Clipse. While in Hawaii, Pusha T commented that the very first thing he recorded was his verse for So Appalled . He favorably compared recording with West with another producer he was used to working with, Pharrell Williams, commenting that he enjoyed how the process was more of a canvas. When working with other producers usually a majority of the track was already done by the time he got to the recording studio, but with West, the process was more creative in nature. Pusha described the recording process with West as a roller coast and stated that he never knew what to expect while working with the producer. Upon hearing the production of the song, Pusha T commented that it was so good it persuaded him to write a particularly inspired verse. On the production of So Appalled , he said it's Kanye, the beat brings the ghost out of you. The rapper described his verse as self explanatory and stated that it was one of his favorite of his career. Pusha T called his verse his personal favorite and that the track was originally supposed to be just him and Kanye. When the song was finished, Pusha T was so impressed with the track that he argued with West to include it on his album, stating that the song was so good it didn't matter whether or not it had leaked. He commented I had already raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, there is no way this cant be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. He was like 'Really, you think so ' I was like c'mon man we got to stop treating rap like oh it came out it's dead. When it's good, we have to make people love it and digest it. We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like do what you want to do to any of these, do what you like. One of the producers and guest appearances on the song is RZA, frontman of the hip hop group Wu Tang Clan. RZA spoke positively of West, viewing that he embodied the mentality of the Wu Tang Clan. RZA sent several beats to West, including some that he cited as being edgy, because he felt that West was the type who could work well on more forceful production, including the brooding beat for So Appalled . The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris, a studio album by Diddy. According to another producer on the song, No I.D., it was offered to both Jay Z and Diddy before it leaked. West freestyled over the track for fun and found that he actually liked it enough to ultimately use it himself, stating that it would make a good group song. Cyhi the Prynce's verse only appeared on the song because he tricked West. Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook, but at the time West was tired and let Cyhi record his verse alone. When West awoke and played back the tape, he was surprised to find that Cyhi had recorded an entire verse. Impressed with it, West decided to include it on the track anyway. The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer, who Jay Z references on the line I spent another 30 Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me . So Appalled has been described as an epic posse cut featuring a large roster of performers. West uses his verse to address his past critics and comment on his status as a celebrity. West's performance on the song is notably intense, forcefully rapping lines such as we above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall. Swizz Beatz sets the tone of the song using several ad libs such as one hand in the air, if you don't really care and the line this shit is fucking ridiculous which is repeated several times throughout the song, delivered by nearly every rapper. The second verse is delivered by Jay Z, who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question, would you rather be underpaid or overrated Jay Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing. The song contains numerous pop culture references, like to the film The Dark Knight, the breakfast cereal Cheerios, the business figure and future United States President, Donald Trump, rapper M.C. Hammer and We Major , a song from West's album Late Registration. On the unconventional structure of the song, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman said that verses were very lengthy Kanye appears within the first minute and then drops out for good but the droning beat is so mesmerizing that it's barely even noticeable. Andy Gill of The Independent explained the use of several guest appearances, writing Kanye has never been short on ambition or ego, so it's no surprise he should have his guests including such hip hop luminaries as Jay Z, Swizz Beats and RZA queue up on So Appalled to confirm in turn how 'this shit is fucking ridiculous' . So Appalled received mostly favorable reviews from contemporary critics. David Browne of Time wrote that he felt that the track was built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings and that it sounded as if West was marching into the apocalypse. David Amidon of PopMatters compared the production to West's album Late Registration which found West inviting his friend Jon Brion to impart slices of film scoring to the odds and ends of his tracks . He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the song contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront , concluding that tracks Hell of a Life and So Appalled alone carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool's errand. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV praised the song, reporting this all star cipher is a backpackers dream as Ye's GOOD Music soldiers fire away with resolve. But the Brooklyn icon, Jay Z, steals the show with an edgy verse dismissing his critics with a 16 that's as pushy as a New Yorker during rush hour. Please, Hammer, stop replying. Slant Magazine's Cole Mathews thought that the song returned West to his hard rap origins, commenting with the posse cuts 'Monster' and 'So Appalled', Kanye kicks out the two hardest rap tracks of his career. Becky Bain of Idolater described the song as a dramatic, gloomy epic of a tune that has each artist taking turns at the mic. He expressed that trying to find Kanye's verse was virtually a musical Where's Waldo . It was noted for its impressive roster of features and was described as another Kanye West helmed all star collabo by MTV's Hawuse Ziegbe. He noted that Cyhi managed to hold his own against several much more regarded rappers. Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes described the song as a super sized cypher, stating that the track was packed with plenty of shitalking from the group of rappers. Pitchfork's Tom Breihan criticized Cyhi's lyrical contributions to the song, stating On the otherwise amazing Kanye track 'So Appalled', CyHi offers a black hole of a verse. His most memorable line 'If God had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist' mostly just raises questions. Like Why does God's iPod only have one playlist IGN's Chad Grischow described the song as a star studded banger, and cited Jay Z's verse as the most notable. In addition, Grischow stated that the song was unfocused. Chris Martins of Spin reported that much like the track Monster , the guest appearances on the song had the potential to be toned down. Chicago Sun Times writer Thomas Conner cited the line praise due to the most high, Allah Praise due to the most fly, Prada as an example of genius songwriting on West's part. The song charted at 14 on the Bubbling Under R B Hip Hop Singles chart as reported by Billboard, however it only spent one week on the chart. The song also appeared on the South Korean Gaon Chart at number 95. M.C. Hammer promised to release a track on October 31, 2010 in response to Jay Z's So Appalled lyrics which he felt attacked him. Jay Z raps a verse targeting Hammer about his financial dilemma in the 1990s. Within it Jay says 'Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused I lost 30 mil' so I spent another 30 'Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me'. Hammer addressed his displeasure about the diss on Twitter, claiming he would react to Jay Z on Halloween. Hammer released a sample of his beef with Jay Z a.k.a. 'Hell Boy' according to Hammer in a brief teaser trailer called Better Run Run by 'King Hammer'. At one point, it was uncertain if his reaction would be a film video, a music video or a combination of both. Regardless, he claimed he would show evidence that 'Jigga worships the devil'. It's possible that Jay Z was offended by an analogy Hammer was conveying in an earlier interview in response to D.O.A. Death of Auto Tune on AllHipHop. On November 1, Hammer's song and video titled Better Run Run hit the web in retaliation to Jay Z's September 2010 diss towards him. M.C. accuses Jigga of being in league and in the studio with Satan and then Hammer defeats the devil and forces Jay to be baptized. Speaking on the video, Jacob O'Gara of Ethos Magazine wrote What's more likely is that this feud is the last chapter in the tragic cautionary tale of M.C. Hammer, a tale that serves as a warning to all present and future kings of hip hop. Keep your balance on the pedestal and wear the crown strong or you'll have the Devil to pay. In an interview with BBC's DJ Semtex, Jay said he didn't mean the verses as a personal attack. I didn't know that Hammer's financial status wasn't on the table for discussion he said. I didn't know I was the first person ever to say that... He continued, When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out that's wasn't a cheap plug, he laughed. He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn't know I said anything wrong The track was nightly performed by West and Jay Z during their Watch the Throne Tour. Pusha T performs the song live during his own live sets. The song was one of the few songs on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy not to be featured on Runaway, a 35 minute music video directed by West set to music from the album.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20Appalled
"So Beautiful or So What is the twelfth solo studio album by American folk rock singer songwriter Paul Simon. It was released on April 8, 2011, by Hear Music. The album found Simon reuniting with former collaborator and record producer Phil Ramone. Having experimented with rhythm based textures for much of the previous two decades, the singer returned to composing songs in a more traditional manner using only his acoustic guitar. These songs were further augmented by experimental recording practices in the studio. The album was largely recorded in a small cottage at Simon's home in New Canaan, Connecticut. The music of So Beautiful or So What features West African blues inspired guitar playing, Indian style percussion, and experimentation with samples, which ranged from an excerpt from a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya. The songs were recorded with little bass but with a very large presence of bells. Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album. So Beautiful or So What received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it Simon's best work in two decades. It later appeared on many year end lists of the year's best records. The album also became his highest US chart debut, reaching number four on the Billbooard 200, and charted within the top ten in nine other countries. For So Beautiful or So What, Simon reunited with record producer and former collaborator Phil Ramone, who previously worked with him on Simon Garfunkel's 1982 live album The Concert in Central Park. According to Simon, the reunion came casually he told Ramone when they met each other that he was beginning to work on a new album and, as Ramone lived in the next town, they decided it would be easy to work together again. Simon recorded the album at his small cottage in New Canaan, Connecticut. The recording sessions often consisted solely of Simon, Ramone, and engineer Andy Smith. Throughout the production of the record, the albums engineers would gradually make upgrades to the space during months off. As it was not acoustically designed or soundproofed, Smith often employed iZotope RX software to rid the recordings of extra noise, such as an oak tree above the home from which acorns fell, interrupting recordings. Keeping in line with his experimental attitude, Simon decided to record the acorns, remarking, All sounds are musical once you start to listen. Occasionally, Simon would record in the control room instead. Like all of Simons output from his 1997 effort Songs from The Capeman onward, the album was recorded digitally using Pro Tools. Much time was spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of experimentation among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand built cigar box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc each evening of the days session, and he would return the next day with notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than at the end of the process. Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes. The album's production lasted over a year. Additional recording took place at Simons summer home in Montauk, New York on Long Island, but less so than his previous efforts. Home recording, as Ramone told Sound on Sound shortly after the albums release, required a certain discipline. Simon would often arrive in the morning and recording until nightfall. Percussion and vocals were overdubbed at Germano Studios. The Indian ensemble on Dazzling Blue was recorded at Clinton Studios in New York City, while a bluegrass ensemble was cut at Tony Bennetts New Jersey studio. Simons wife, Edie Brickell, and his teenage daughter Lulu contributed harmonies, while Chris Bear of indie rock band Grizzly Bear contributed electronic drum parts to the album. Simon financed the recording of So Beautiful or So What himself after being released from his 30 year record contract with Warner Bros. Records. After the recording sessions were finished, he signed a deal with Concord Music Group to distribute the album. Simon said, It's the best work I've done in 20 years. The cover art, titled DNA Mutation , was designed by visual artist and NASA systems engineer Sven Geier. So Beautiful or So What finds Simon returning to more harmonic based compositions than rhythm based. This was spurred from when he realized his favorite song on his 2006 effort Surprise, Everything About It Is a Love Song , contained a chord progression he found particularly interesting. After coming to this realization, he focused on the albums three ballads, Questions for the Angels , Amulet , and Love and Hard Times . Unlike his previous rhythm based albums, in which he would gain inspiration for his guitar parts from pre recorded backing tracks, Simon took a more traditional approach to building the songs on So Beautiful or So What. He wrote songs at home before developing them further in the studio with the help of a natural click track, such as a percussion instrument, or even just tapping out a rhythm on his guitar. He overdubbed additional elements afterwards, including additional guitar parts and percussion. Simon began envisioning the albums sequencing when he only had a few songs written, letting it inform his songwriting. The music for So Beautiful or So What was inspired by West African blues, which Simon combined with Indian drumming, Old Hollywood strings and bluegrass harmony singing. The songs employ a wide variety of samples, including from older blues and gospel recordings. Love Is Eternal Sacred Light contains a harmonica sample from Sonny Terry, and Love and Blessings lifts from The Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet. Simon did not want to record an ordinary studio album and instead, according to Ramone, wanted lots of space with lots of atmosphere and feeling ... Rather than go for hugely orchestrated ideas he was going, for example, for overtones in bells and gongs. Or if a sax or a kora comes in, they're there to do something specific, and not to fill in the space. The album's music is also largely devoid of heavy bass some tracks actually using a baritone guitar instead , and drums are very quiet and reserved. Smith said percussion instruments, including exotic bells, ancient hand bells, and glockenspiels, were Simon's favorite to record with for the album. In using bells to augment the sound, Simon put them behind certain guitar notes to highlight the sound, as he wanted the recordings to be devoid of echo he found that using bells created only a slight echo, with an odd, atmospheric tone that he preferred. Drummer Jim Oblon placed towels over each drums to emphasize the higher frequency percussive instruments. Paul Simon The songs on So Beautiful or So What touch on subjects such as love, mortality, and faith. In terms of songwriting, Simon did not approach each new song with a theme instead, he let them evolve naturally from the first line he would compose. Simon had no plans to pursue religious writing, but it ended up particularly strong in the albums lyrics. He noted that five of the first six songs he wrote touched on themes of God I wondered whether there was a subconscious theme that I was tapping into. I have used Christian symbols and imagery before in songs. Its very strongly evocative, so it may just be coincidencebut it may not be. The A.V. Club suggested that the album's gospel influence inspired the touch of humor when discussing dark subjects such as death. Getting Ready for Christmas Day was one of the albums earliest completed songs, and it contains a sample from a 1941 sermon by the Reverend J.M. Gates. The sermon inspired the songs creation, with a certain rhythmic tone to his oration that interested him. Simon heard the sermon on a box set titled Goodbye Babylon, which consists early 20th century Americana. It came together quicker than other songs, with Simon recording his guitar live. The track also references his nephew, who served multiple tours in the Iraq War. The Afterlife concerns a man dying and getting to heaven, where he waits in line to meet with God, where everyone is filling out forms and waiting in line to catch 'a glimpse of the divine.' While in line, he unsuccessfully hits on a woman. When he finally meets God, he is taken aback, and can only spout gibberish. The point of the song is that having questions for God would cease to be relevant if one were to confront God face to face due the enormity of such a theoretical situation. Dazzling Blue is based on his relationship with wife Edie Brickell, and the title references her favorite color. The CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing , sang Simon over African cadences and Indian tablas, before marvelling at how his wife and he were born beneath a star of dazzling blue . He said the song reminded him of his work as a part of Simon Garfunkel. Rewrite features segments of recordings made on a small digital recorder by Brickell on a 2009 family trip together in Kenya. Simon was frustrated over the guitar tone in his song and attached the sound of a wildebeest to a certain guitar note each time it occurred, in an effort to create an interesting sound. The song contains nighttime ambience recorded during the trip. It was written about a burned out Vietnam veteran imagining that he could rewrite his life, in order to give it a happy ending. Love and Hard Times is an affirmation of love for Brickell. The beginning of the song references God and his only son visiting Earth. Simon noted that the songs thesis is being thankful at the highest level. The track contains orchestral arrangement from Gil Goldstein, which was recorded at Avatar Studios, as Ramone wanted a larger room to record in. Questions for the Angels includes a reference to American rapper Jay Z, which was inspired by a billboard featuring him that was present over the Brooklyn Bridge for a time. Simon mentioned that he would pass it on his way to the Brooklyn Academy of Music when they were holding a month long celebration of his music in April 2008. Simon included the line to create a sharp transition from angels in Heaven to a downtown Brooklyn street. So Beautiful or So What contains what Simon once admitted is one of favorite Bo Diddley rhythms, and the songs title references Miles Davis's So What . The title is a question Simon envisioned when facing the enormity of the infinite. The song almost became a collaboration with Bob Dylan Simon felt two verses might be nice for him and sent him a message through their mutual manager. Although Dylan said that he liked the song, Simon did not hear back in sufficient time, as the album was on a deadline. Many songs from So Beautiful or So What were made available in various forms before their release on the album. Rewrite and Love and Hard Times appeared in Simon's 2008 book Lyrics 1964 2008, Questions for the Angels was included on the 2009 Starbucks compilation This Better Be Good, and the lead single Getting Ready for Christmas Day premiered on National Public Radio on November 16, 2010. On April 5, 2011, So Beautiful or So What was available for streaming on the album's website of the same name for the week preceding its official release. It was released on formats including digital download, vinyl LP, and a CD deluxe edition with a DVD featuring footage of Simon's live performances at Webster Hall. Rolling Stone held a sweepstakes for fans to win a collector's edition box set, which was released in a limited amount of 1,000 copies and included the CD DVD deluxe edition, a vinyl copy, and a 12' x 12' lithograph and replica notebook. In the first week of the album's release, it debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and sold 68,000 copies in the United States. It was Simon's highest chart debut on the chart, and by October 2011, it had sold 254,000 copies in the US. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number six on the British albums chart, selling 21,993 copies in its first week. It was Simon's ninth top ten solo album in the UK. In April 2016, the album reached sales of 319,000 copies in the US. So Beautiful or So What was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 27 reviews. Many critics compared its diverse influences to the music of Simon's 1986 album Graceland. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said So Beautiful or So What sounded not only focused but vivid, vibrant, and current in a way none of Simon's peers have managed to achieve . Los Angeles Times writer Margaret Wappler praised its multiethnic landscape of American folk and Afropop influences on an album that is his best since 1990's Rhythm of the Saints. In The New York Times, Jon Pareles took note of Simon's lyrics Sketches of individuals and moments are intertwined with grander pronouncements unforced humor tempers gloomier reflections . Will Hodgkinson from The Times believed his meditations on the afterlife are informed by both youthful enthusiasm and the wisdom of old age, while The Guardian's Maddy Costa said Simon finds an answer to the ineffable in song . Many reviewers took note of the rather overt religious symbolism in Simon's lyrics one Irish blogger facetiously called So Beautiful or So What the year's best Christian music album, while American evangelical journalist Cathleen Falsani said it was the most significant record of spiritually reflective music in recent years. Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found Simon's usual folk rock graced with global colors that sound as natural as his guitar and said his lyrics are imbued with gratitude for his wife's love and God, although he disagreed with Simon's view of God's benevolent nature. Some critics were less receptive. Pitchfork reviewer Stephen M. Deusner said the record can be stodgy in its emotions and a bit too devoted to its motifs , and Simon too preoccupied with the 20th century , although his down to earth lyrical allusions helped rescue the album from the solemn, end of life affairs of other albums by older musicians. Andy Gill from The Independent was more critical, finding much of Simon's ruminations on love, age, and mortality trivial. He named Love Is Eternal Sacred Light as a highlight but still felt its evocation of the singer's 1987 song The Boy in the Bubble made it seem predictable coming from Simon. At the end of 2011, So Beautiful or So What appeared on several top ten lists curated by music publications. Rolling Stone named it the year's 3rd best record, while Mojo ranked it 15th. It was voted the 14th best album of the year in The Village Voice's Pazz Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 3rd on his year end list for The Barnes Noble Review. Years later, he said So Beautiful or So What and Simon's 2016 album Stranger to Stranger had remained the singer's 21st century prizes . All songs written by Paul Simon.

"So Close is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz for the musical fantasy film Enchanted 2007 , recorded by American singer Jon McLaughlin. In the film, the song is performed by McLaughlin as himself, a band vocalist, musically accompanying main characters Giselle and Robert as they dance together at a costume ball. The song's lyrics describe both their relationship with each other, as well as Giselle's journey and growth as a character. Enchanted's songs become more contemporary in style as Giselle matures into a modern day young woman, with So Close resembling the style of music featured in Disney films during the 1990s, a theme similarly reflected by the character's choice of wardrobe during the scene. A romantic pop ballad, Menken and Schwartz based So Close on the title song from Disney's Beauty and the Beast 1991 , a song Menken himself had written the music for, while its cinematography was designed to invoke the camera movement in Beauty and the Beast's famous ballroom sequence. The track was arranged and produced by Robbie Buchanan, who had previously arranged pop versions of the theme songs from Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin 1992 and Pocahontas 1995 . The song has received generally negative reviews from film and music critics, who were unimpressed with its slow tempo. So Close was one of three songs from Enchanted nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards. McLaughlin's live performance during the telecast was met with critical acclaim, and is credited with introducing the singer to a wider audience while bolstering sales of his own material. So Close was written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. Menken and Schwartz based So Close on the title song from Beauty and the Beast 1991 , a song Menken himself had written the music for. In addition to conceiving the song's title, director Kevin Lima specifically asked that the song's final lyrics be So close and still so far to mirror the idea that this appears to be Enchanted's main characters Giselle and Robert's final moment together. The songwriters enlisted Robbie Buchanan to produce the track Buchanan had previously arranged and produced the single version of Beauty and the Beast , as well as A Whole New World and Colors of the Wind from Aladdin 1992 and Pocahontas 1995 , respectively. Menken recorded an early demo version of the song before it was forwarded to Buchanan, who created its backing track. In addition to Buchanan, many musicians contributed to the track before it was finally returned to the producer, and then Menken. Menken proceeded to use Buchanan's track to orchestrate the song while developing an instrumental middle section during which the characters would dance. Menken and Schwartz co produced. Although arranger Danny Troob contributed some orchestration to the song, he attributes the majority of its arrangement to Buchanan. So Close was recorded by singer songwriter Jon McLaughlin, who was recruited from his record label by the film's music supervisor after Menken and Schwartz began searching for a suitable singer. Instrumentalists on the track include bassist Neil Stubenhaus, drummer John Robinson and guitarist Michael Landau, while Buchanan himself contributed both piano and synthesizer. Menken had written an alternative version of So Close , which the filmmakers enjoyed but ultimately rejected in favor of the final version used in the film. Additionally, a song originally written for the villain Queen Narissa Susan Sarandon was eliminated from the film because Lima felt that the musical number would occur too close to So Close , wanting to prevent the film from becoming a full out musical. The song was released on November 20, 2007 as part of the film's soundtrack. Stylistically, the songs in Enchanted progress and become more modern over the course of the film, with Amy Adams describing So Close as a lot more poppy than previous songs Happy Working Song and That's How You Know . Schwartz explained that the score grows increasingly modern as Giselle develops into a contemporary young woman , likening So Close to the 1990s era of Disney musicals, such as Beauty and the Beast and Pocahontas. The decision to have the song performed by an outer voice as opposed to a main character was derived from the reality of this particular moment in the film, and the songwriters agreed that it would be more appropriate to have somebody sing it right in that ball. Troob observed that, although the actors pretend that the song is being performed by a professional singer, the track is a pop record with a pop orchestra playing behind it. Patrick Dempsey initially protested the idea of singing a small portion of the song, but Schwartz insisted. The sequence was deliberately choreographed to reference the camera movement and angles used in the famous ballroom sequence from Beauty and the Beast, as Lima had envisioned replicating the scene in live action. Adams and Dempsey attended several dance classes together prior to filming the scene. Despite already having experience as a solo dancer, Adams found the process unusual as she was required to break down some of my own barriers in order to learn how to dance with a partner for the first time. She was initially reluctant to allow Dempsey to lead, describing herself as stubborn and suffering the loss of a few toenails in the process. Adams found it difficult to adjust until a professional ballroom dancer reviewed their progress and advised her to surrender to Dempsey, reminding her that you are dancing your own dance even though you are being led . The actors rehearsed several times before they finally trusted each other. Adams received this as an important life lesson that can be applied to real life relationships and situations working with Patrick ... was really important ... I had to learn to trust him fully to lead me backwards through a crowd of people and I think really helped us form communication and trust on set, because we were forced to tell each other what we really needed. Giselle's transition from a fairy tale character into a real woman is exemplified by her wardrobe choices. The purple gown Adams wears during the ball sequence was designed by costume designer Mona May, who drew inspiration from costumes used in 1930s musical films, specifically gowns worn by actress Ginger Rogers, as well as several concept drawings of early Disney Princesses. However, the costume designer also wanted the dress to resemble an outfit purchased from Bergdorf Goodman, explaining, its so important to be slick and modern, to be not fairy tale anymore, because weve seen the fairy tale ... Shes now a modern girl. Shes deciding to stay here to really understand this world, to know her feelings and who she is , an idea she believes is supported by the gown's silhouette and color. May described Giselle's final look as completely modern , devoid pouf and curls in her hair. Identifying Giselle as one of Disney's first princesses to save the prince , May also wanted her gown to demonstrate the character's feminine strength . Although Giselle is shown undergoing a makeover during a shopping montage, the filmmakers avoided showing Giselle trying on different outfits to ensure that her final selection remains a surprise. Adams helped design the glass slippers her character wears during the scene, which were custom made to allow her to dance. Meanwhile, Roberts' outfit pays homage to the Beast's tuxedo in Beauty and the Beast. Executive producer Chris Chase decided to set the scene in the Woolworth Building, a skyscraper in Manhattan, because he believes that the building is such a medieval looking castle , containing gargoyles in addition to being very decorated. He described it as a modern day reflection of a castle , thus adhering to the film's theme of both reflecting and contrasting traditional fairy tales. The sequence is preceded by a shopping montage, in which Giselle Adams is treated to a shopping spree by Robert's daughter Morgan Rachel Covey to update her wardrobe in preparation for The King Queen's Ball. The dress Giselle ultimately wears is meant to signify her transformation into a contemporary New Yorker , as opposed to a more opulent outfit. Giselle and her betrothed, Prince Edward James Marsden , arrive at The Kings Queens Ball, a costume ball where they meet Robert Dempsey and his fiance Nancy Idina Menzel . For The King and Queen's Waltz , the conductor invites all gentlemen to ask a lady with whom they did not attend the ball dance. Edward immediately invites Nancy to dance and, after a moment of hesitation, Robert asks Giselle to do the same, allowing the two to finalize bond with each other. In the film, McLaughlin plays himself and performs So Close diegetically as a band vocalist, accompanied by an orchestra. The song offers an outer voice that mirrors Giselle's inner emotional journey. While Giselle and Robert dance, the other couples vacate the center of the ballroom floor, allowing them more room. Robert quietly sings a few of the song's lines to Giselle. The couples dance in quadruple meter. Nancy eventually interrupts them, reuniting with Robert as Edward prepares to leave the ball and New York with Giselle. While Edward retrieves Giselle's wrap, she gazes at Robert completing their dance with Nancy as the song concludes. Menken described So Close as a heartfelt, emotional moment in the film. According to the song's official sheet music published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, So Close was written in the key of E major, performed slowly in common time. The track lasts a duration of three minutes and forty nine seconds. According to The Musical Theater of Stephen Schwartz From Godspell to Wicked author Paul R. Laird, the song is performed in 4 4 time with a prevailing triplet motion , thus the ballad is not a waltz since it is not written in 3 4 time. Filmtracks.com identified the song as a modern ... contemporary pop ballad. Musically, So Close resembles Menken's era of Disney songwriting , with the composer himself describing the track as a more contemporary, adult ballad and agreeing that the song is really in my ballad style . Troob described So Close as a very straight ahead pop ballad reminiscent of music popular during the 1980s and 1990s. Peter Knegt of IndieWire described the ballad as mid 1990s slow dance sounding . In addition to being a pop song, the track employs heavy pop orchestration instruments such as bass, drums, guitar, piano and synthesizer can be heard throughout the piece. Laird described Menken's composition as a flowing tune with a wide range that takes McLaughlin's tenor to a d flat , which he performs in falsetto. Performing the track using a melancholic voice , McLaughlin's vocal range on the song spans three octaves, from B3 Db6. So Close is a love song. The song features lyrics that mirror the film and Giselle's relationship with Robert, beginning with You're in my arms And all the word is gone The music playing on for only two so close together and ending ...So close, and still So far... to indicate that there is still separation between the two, despite how close they've grown. This last line refers to the characters' close physical proximity to each other but different fates. Laird observed that, in addition to conveying the song's dual message, Schwartz is less reliant on rhyming words, but nonetheless uses lyrics such as happy end instead of happy ending in order to rhyme with pretend . The ballad's lyrics also consist of puns. Critical reception towards So Close has been generally negative. Filmtracks.com described the song as stale . The Houston Chronicle's Amy Biancolli criticized its slow tempo, writing that musical nitpickers ... might wish that climactic ballroom 'waltz' had actually been in three four time. Golderby writer Andrew Carden dismissed So Close as a real snooze. Jared Johnson, writing for The Sojourn, conversely described the track as a beautiful love ballad . So Close was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008, in addition to Happy Working Song and That's How You Know from Enchanted. So Close was the only nominated song from Enchanted not performed by Adams. The three songs had collectively sold 177,000 digital downloads prior to the awards ceremony. Although Peter Knegt of IndieWire enjoyed Enchanted's songs, he felt that So Close was undeserving of a nomination. Billboard polled its readers, asking them which of the five nominees they hoped would win Best Original Song, 10 of whom voted for So Close . So Close is ranked as McLaughlin's most streamed song on Spotify, having accumulated more than 16 million streams as of January 2019. McLaughlin performed So Close live at the 80th Academy Awards, where the song had been nominated for Best Original Song. The performance was introduced by Dempsey, while dancers dressed as the film's main characters recreated the ballroom scene on stage. McLaughlin's performance earned critical acclaim, and is credited with establishing him as an overnight sensation while introducing his music to a wider audience. Following McLaughlin's performance, Amanda Valentovic of Bandsintown deemed the song a classic . McLaughlin's debut studio album Indiana experienced a 1,514 increase in sales on Amazon overnight, resulting in the album peaking at number one on its Movers Shakers chart. AllMusic biographer Marisa Brown wrote that the singer's public profile received an extra boost following the ceremony, claiming that McLaughlin used the resulting momentum to drum up support for his third studio album, OK Now. Charlee Vaughan and Jared Johnson, both critics for The Sojourn, lamented the fact that the singer excluded the song from his 2012 and 2013 performances at the Phillippe Performing Arts Center, which Vaughan found unusual considering its popularity. Singer John Barrowman and actress Jodie Prenger covered the song as a duet for the former's 2010 eponymous studio album. Barrowman had met Prenger when she auditioned for the British talent competition I'd Do Anything in 2008, and asked her to record So Close with him in September 2009, to which she immediately agreed. Prenger was the first artist Barrowman considered for the duet. Adrian Edwards of BBC wrote that their rendition failed to leave any lasting impression.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20Close%20%28Enchanted%20song%29
"So Excited is a song recorded by American singer songwriter Janet Jackson featuring guest vocals from rapper Khia. It was released in August 2006 on Virgin Records as the second single from Jackson's ninth studio album, 20 Y.O.. The song was written by Jackson, Jermaine Dupri, James Phillips, Johnta Austin, James Harris III, Terry Lewis and Khia Chambers, with Herbie Hancock, Michael Beinhorn and Bill Laswell also receiving songwriting credits for sampling Hancock's 1983 song Rockit . Production for So Excited was handled by Dupri, LRoc, Jam, Lewis and Jackson. So Excited is musically a hip hop and dance song which lyrically expresses submission from a woman to her lover. It received mixed reviews from music critics, with some considering the song the highlight from 20 Y.O. while others found it disappointing. So Excited performed poorly on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 90, but managed to become Jackson's seventeenth number one dance hit in the country. It also was successful in Europe, reaching the top ten and the top thirty in selected regions. The music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn. It depicts Jackson's clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine. After Khia was given a diminished role in the music video, she criticized Jackson online. Jackson performed the song on Today, the 2006 Billboard Music Awards, and the 2008 Rock Witchu Tour. In 2005, Jackson started working on her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., with her then partner, record producer Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned as the executive producer. The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was feeling at the time her third studio album Control 1986 was recorded. I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20 ' I was so intrigued with what was going on in her life then that I just thought her album should be called that , Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R B sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled So Excited . However producer Dupri said she would be not rapping on the track, Khia's on the record because I'm a producer and I heard a sound that I wanted. She don't actually rap on the record, I'm giving you the exclusive. Its something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish to be out here talking . I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing . So Excited was written by Jackson, Jermaine Dupri, James Phillips, Johnta Austin, James Harris III, Terry Lewis and Khia Chambers and was produced by Dupri, LRoc, Jam, Lewis and Jackson. The song is a hip hop and dance track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock's 1983 song Rockit , with Hancock, Michael Beinhorn and Bill Laswell also receiving writing credits. In So Excited , Jackson promises submission for her lover, singing, I'll open my spot for you Anytime you want me to . So Excited received mixed reviews from music critics. Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine criticized 20 Y.O., but enjoyed the track, calling it a sticky ear candy song. He further commented that the sexed up number carries a throwaway contribution from Khia to, if not ultimate satisfaction, at least a half decent orgasm . Miles Marshall Lewis from The Village Voice was also positive, saying that Dupri girds 'So Excited' with 'Rockit' scratches, coaching guest rapper Khia to sound like Da Brat on the naughty hook. Serviceable enough, it's surprisingly the highlight of the album. Spence D. from IGN felt that So Excited was like a glorious slice of radio ready '80s churban soul wrapped up and delivered for a current audience. Glenn Gamboa, writer for Newsday, commented that So Excited was a good indicator of what to expect from the current incarnation of Jackson. It's streetwise, lighthearted and easily digestible . Sasha Frere Jones, writer from The New Yorker was enthusiastic with the song, calling it a loud dance tune that is reminiscent of the songs on Control , although she criticized some lyrics. For Don Baiocchi from Blogcritics, the song was not the flawless dance floor anthem her fans were hoping for. Chuck Taylor from Billboard called it disappointing, and felt it was bland and lacked innovation. Similarly, Evan Serpick, writing for Rolling Stone, stated, Almost all of the tunes here particularly 'So Excited' try to replicate Jackson's early work, with diminishing returns . So Excited debuted at its peak of number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100, on the issue dated October 5, 2006. It debuted on the Hot R B Hip Hop Songs at number 75, eventually peaking at number 34, becoming her 39th top forty single on the chart. Nevertheless, on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, So Excited became Jackson's 22nd consecutive top ten single and her 17th number one hit on the chart. It was well received in Europe. The song debuted at its peak of number 14 in Belgium's Flanders region. In Wallonia, it reached number five. In Finland, So Excited debuted at its peak of number nine, remaining in the chart for two issues. In Italy, it reached number 28, while peaking at number 13 in Spain. The accompanying music video for So Excited was directed by Joseph Kahn, with choreography done by Gil Duldulao it premiered on September 13, 2006 on BET's Access Granted. A group called X1FX handled VFX visual effects for the video. In the video, Jackson's clothes disappear through a complex dance routine with her female dancers. Also, occasional skeleton people appear in an X ray effect, and on the 2 minute mark, Jackson is seen inside a yellow sports car eating a strawberry. The video received positive reviews from critics, who considered it a departure from the video for her previous single, but some scenes were criticized. They were also surprised with Jackson naked in the video, after her Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004. After Khia was given a diminished role in the music video, she went to her MySpace account to say she was not pleased with her scenes being displayed in a TV during the music video, and criticized Jackson. Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, I don't say anything that I don't mean. I meant every word that I said. People mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but she called me and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans . On September 9, 2006, Jackson went to France to perform So Excited at NRJ's Back to School concert, along with past single Nasty . While on The Oprah Winfrey Show, she was interviewed and performed both tracks again, with this being the first time a performance of So Excited was broadcast on television. The show aired on September 25. On December 4, 2006, Jackson opened the 2006 Billboard Music Awards with a medley of past song The Pleasure Principle and So Excited , with Control serving as an introduction to the number. She was accompanied by white, black and red clad dancers. The song was included on the setlist for the Rock Witchu Tour in 2008. She was dressed in a gold and black glam hip hop inspired track suit, and one gold glove. It was used as an interlude on the Unbreakable World Tour in 20152016. So Excited was also used as a part of the DJ Intermission for Jacksons State of the World Tour in 2017 and was performed live on the final date of the first leg of the tour. Jackson also included the song on her 2019 Las Vegas Residency Janet Jackson Metamorphosis.

"So Far, So Good... So What is the third studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on January 19, 1988 by Capitol Records. It was the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, both of whom were fired from the band in early 1989, several months after the completion of the album's world tour. So Far, So Good... So What features music performed at fast tempos with technical ability lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech. So Far, So Good... So What was well received by critics upon its release, although retrospective analysis has been less favorable. It managed to enter the top thirty of the Billboard 200 although it received no commercial radio play , and charted in several other countries as well. The album was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA, and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene. Guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson had been both fired from the band following the conclusion of the Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing. Work on the album started while Reynolds was in the band, but continued after the induction of Young. To mix the album, the label turned to Paul Lani, who had remixed the band's previous album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying . Mustaine was initially skeptical, but later became very irate with Lani's eccentricities and his way of handling things. To mix the album, Lani relocated himself and Mustaine to Bearsville Studios, near Woodstock, New York, ostensibly for the purpose of inspiration. Mustaine decided that he had his limits when he, having just awakened and made coffee, noticed Lani outside in his underwear feeding an apple to a deer. Mustaine flew back to Los Angeles later that day and fired Lani, who was replaced by Michael Wagener. Mustaine has since criticized Wagener's pedestrian mixing efforts, citing the album's muddy feel , in particular. Mustaine was able to recruit Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones to perform guitar parts on Anarchy in the U.K. According to music critic J. D. Considine of Spin, So Far, So Good... So What displays music performed at volumes approaching the threshold of pain . This was the first album where another band member other than Mustaine contributed to writing, with bassist David Ellefson contributing to either lyrics or music on half of the album's songs. The album features fast guitar solos, multiple tempo changes and technical dexterity. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic observed that the album offers the classic take no prisoners style which is commonly associated with Megadeth however, he noted that the sound does not differ much from the other underground metal bands from that period. Jim Farber of Rolling Stone called Mustaine's vocals bloodthirsty and praised the musicianship for keeping rhythmic pace even at the most anarchic moments . Los Angeles Times journalist Dennis Hunt noted that the music was filled with extensive and torrid instrumentals and described Mustaine's singing as a combination of extreme shrieking and screaming. Despite the positive overview, Anarchy in the U.K. received some negative criticism, partially because it was perceived to lack the rebelliousness of the original version. The lyrical themes on the album explore a variety of subjects, from nuclear holocaust Set the World Afire to revisionism and censorship Hook in Mouth . Still, the majority of the songs are accompanied by the same sentiment of disillusion and nihilism as their previous two albums. Unlike traditional topics related to heavy metal music, the song In My Darkest Hour contains emotional lyrics which deal with loneliness and isolation. Dave Mustaine revealed that he tried to write about subject matters that were in touch with reality, including social issues and taboo topics. The lyrics on Megadeth's cover of Anarchy in the U.K. were slightly mistaken because Mustaine claimed he had heard them incorrectly. The album's first track, Into the Lungs of Hell , is an instrumental composition which features synthesized horns, winds and percussion. Set the World Afire is the first song Dave Mustaine wrote for Megadeth after being fired from Metallica. He was a member of Metallica from 1981 to 1983, and was dismissed just before Metallica recorded its debut album Kill 'Em All. He later said that he wrote the lyrics during his journey home from the departure. Inspiration for the song came from a newspaper he read while on the bus back to California. The initial lyrics were written with a borrowed pencil on a cupcake wrapper, leading some fans to refer to Set the World Afire as the cupcake song . The beginning of the song contains a sample of I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire , a 1941 song by The Ink Spots. Anarchy in the U.K. is a Sex Pistols cover, which quickly became a staple of the band's live set. Over the years, the song was dropped from the set list because of its anti Christian viewpoint. Mary Jane tells a story about a young witch buried alive by her father near the Loon Lake cemetery in Minnesota. According to the legend, anyone who dared to disturb her grave was doomed to a prompt death. The song features descending guitar lines and begins with Mustaine summoning her spirit during the introduction. 502 is about breaking laws and driving fast cars. The title is a reference to the police code in California for drunk driving. In My Darkest Hour was written by Mustaine shortly after the death of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Mustaine had found out through word of mouth, as his former bandmates never contacted him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe. He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. Liar is a diss song directed at past member Chris Poland, who Mustaine claimed was stealing guitars and selling them for heroin money. Hook in Mouth declaims censorship and the Parents Music Resource Center PMRC . Mustaine elaborated that the lyrics were aimed at those who were fucking around with our constitutional rights and trying to take away our freedom of speech . The album received positive feedback from music critics at the time of its release. In a contemporary review, Holger Stratmann from Rock Hard hailed the album as the new masterpiece of Megadeth and asserted that the band had created a great follow up to their highly acclaimed Peace Sells... but Who's Buying Jim Farber of Rolling Stone also gave the album a favorable review, saying it propelled the group right at the top of the thrash rock heap . He concluded his review by saying, amid today's narcoleptic pop scene, albums like So Far, So Good ... So What offer a disruptive noise that's welcome indeed . Writing for Spin, J. D. Considine felt that the record showed a genuine maturity for the band. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau reacted toward the album with tepid positivity, and wrote that Megadeth garnered its modest portions of profit and respect with their latest studio release. He praised Anarchy in the U.K. , commenting that Mustaine covers the Sex Pistols like a champ . Retrospective reviews, however, tend to be more critical of the album. AllMusic's Steve Huey criticized the album for lacking the conceptual unity and musical bite of its predecessor. According to him, the album wants to sound threatening but mostly comes off as forced and somewhat juvenile , citing the cover track as an example. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic opined that the record is a fairly decent album, but not a great one . He felt that apart from Set the World Afire and Mary Jane , the rest of the album feels somewhat uninspired . Conversely, Adrien Begrand from MSN Music opined that the record was somehow ignored in the band's discography. The tour that followed the album's release was the first to feature new band members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young. Bassist David Ellefson said that previous members Gar Samuelson and Chris Poland were tired of constantly being on the road and their departure was inevitable. He further revealed that drummer Behler was appointed shortly before because the band feared that Samuelson would not be able to continue touring. However, some problems occurred during the Australian leg of the tour. The band was forced to cancel some of these shows because of drug issues. Mustaine claimed that the group returned home because guitarist Young ran out of heroin , which Young denied, stating that it was Mustaine who wanted to go back to Los Angeles and seek rehabilitation. Both Young and Behler were eventually fired from the band in 1989. Megadeth started performing the album's songs live before the record was released. During 1987 they toured with other thrash metal bands such as Kreator and Overkill at a number of European venues. The following year Megadeth appeared with more established heavy metal acts such as Dio and Savatage for some shows in North America. They also headlined a European tour, with support from Testament and Sanctuary. Later in 1988 the group made an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival, but were dropped from the line up after one show Megadeth was replaced by Testament. Dave Mustaine explained that the band toured quite often because they were not receiving much media exposure We do a lot of shows and sell records by word of mouth . Los Angeles Times reported that So Far, So Good... So What sold 400,000 copies one month after its release, becoming Megadeth's fastest selling album at that point. The record eventually went platinum and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene. All songs written and composed by Dave Mustaine, except where noted.

"So God Made a Farmer was a speech given by radio broadcaster Paul Harvey at the 1978 Future Farmers of America convention. The speech was first published in 1986 in Harvey's syndicated column. The speech borrowed a few phrases from a 1975 article written by Harvey in the Gadsden Times, which was itself inspired by parts of a 1940 definition of a dirt farmer published in The Farmer Stockman. The 1940 article was copied verbatim by Tex Smith in a letter to the editor in the Ellensburg Daily Record in 1949. The speech was given as an extension of the Genesis creation narrative referring to God's actions on the 8th day of creation. Harvey described the characteristics of a farmer in each phrase, ending them with the recurring So God Made a Farmer . The speech was used in a commercial by Ram Trucks during the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLVII. The ad featured photographs of rural America set to a narration of a portion of Harvey's speech. In a collaboration with the FFA, Dodge agreed to donate 100,000 for every 1,000,000 views that the YouTube video of the ad received up to 1,000,000. This goal was reached in less than five days. There were eight photographers who participated and photographed the images in this commercial Andy Anderson, Matt Turley, Olaf Veltman, Andy Mahr, Kurt Markus, David Beltra, David Spielman, Mark Gooch, Jim Arndt, William Allard, and Kurt Markus. Paul Harvey delivered the speech at an FFA convention in 1978. His speech began as a continuation of the Genesis creation narrative referring to the actions God took on the eighth day. In it, Harvey stated that God needed a caretaker for the land he created. The speech continues with God expressing the characteristics needed by the person he is creating I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle a calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry, have to await lunch until his wife's done feeding visiting ladies, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon, and mean it. Multiple passages setting out characteristics of the sort end with the same refrain, by which the speech is now known So God made a farmer. Harvey's So God Made a Farmer speech was characterized, according to The Atlantic, by its folksy timbre . The New York Times spoke further on elements of his speaking style in its 2009 obituary his style was stop and go, with superb pacing and silences that rivaled Jack Bennys. He spoke directly to the listener, with punchy sentences, occasional exclamations of Good heavens or Oh, my goodness and pauses that squeezed out the last drop of suspense the radio broadcasters equivalent of the raised eyebrow or the knowing grin. Bob Greene described the opening phrase of the speech as seemingly simple, and devastatingly direct . The speech also ran in Paul Harvey's syndicated newspaper column in 1986. Both the sound recording of the speech and the text of the article have been federally registered with the U.S. Copyright Office by Paulynne, Inc., Paul Harvey's company that is now owned by his son. In an introduction, Harvey claimed, in a typical rhetorical flourish, that he had found the essay in his mailbag. This next arrived unsigned in my mailbag. I've tried but cannot trace its source. A farmer, perhaps more likely a farmer's wife. I've embellished the essay in places and cropped it in others but I hope the sense of it remains intact. Paul Harvey ran a similar article in the column A Point of View for the Gadsden Times on August 26, 1975. Entitled What it is to be a farmer , the article did not contain the concept of God creating the farmer seen in his 1978 speech, but he still described the characteristics of a farmer. Many of the same phrases made their way into his 1978 speech. The 1975 column was largely similar to a definition of a dirt farmer given by Boston B. Blackwood from Hartshorne, Oklahoma in a 1940 copy of The Farmer Stockman. This was copied verbatim in a September 10, 1949 letter to the editor of the Ellensburg Daily Record written by Tex Smith from Ellensburg, Washington. Both the 1940 and 1975 columns share elements not included in the speech such as the statement that a farmer's wife won't let him starve. In the So God Made a Farmer speech and Harvey's 1986 column, only two phrases and a few words remain from Blackwood's 1940 piece including the phrase, can shape an axe handle from a persimmon sprout . The speech was used in a two minute Ram Trucks Super Bowl commercial entitled Farmer in Super Bowl XLVII. The ad featured a voiceover of Harvey's speech set to still photographs taken by ten photographers including William Albert Allard and Kurt Markus. Created by The Richards Group, the ad ran during the fourth quarter. It was noted for its religious imagery. The ad, like another Chrysler Super Bowl XLVII ad featuring Oprah Winfrey, advertised the brand without focusing on the vehicle. This was similar to ads run by Chrysler in Super Bowl XLVI and Super Bowl XLV. The ad was made in collaboration with the National FFA Organization and the National FFA Foundation and with permission from Harvey's company, Paulynne, Inc., and Ram agreed to donate up to 1,000,000 to the foundation based on the views received by the YouTube video. The goal, which was based on 100,000 for every 1,000,000 views, was reached in less than 5 days. The ad received mostly positive reviews. Slate called it the most striking Super Bowl ad but also criticized it for being similar in concept to a 2011 YouTube video by Farms.com. While the Slate review was criticizing its originality, Farms.com released a statement reflecting their approval of the ad. While liveblogging the Super Bowl commercials for the Wall Street Journal, Cindy Gallop referred to it as the Great American Super Bowl Commercial . Dale Buss, of Forbes, wrote Chrysler managed to insert just enough of its vehicles and brands in each spot so as to make their inclusion seem part of the fabric of the paean, not at all intrusive, thereby lending the kind of authenticity to Ram and Jeep that fuels long term brand success . The ad ranked third in the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter. Critics noted that the ad focused on the family farm despite the industrialization of agriculture in America. A Latino nonprofit organization called Cuentame uploaded a remake to its Facebook page that featured more Latinos. Country music singer James Wesley's 2013 single Thank a Farmer was inspired by the ad.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20God%20Made%20a%20Farmer
"So Happy I Could Die is a song from American singer Lady Gaga, taken from her second major released and her third extended play, The Fame Monster 2009 . It was written by herself, Nadir RedOne Khayat, and Nicolas Space Cowboy Dresti, with production helmed by RedOne. Inspired by Gaga's fear of what she described as the Alcohol Monster , the song is about the influences of alcoholism, and also explores several sexual themes in its lyrics as well as liberalism. Musically, it is a Europop song with Auto Tune effects. So Happy I Could Die received mostly positive reviews, with critics complimenting its sexual nature. The song charted in Hungary, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Performances for the song transpired during The Monster Ball Tour 20092011 , during which Gaga wore a mechanically controlled moving dress while singing the song. Lady Gaga collaborated with RedOne and Space Cowboy in writing and producing So Happy I Could Die . All three of them were the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the Alcohol Monster , as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time. In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcoholthe so called happy place and explained that her fear is split between two songs. My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. ... But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, and then all of a sudden, stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse. Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as about masturbating while thinking about a woman . While writing the song, the singer was inspired by English singer Lily Allen and Tasmin Archer's hit Sleeping Satellite 1992 . So Happy I Could Die is a mid tempo Europop song, which is filled with Auto Tune, giving it an echoing effect. According to the music sheet published by Sony ATV Music Publishing on the website Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of A3 to A4 and the song follows a basic sequence of FGEmAm as its chord progression. As Gaga sings the chorus, its melody emulates Natasha Bedingfield's Pocketful of Sunshine 2008 . Paul Lester of BBC suggested that So Happy I Could Die is reflective of the LGBT themes common in Gaga's songs, while Slant Magazine journalist Sal Cinquemani asserted that it telegraphed the instructive execution of the singer's rejection of any and all intimacy with others . 'So Happy I Could Die' is a love song, he remarked, but the object of her affection is herselflooking at herself, drinking with herself, dancing with herself, touching herself. Academic Richard J. Gray found parallels between the song and the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood . He noted that through the song's lyrics, Gaga embodied both the young girl as well as the ravenous wolf. Gaga acts as the viewer, the drinker as well as the sexual aggressor. In the book, The Performance Identities of Lady Gaga, Gray expanded on his analysis of the lyrics In the wilderness of the dance floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf pelt, Gaga is engaging in a moment of self acceptance and self soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that it will be difficult to maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual ghostly side. Comparisons between the song and Britney Spears's Touch of My Hand from the latter's fourth studio album In The Zone were made by music critics. However, Bradley Stern of the music website MuuMuse remarked that its lyrics and music were too dark to place in the same realm as Spears' ode to self exploration . During the chorus Gaga sings, Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time Hey ey, Hey ey So happy I could die. Melinda Newman from the website HitFix compared the song's sound with Madonna while also noting similarities in the refrain containing the lines hey ey hey ey to Rihanna. Tony Hardy from the website Consequence of Sound described So Happy I Could Die as a chilled song with lyrics open to interpretation. He felt that potential themes of the song may be Sapphic desires, the singer's alter ego and transient effects of wine and fame. A writer of Popjustice compared the song's ravey beats with work by DJ Tiesto. Describing it as a pop fluff song, Simon Price of The Independent wrote that there's always a suggestion of something interesting going on behind those glitter encrusted eyes . NME's Ben Patashnik applauded the song's suggestive nature 'So Happy I Could Die' perfectly evokes the feeling of being alone in a crowded room with its icy beats, suggesting Gaga takes refuge in masturbation as the only way to retain control. So Happy I Could Die was declared as the twenty seventh best Lady Gaga song by Rolling Stone, who concluded Gaga exults in the pleasures of club hopping, drinking and bi curiosity. Under the Radar columnist Nick Hyman avouched that So Happy I Could Die was an uninspiring track, while Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that Gaga's vocals were the worst out of any of her songs. It's a bit of a disappointment, too, because for someone who is so painfully deliberate in crafting their unique visual image, its a let down to see that some of that quality control couldnt be applied to the song selection that will ultimately define their legacy. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse felt that the song was a continuation to Gaga's own Starstruck from The Fame, as they had the same squeaky synthesizers and urban flavoring to engage in some self indulgence . He went on to describe its music and lyrics as dark while also calling the song inimal and moody . Digital Spy's Nick Levine described the singer as titillating in the song while singing about 'touching herself' at the sight of a 'lavender blonde' . Melinda Newman from the website HitFix felt the song gave a chance to Gaga to explore her singing talents and concluded, Hypnotic and a fun sing along, this could be a single. Tony Hardy from Consequence of Sound noted that the song, which had a promising title was not that bad . An editor of Popjustice felt that the song was not suitable for a single release but noted it was important to the whole 'Fame Monster' thing . A more mixed review came from a writer of the website musicOMH who felt that the pace of The Fame Monster slowed slightly with So Happy I Could Die . He went on to describe its lyrics as too contrived and added that it lacks the fizz of the earlier tracks . Similarly, Andrew Ryce from Beats per Minute felt that the song was an unconvincing anthem for hedonism, sounding more like a wistful lament than a party track . Upon release of the album, So Happy I Could Die garnered minor commercial success. It attained its highest position in Hungary, where it peaked at number ten on the Hungarian Singles Chart on the chart issue dated November 23, 2009. In Europe, it managed to debut in musical charts in Sweden and the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number fifty three and eighty four, respectively. In the US, the song charted at number 35 on the Billboard Dance Electronic Digital Songs for the issue dated April 3, 2010. So Happy I Could Die was part of the setlist of Gaga's second headlining concert tour, The Monster Ball 20092011 . On the first version of the tour, Gaga performed the song alongside Teeth , wearing a black leather corset. During the revamped Monster Ball shows, it was performed after playing some of her songs on the piano. She was then caught by a tornado , which was portrayed by a cylinder shaped video screen lowered from the ceiling, covering the singer. Reappearing on stage, Gaga started performing the song while a hydraulic lift raised her high up in the air. She was seen wearing her Living Dress , a white costume that moves on its own accord, complete with wings and a long train. The dress was mechanically and remotely controlled for its movements. It was inspired by the creations of designer Hussein Chalayan and was made by Vin Burnham. Gaga's references for the performance was both Dorothy as well as Glinda the Good Witch, from the 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz. According to Academic Richard J. Gray, Gaga merged both the characters in the performance, demonstrating the overall story arc of the tour, about self sufficiency towards freedom and personal growth. He also listed is as the most awe inspiring and show stopping sight of the . Credits adapted from The Fame Monster album liner notes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20Happy%20I%20Could%20Die
"So It's Come to This A Simpsons Clip Show is the eighteenth episode of The Simpsons' fourth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April Fools' Day, 1993. In the episode, Homer plays a series of practical jokes on Bart, and to get even, Bart shakes up a can of Homer's beer with a paint shaker. Homer opens the can, resulting in a huge explosion that lands him in the hospital, where he goes into a coma. At Homer's bedside, the Simpson family reminisce, mainly about moments relevant to Homer's life. Jon Vitti wrote the episode, and Carlos Baeza directed it. This is The Simpsons' first clip show, and it features clips from the first three seasons of the series. It was created to relieve the long hours put in by all of the show's overworked staff. The episode features cultural references to films such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Fantastic Voyage. The episode received positive reviews from critics. It was called as good as a clip show ever gets and acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.9. The story begins on April Fools' Day as Homer is playing pranks on Bart throughout the day. Bart, angered by the numerous tricks he has fallen for, attempts to get revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital, paralyzed and placed in a wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown in the form of clips from past episodes. At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, while trying to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries to pull the plug on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies unconscious in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that he was the one who put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5 of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing. The episode originally aired on April Fools' Day, 1993 on the Fox network. It was directed by Carlos Baeza, and written by Jon Vitti with contributions from Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen, Wallace Wolodarsky, John Swartzwelder, Jeff Martin, George Meyer, and Nell Scovell. The idea for the 32 D'oh s in a row footage was from David Silverman's montage that he had assembled for his traveling college show. So It's Come to This A Simpsons Clip Show was The Simpsons' first clip show, created to relieve the long hours put in by all of the show's overworked staff. There was intense pressure on producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. However, writers and producers felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode cost to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price. Despite the nature of the clip show, the episode still contained an act and a half of new animation, including the extra scene from Bart the Daredevil in which Homer falls down Springfield Gorge a second time after the ambulance crashes into a tree. The network censors initially refused to let the phrase beer causes rectal cancer into the show. The censors eventually relented when they found a medical textbook which stated the link between beer and cancer, but still asked them to go easy on beer in the future. This flashback episode uses clips from episodes released during the first three seasons four are from the first, five from the second, and six from the third season. Grandpa's line to Homer, The world was never meant for one as beautiful as you is from the song Vincent by Don McLean. The scene where Barney attempts to smother Homer with a pillow and breaks a hospital window with a water fountain is a parody of the final scene in Milos Forman's 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Professor Frink's suggestion of shrinking a crew of men to microscopic size and sending them into Homer in a small submarine is a reference to Richard Fleischer's 1966 film Fantastic Voyage. There are also many cultural references in the clips from previous episodes. The clip of Homer picking up Marge and carrying her off in his arms into the distance is a reference to the theme of the 1982 film, An Officer and a Gentleman. Bart stealing Homer's penny jar and trying to escape is an almost shot for shot parody of the opening sequence in the 1981 film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, while John Williams' Raiders March plays throughout. The scene in which Maggie hits Homer over the head with a mallet is an extensive parody of the shower scene from Psycho the music and camera angles are almost identical. In its original American broadcast, So It's Come to This A Simpsons Clip Show finished fourteenth in the ratings for the week of March 28 to April 4, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9. It was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode has received positive reviews, being labeled as good as a clip show ever gets , and containing some memorable gags. It has been seen as one of the most consistently funny episodes of the series , which strikes that perfect balance between perfectly selected classic moments and all new story segments... The episode's reference to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was named the 43rd greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film's Nathan Ditum. In 2015, executive producer Al Jean reacted to a hypothesis that Homer is still in a coma and all episodes since this one have been imaginary, hence a perceived surrealism and frequent guest appearances. He said that the hypothesis belongs in the intriguing but false file .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20It%27s%20Come%20to%20This%3A%20A%20Simpsons%20Clip%20Show

Lead singer Bart Millard has described the story behind So Long Self as ...really simple Its Not About . It never has been and it never will be. Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe the same thing happened to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him . The song is also lyrically about a break up with sinful human nature. So Long Self was written and composed by MercyMe.

With a lyrical hook sure to have radio listeners singing along, this song finds Millard bidding farewell to sinful nature and moving closer to Christ . Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that It almost seems like MercyMe is overcompensating to gain artistic credibility with the bouncy single 'So Long Self,' an undeniably catchy breakup song with our sinful nature that echoes Chapman covering The Beatles, going so far as to playfully evoke a carnival in the bridge . Upon release, the song was added by fifty two Christian AC stations a record for the most adds in the history of the Christian AC chart.

When the band realizes it cannot possibly be playing a 'live' soundcheck since they are in their tour bus, they exit the vehicle to stop the imposters. The real band members trap the fakes in a room, and then go out on stage and perform. Near the end of the video, security kicks the fake band members out of the arena. Matt Johnson of Jesus Freak Hideout commented about the video on his review of MercyMe's album 10, noting that Most people think of serious worshipful songs such as I Can Only Imagine Word of God Speak when they think of MercyMe, but the So Long Self video captures a side that most don't think of, their fun side .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%20Long%20Self
"So Sad is a song by English musician George Harrison that was released on his 1974 album Dark Horse. Harrison originally recorded the song for his previous album, Living in the Material World, before giving it to Alvin Lee, the guitarist and singer with Ten Years After. Lee recorded it as So Sad No Love of His Own with gospel singer Mylon LeFevre for their 1973 album On the Road to Freedom. The latter recording includes contributions from Harrison and marked the first of many collaborations between him and Lee. Harrison began writing So Sad in New York in 1972 about the failure of his first marriage, to Pattie Boyd. The lyrics present a stark winter imagery that contrasts with the springtime optimism of his Beatles composition Here Comes the Sun . Harrison recorded his version of the song during a period of romantic intrigue surrounding his marriage and those of fellow musicians Ron Wood and Ringo Starr. The main recording session took place at Harrison and Boyd's home, Friar Park, in November 1973, eight months before she left him for Eric Clapton. Aside from Harrison's extensive contributions on vocals, guitars and keyboards, the musicians on the recording include Starr, Nicky Hopkins and Jim Keltner. Several reviewers have highlighted So Sad as a standout track on the otherwise disappointing Dark Horse album. While noting its bleak depiction of lost love, author Simon Leng describes the song as the temporary death of Harrison's Krishna dream , reflecting the singer's surrender to human sorrow over his spiritual resolve. George Harrison, 1979 In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison recalls that he started writing So Sad in 1972 while in New York. He reproduces his original lyrics in the book, written on stationery from the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan. Harrison identifies this period as when he was breaking up with his first wife, Pattie Boyd, although the couple did not formally separate until July 1974, when Boyd left him for Eric Clapton. Al Aronowitz, a New York based journalist and a friend of the Harrisons, later expressed his surprise at the failure of their marriage, saying I never saw the breakup coming ... around them everything seemed magical. Harrison and Boyd met on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night in 1964 and were married two years later. By the late 1960s, however, they had begun to grow apart due to Harrison's preoccupation with meditation and other spiritual pursuits. In an effort to regain her husband's attention, in 1970, Boyd responded to Clapton's long held infatuation with her, only to reject his advances at that time. Unable to conceive a child, and with Harrison averse to adoption, Boyd resumed her career as a fashion model in May 1971, an activity that sat at odds with his spiritual convictions. According to Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley, the first public signs of a rift in the marriage came in August 1972. That month, Harrison travelled alone through Europe to Portugal to visit Gary Wright, who then played the diplomat by fending off press speculation regarding Boyd's absence. Author Ian Inglis describes So Sad as the first Harrison composition to explicitly address the collapse of his marriage . The song was copyrighted to Harrisongs in November 1973 as So Sad No Love of His Own , a title that recalls that of the Everly Brothers' hit So Sad To Watch Good Love Go Bad . Along with his song So Sad , Harrison's 1974 album Dark Horse included a version of the Everly Brothers' Bye Bye, Love , the lyrics of which he altered to sarcastically address Boyd's eloping with Clapton. While expressing confusion over the motivation behind this reworking of Bye Bye, Love , Inglis views So Sad as a reflection of the profound sense of loss that Harrison genuinely felt. Among other examples of the depth of the couple's shared experiences, Inglis cites Boyd's role as Harrison's companion at the height of Beatlemania, their joint embrace of Indian spirituality, and her presence throughout his emergence as a solo artist. So Sad is in 4 4 time throughout, while its musical key changes from C major in the verses to D major over the choruses. The song opens and closes with a descending, eight bar instrumental passage. In between these two passages, it comprises three combinations of verse and chorus. While Clapton has commented on Harrison's cavalier attitude to his pursuit of Boyd in 1970, and Boyd has described her husband's behaviour as cold and indifferent , the song conveys his despair at the failure of their relationship. In his lyrics, Harrison revisits the weather themed imagery of his late period Beatles compositions All Things Must Pass and Here Comes the Sun . Whereas the latter song conveyed optimism and rejuvenation, however, So Sad reflects the onset of winter and, in author Simon Leng's description, hope replaced with tiredness, sunshine supplanted by gloom . Author Bruce Spizer writes that the opening lines alone Now the winter has come Eclipsing the sun That has lighted my love for some time evoke the opposite emotions of Harrison's uplifting 'Here Comes the Sun' . The singer's viewpoint changes between the first and third person during the song. At the start of the choruses, Harrison describes himself as the protagonist who feels so alone With no love of his own . These words accompany a chord sequence comprising D major, D augmented, D6 and E7 over which the melody ascends, creating musical tension. The ensuing refrain provides what Leng terms cathartic release with the repeated phrase So sad So bad . While he expresses sorrow throughout the song, Harrison avoids detailing the reasons for the end of the relationship. In the second verse, he sings of the problem of just being there a line that theologian Dale Allison interprets as central to Harrison's philosophical outlook, which espoused striving to transcend the mundane aspects of human existence. Author Joshua Greene describes So Sad as a song that tells of cold winds, lost love, and dreams abandoned . In the final verse, Harrison urges his lover to give the dawn of the day to someone who can rekindle their shared dream. He concludes with a lyric that Inglis deems poignant in its revelation of the singer's feelings of loss It's too late for to make a new start. Harrison initially recorded So Sad for Living in the Material World 1973 , his most overtly religious album, but did not include the track on that release. The recording sessions took place between October 1972 and February 1973, at the Beatles' Apple Studio in London and at Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT, in Henley on Thames. The personnel at the sessions were Harrison, keyboard players Wright and Nicky Hopkins, drummers Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner, and bass player Klaus Voormann many of whom later played on Harrison's official version of the song. Among other unreleased recordings from the Material World sessions, Harrison and Starr taped a version of their joint composition Photograph in December 1972. Another song about lost love, Photograph presents a similarly bleak picture of a failed romance, sharing with So Sad the theme that any possibility of a reunion between the two protagonists has long passed. Harrison became friends with Ten Years After frontman Alvin Lee after the two guitarists met in Henley's Row Barge pub. Hearing that Lee was recording a solo album with American gospel singer Mylon LeFevre, Harrison offered him So Sad , which they recorded together in August 1973. Also playing on the session was drummer Mick Fleetwood, who was married to Boyd's sister Jenny at the time, and Faces guitarist Ron Wood. According to Ten Years After biographer Herb Staehr, Lee, Harrison and Wood were part of the Thames Valley Gang of English rock musicians, who met regularly at Lee's Hook End Manor property in Woodcote, close to Harrison's Friar Park estate in Henley. As well as including the parenthetical No Love of His Own in the title, the LeeLeFevre version of So Sad differs from Harrison's in mood. Performed in the country style, with a dobro part by Harrison, the recording highlights the song's heartbreak aspects , according to Leng, who likens it to 'Jolene' and other country tearjerkers . Among several further collaborations between Lee and Harrison, Lee made a guest appearance on the debut album by Splinter, which Harrison was producing for his new Dark Horse record label. In addition, Lee, together with Wood, played on Harrison's Dark Horse track Ding Dong, Ding Dong . The song was released on Lee and LeFevre's On the Road to Freedom album in November 1973, and as the A side of a single the following month. The album was critically well received, and Billboard included So Sad among its recommended singles for the week of 22 December 1973. Writing in Rolling Stone, Bud Scoppa paired the track with the Wood composed Let 'Em Say What They Will as two non originals are beauties , adding George Harrison's 'So Sad No Love of His Own ' sounds to me like one of his best songs. So Sad was the oldest of the songs written by Harrison and recorded for Dark Horse, the sessions for which began in November 1973. Author Peter Doggett describes Friar Park as having become a haven of adulterous intrigue by this time, with Harrison conducting an affair with Maureen Starkey, the wife of his former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr. This dalliance followed an episode of wife swapping between the Harrisons and the Woods, when Wood embarked on a brief affair with Boyd in the Bahamas as Harrison holidayed with Wood's wife Krissy in Portugal. Late that year, rumours of problems in the Harrisons' marriage circulated after Wood announced to the British press that my romance with Patti is definitely on . The basic track for So Sad was taped at FPSHOT with Phil McDonald as the recording engineer. Aside from Harrison, the musicians included Hopkins on piano and Starr and Keltner on drums . According to Starr's comments in a contemporary interview, the session took place in November 1973 while confirming this date in a press conference the following year, Harrison said that Voormann also participated on bass. The bass part was subsequently overdubbed by Willie Weeks, whom Harrison first met in June 1974 while they were both working on Wood's first solo album, I've Got My Own Album to Do. Harrison played a wide range of instruments on the song. Credited as guitars and the other things , these include 12 string acoustic guitars, electric piano and slide guitar parts. Due to his other commitments, which included setting up Dark Horse Records and organising his and Ravi Shankar's joint North American tour, Harrison had to complete songs such as So Sad in Los Angeles in October 1974. There, the combination of recording and tour rehearsals overtaxed his voice, leading to him contracting laryngitis, which marred his vocal performances on Dark Horse and during the subsequent tour. While ruing that Dark Horse made Harrison's affliction a matter of public record , authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter consider that the subject matter of So Sad , like the album's title track, invited this more tortured style of singing. In his description of the completed recording, Leng views the song as a harrowing encounter, a far more savage affair than the Alvin Lee take , due to the musical arrangement and the pained mood established by Harrison's vocals. He adds that the weeping slide guitar riffs contribute to a musical catharsis that recalls Lennon's primal therapy inspired Plastic Ono Band album. Harrison in October 1974 Apple Records issued Dark Horse in December 1974, with So Sad sequenced as the third track on side one of the LP. It appeared as the second of three autobiographical songs detailing Harrison's troubled personal life, preceded by Simply Shady , his account of decadence in the music industry, and followed by Bye Bye, Love . During his pre tour press conference in October, Harrison likened the album to the television soap opera Peyton Place. He also expressed his happiness for Boyd and Clapton, saying Eric Clapton has been a close friend for years ... I'd rather she was with him than some dope. Like the HarrisonShankar North American tour, Dark Horse received mainly unfavourable reviews from music critics, many of whom condemned Harrison for his hoarse singing and for having rushed the recording to capitalise on the tour. In his highly unfavourable critique for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller considered So Sad to be one of the album's few resonant moments and a song that probably tells the truth regarding Harrison's state of mind, unlike Bye, Bye Love , which he found a sick man's idea of a joke . Bob Woffinden of the NME labelled So Sad a trite, self pitying number, both unoriginal and lifeless, with the vocals again sounding portentous and unnatural . Woffinden added When somebody sings 'While his memory raced with much speed and great haste', you just know the lyricist is floundering and filling in lines. Writing in Circus Raves magazine, Michael Gross described the track as luxurious , with a guitar introduction that to the poverty of loneliness . Billboard's reviewer said the album was an excellent one and listed So Sad first among its best cuts . In his 1977 book Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner similarly identified the track as a highlight of Dark Horse, adding that the effect of the opening guitar collage made for delectable listening . Simon Leng considers So Sad to be the antithesis of Here Comes the Sun , marking the temporary death of George's Krishna dream as spiritual conviction proves inadequate against the human pain of separation . He comments on how the Dark Horse version was he subject of scorn on release , yet Lee and LeFevre's recording of So Sad merited not a single critical sneer the year before according to Leng, this contrast illustrates the difficulty of being George Harrison in 1974 . Writing in their Solo Beatles Compendium, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter view the recording as one of the more impressive tunes on Dark Horse, adding that Harrison's 12 string guitar work is particularly striking . AllMusic's Richard Ginell nominates So Sad as one of two AMG track picks on Dark Horse. Writing for the music website Something Else , Nick DeRiso includes the song among the five often forgotten gems from Harrison's Apple Records discography, and notes its elegiac tone , similar to that of Living in the Material World. Reviewing Harrison's career for Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson described So Sad as overlong but classic Harrison nevertheless. New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid dismisses Dark Horse as a sloppy and slapdash album before adding but as always he could craft a lovely melody. So Sad mightn't find him in great voice but you can hear a fine song in there as he explores his inner loneliness ... Writing for vintagerock.com, Shawn Perry describes the track as ruefully poignant and a song that overflows with a flavour simple and sincere beauty . In his liner note essay to the 2003 reissue of On the Road to Freedom, Chris Welch concludes by referring to Lee's sorrow at the death of Harrison in November 2001, as well as his satisfaction that So Sad is part of an album that recalls the carefree days of rock'n'roll fun and freedom . Iain Matthews, a former member of Fairport Convention, released a cover of the song on his 1993 compilation Orphans Outcasts, Vol. 1. In 2011, Matthews' version appeared on the multi artist Harrison Uncovered CD, which accompanied a feature by Mojo tying in with the release of Martin Scorsese's documentary George Harrison Living in the Material World.

"So Seductive is a song by Tony Yayo as the first single from his debut album Thoughts of a Predicate Felon 2005 , it features guest vocals from 50 Cent, and was produced by Punch, who helped write the song along with Tony Yayo and 50 Cent. Released following a highly publicized campaign by G Unit, to release Tony Yayo from prison prior to the song's release, So Seductive is an uptempo club banger containing elements of string instruments and a repetitive bassline in its instrumentation. The song received little promotion from Tony Yayo at the time of its release, as he was still under house arrest following the end of his prison sentence, although he has since performed the song during various live performances. So Seductive became Tony Yayo's most commercially successful song, peaking at 48 on the Billboard Hot 100 it also remains Tony Yayo's only song to chart outside the United States, peaking in the top 30 of the Irish and United Kingdom singles charts. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its energy and 50 Cent's performance in the chorus, although some wrote negatively towards Yayo's rapping and also noted a lack of originality in the song's production. So Seductive was nominated for best Club Banger at the 2005 Vibe Awards, but lost to 1 Thing by Amerie. On December 31, 2002, G Unit rappers Tony Yayo and 50 Cent were arrested for illegal weapon possession. Following a further background check, it was discovered that Yayo had an outstanding warrant for a previous such charge as a result, he was sentenced for bail jumping, and spent the entirety of 2003 in prison at Lakeview Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility. During this time, G Unit rose to mainstream prominence following the commercial success of 50 Cent's album Get Rich or Die Tryin' 2003 , which sold 872,000 copies in its 1st week on sale in the United States and contained the Billboard 1 singles In Da Club and 21 Questions . The group also released their debut album, Beg for Mercy, in 2003, which featured the US top 15 singles Stunt 101 and Wanna Get to Know You . Yayo appeared on the song Like My Style , which appears on Get Rich or Die Tryin', and on the songs Groupie Love and I Smell Pussy , which are included on Beg for Mercy. During Tony Yayo's incarceration, G Unit began a campaign called Free Yayo , which involved wearing Free Yayo shirts advertising his situation due to the mainstream prominence of the group, Tony Yayo began to receive increased attention from the Hip Hop community, becoming known as the mythical 4th member of G Unit , although Yayo himself was unaware of the coverage he attracted. The campaign received widespread publicity, even in countries such as Brazil and Iraq. At the 46th Grammy Awards, 50 Cent and Eminem performed whilst wearing Free Yayo shirts. Yayo watched the performance on television in prison after receiving a call from the Shady offices advising him to do so he had never seen the shirts before, and was inspired by them to work hard to improve his rapping before his release from prison. He was granted parole from his sentence on January 8, 2004, but was discovered to be in possession of a forged passport, following a check from his parole officer, and was sent back to prison until May 25, 2004. Following his release, Tony Yayo appeared on several mixtapes to increase his exposure amongst underground hip hop audiences, and began to record his debut album, titled Thoughts of a Predicate Felon 2005 , almost immediately after leaving prison, although he was still detained under house arrest and required to wear an ankle bracelet, and thus could not personally promote any of the album's material. So Seductive was released as the album's 1st single via Interscope in the United States and Canada on May 17, 2005 via Music download, and was released to rhythmic and urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on May 24, 2005. The CD single was distributed via Polydor Records. The song was featured in the 2005 Xbox video game 50 Cent Bulletproof. Tony Yayo appears in the video game providing his own voice and likeness and is a playable character in arcade mode. So Seductive was written by Tony Yayo, 50 Cent and Michael Harper, and was produced by the latter under his production name Punch, who was also responsible for the song's instruments. Stu Bassie Brooks played additional bass instruments. The song was recorded by Ky Miller at G Unit Studios a recording studio in New York City, New York. Audio mixing was carried out by Steve Baughman at Right Track Studios, a recording studio which is also in New York City, New York. The song was mastered by Brian Big Bass Gardner. So Seductive is listed 5th on the track listing for Thoughts of a Predicate Felon and is of 3 minutes and 30 seconds in length. It is a hip hop song with influences of club music, and is backed by a looped production containing elements of synthesizers and string instruments, and a repetitive bassline. Evan McGarvey of The Michigan Daily noted the song to contain cracking, unstable hi hats . Critics have described So Seductive as a club banger and a hooky party number , indicating its uptempo nature. The song's singsong chorus is partly performed by 50 Cent. So Seductive received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many naming it a standout track from Thoughts of a Predicate Felon. Stylus Magazine writer Ross McGowan called the song a two headed attack that resulted in one of the summers best singles , and complimented how the song fits Tony Yayo's persona, writing that So Seductive is practically a blueprint for how Tony Yayo should be packaged. He isnt a very good rapper, but he is an entertaining personality and crew member. David Jeffries of Allmusic described So Seductive as a hooky party number that Yayo handles extremely well , citing it as an example of how he craftier and smarter than expected considering the thug myth built around him . Writing for The Michigan Daily, Evan McGarvey observed that the song works as a servicable first single , calling it an open palm slap of a tune . He also complimented 50 Cent's performance, writing that he wisely takes a verse of his own and laces the track with an easy, Richard Scary hook . However, Fiona McKinlay of musicOMH denounced Tony Yayo's rapping on the song, calling his vocals really pretty disappointing . She also criticized the song's production as unoriginal, noting that there's nothing catchy, nothing memorable and it's not even any good for shaking your booty to , and concluded that as anything other than musical wallpaper, is about as much use as soggy toast , although she conceded that it was probably going to be a Top Ten smash . At the 2005 Vibe Awards, So Seductive was nominated for best Club Banger , but lost to 1 Thing by singer Ameriie. So Seductive debuted at 67 on the US Billboard Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart issue dated May 14, 2005 it went on to spend 19 weeks on the chart, and peaked at 7, making it Tony Yayo's only song to date to reach the top ten of the chart.

During the party, Tony Yayo enters another room of the mansion and removes a painting from one of the walls, revealing a hidden safe after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman Buffie Carruth who has followed him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room.

"So Wrong, It's Right is the second studio album by American rock band All Time Low. Following an unsuccessful showcase for Fueled by Ramen, Hopeless Records signed All Time Low in March 2006. They released an EP, Put Up or Shut Up, through the label in July of that year. After amassing 12 songs by January 2007, the band demoed some of them for Paul Leavitt. The group began recording So Wrong, It's Right in April at SOMD Studios in Beltsville, Maryland with producers Leavitt and Matt Squire. The band wrote five additional songs while in the studio. Following an acoustic tour in June, the band participated in Warped Tour, and Dear Maria, Count Me In was made available for streaming. After premiering a music video for Six Feet Under the Stars , So Wrong, It's Right was released on September 25. The band spent the next three months supporting Boys Like Girls on their US tour. In early 2008, a music video was released for Dear Maria, Count Me In , which was followed by an appearance at the Soundwave festival in Australia in February and March. The group participated in the Alternative Press Tour, and appeared at The Bamboozle and Give it a Name festivals, between March and May. Dear Maria, Count Me In was released to radio around this time. In July, the band went on a headlining US tour, before taking part in Warped Tour. A deluxe edition of the album followed at the end of July, featuring acoustic versions of songs and music videos. In early August, a music video was premiered for Poppin' Champagne on MTV's FNMTV. Later in the month, the band took part in the mtvU Video Music Awards Tour performing at several Six Flags locations, before embarking on a US tour in October and November. Poppin' Champagne was released as a single in December featuring two different versions of the track. So Wrong, It's Right sold 14,225 copies in its first week of release, charting at number 62 on the Billboard 200, as well as reaching the top 20 on several other Billboard charts. The album went on to sell over 180,000 copies by May 2009. Dear Maria, Count Me In was certified Gold and then Platinum by the RIAA in April 2011 and April 2015, respectively. So Wrong, It's Right was later certified Gold by the RIAA in May 2017. The album received a mostly positive response from critics, with several reviewers praising the album's pop punk sound. All Time Low released their debut album The Party Scene in July 2005 through independent label Emerald Moon Records. In December, it was announced that the band was no longer signed, but were attracting attention from a number of record labels. In late 2006, the band performed a showcase for John Janick the founder of record label Fueled by Ramen. They were not signed because Cute Is What We Aim For had recently been taken on by the label, which was not in a position to sign another band at the time. On March 28, 2006, it was announced that All Time Low had signed with Hopeless Records. The band was brought to the label's attention by fellow touring band Amber Pacific. Following high school graduation, the members focused on the group full time, and released the Put Up or Shut Up EP in July. Vocalist guitarist Alex Gaskarth said the EP helped the band gain new fans, while at the same time allowing them time to progress musically. Gaskarth also said that the group did not want to feel pressured or rushed to make an album. Opting to release the EP instead made the most sense as far as where we were and what we wanted to do . To support its release, the group appeared on a number of Warped Tour dates and toured with Amber Pacific. Gaskarth revealed the band was aiming to enter the recording studio in the winter. In December, the group performed a number of shows. At one of these, they played three new tracks Let It Roll , Dear Maria, Count Me In and Remembering Sunday . In January 2007, the band said they had composed 12 songs for their second album. Around this time, the group demoed a handful of songs for Paul Leavitt. The band began recording on April 17, 2007, with producers Matt Squire and Leavitt at SOMD Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. The group previously worked with Leavitt on The Party Scene 2005 and the Put Up or Shut Up EP. According to a studio update posted on April 20, guitarist Jack Barakat revealed the band was in pre production. The group listened to the demos they had recorded previously, picking and choosing which songs they would work on further, as well as parts of other songs they wanted to retain. Gaskarth said the band went into the studio with around 15 songs, before that number was whittled down to three. They subsequently wrote a lot of material in the studio. In another studio update posted on April 27, Barakat mentioned they had narrowed down the songs that would make the album. Gaskarth said the group needed to write more songs, which resulted in the creation of five additional songs. One of these songs was Come One, Come All , a track Gaskarth strongly disliked in retrospect. Barakat, who shared Gaskarth's view on the song, added that other songs from the same time would have served better on the record. Barakat mentioned 11 would be on the album, and that they could potentially add ...another here or there if all goes as planned . Barakat said the band's members felt that ... we have grown as musicians, with assistance from Squire and Leavitt. Squire worked closely with Gaskarth on creating melodies, while Leavitt worked with drummer Rian Dawson creating, as Barakat describes them, beastly drum beats . Barakat mentioned that the drum and bass parts were done pretty straight forward and quick since Dawson and bassist Zack Merrick were solid on their respective instruments. While the bass was being recorded, Squire was working with Gaskarth on vocals. Squire and Leavitt engineered the recordings, while Squire mixed them. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound. All the songs on the album were written by All Time Low with lyrics by Gaskarth. Sam Hollander and Dave Katz provided additional writing and lyrics on Holly Would You Turn Me On . Juliet Simms of Automatic Loveletter provided additional vocals on Remembering Sunday . The group, along with the Dangerous Summer, Matt Flyzik, Dan Dori, Jason Park and Alex Grieco performed gang vocals. In June 2007, the group went on an acoustic tour alongside Morning Light and Just Surrender, during which videos of the band performing Stay Awake Dreams Only Last for a Night were posted online. From late June to late August, the band went on the 2007 edition of Warped Tour. The band then revealed that their second album would be released in September and would be titled So Wrong, It's Right. On July 3, Dear Maria, Count Me In was made available for streaming via Alternative Press. The album's track listing was revealed on August 3. On August 19, Six Feet Under the Stars was released as a free download via the band's Myspace profile. In August and September, the group went on a UK tour with Plain White T's. This was followed by a US East Coast tour with The Starting Line. On September 21, So Wrong, It's Right was made available for streaming via the band's Myspace profile. A day later, the group performed an album release show at the Recher Theatre in Towson, Maryland. A music video for Six Feet Under the Stars premiered on September 24. On September 25, 2007, So Wrong, It's Right was released through Hopeless Records. The Japanese edition included acoustic versions of Break Out Break Out and Stay Awake Dreams Only Last for a Night , as well as the music video for Coffee Shop Soundtrack . The group supported Boys Like Girls on their US headlining tour, dubbed Tourzilla, from late September to late November, and played at a series of in store performances in October. In January and February 2008, the band went on the Manwhores and Open Sores Tour with Every Avenue, Mayday Parade and Just Surrender. A music video for Dear Maria, Count Me In , directed by Travis Kopach, premiered on Total Request Live on February 12, 2008. In February and March, the band performed at the Soundwave festival in Australia, as well as two additional sideshows. On March 3, the band made their television debut performing on Jimmy Kimmel Live , performing Dear Maria, Count Me In . Between mid March and early May 2008, the group co headlined the Alternative Press Tour with The Rocket Summer, followed by appearances at The Bamboozle and Give it a Name festivals, in the US and UK respectively. Dear Maria, Count Me In was released to radio on May 6. Later that month, the band went on a co headlining UK tour with Cobra Starship, supported by Broadway Calls. In early July 2008, a music video was filmed for Poppin' Champagne in New York City with director Kopach. Shortly afterward, the group went on a headlining US tour with Hit the Lights, Valencia and There for Tomorrow. The band performed on Warped Tour from July 23 until August 18. A deluxe edition of the album was released on July 29, 2008. It featured a video mix of Poppin' Champagne , acoustic versions of Dear Maria, Count Me In , Six Feet Under the Stars , Let It Roll , and Stay Awake Dreams Only Last for a Night , as well as music videos for Dear Maria, Count Me In and Six Feet Under the Stars . A music video for Poppin' Champagne premiered on MTV's FNMTV on August 1, 2008. Gaskarth later said that if he could take that video back, I totally would. It's just so absurd and terrible . In August and September, the band performed at various Six Flags locations as part of the mtvU Video Music Awards Tour. In October and November, the group was part of the Compromising of Integrity, Morality, Principles in Exchange for Money tour in the US, alongside Mayday Parade, the Maine and Every Avenue.

"Soaring Stones, also known as Rouse Rocks, Soaring Rocks, and Stones on Sticks, is a 1990 granite and steel sculpture by John T. Young. It was first installed in the Transit Mall of Portland, Oregon, and was later sited as Soaring Stones 4 at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. The sculpture was commissioned for 100,000 to replace a fountain that was removed during construction of Pioneer Place. During the construction of the MAX Light Rail in 2006, it was removed and returned to Young, who then donated the work to Whitman College. The sculpture is intended to represent the interface between man and nature it features six irregular Washington granite rock forms installed in a row, in order of ascending height. The work inspired David Glenn, professor of music at Whitman College, to compose a piano quintet piece titled Sculpture Garden for Piano Quintet for the 2009 Walla Walla Chamber Music Festival. John T. Young's Soaring Stones was commissioned in 1989 for 100,000 as a gift to city residents by Pioneer Place, Ltd., an affiliate of Rouse Portland, Inc., to replace a fountain that was removed during construction of the Pioneer Place mall. The sculpture was completed and installed at Southwest 5th Street between Taylor Street and Yamhill Street in downtown Portland's Transit Mall in 1990. The sculpture was surveyed and deemed as treatment needed by the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture program in October 1993, and was administered by Rouse Portland, Inc., Pioneer Place, Ltd. at that time. In 2006, the sculpture was removed and returned to its owner due to construction of the MAX Light Rail. The University of Washington's Architectural Commission considered moving the work to a very unique site because of its design and size. Young was a professor of art at the institution. In 2007, Young donated the work to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, where it was installed outside Cordiner Hall as Soaring Stones 4. According to Young, Soaring Stones represents the interface between man and nature . It consists of six irregularly shaped pieces of Washington granite that were quarried from the Cascade Range, displayed in a row in ascending height. While installed in Portland, the first stone was sunk into the pavement. The rest were set on polished stainless steel pedestals, the tallest of which reached 11.5 ft 3.5 m . Elevated boulders had recessed lighting. The Smithsonian Institution described the sculpture as reminiscent of the Cascade Mountain Range from which the media came , and categorized it as abstract and allegorical of nature. Alongside the sculpture was a plaque that said, SOARING STONES BY JOHN T. YOUNG, SEATTLE, WA 1990 SPONSORED BY PIONEER PLACE LTD. Installed at the Whitman College campus, Soaring Stones 4 spans 150 ft 46 m and the highest of its rocks reaches 12 ft 4 in 3.76 m tall. In 1990, The Seattle Times said Soaring Stones' ascending pieces looked as if they were taking off into flight ... ather like Young's career . The sculpture was included in at least one published walking tour of Portland and in another by Whitman College about art on the campus. David Glenn, professor of music at Whitman College, took inspiration from Soaring Stones 4 and other art pieces on the campus for his composition Sculpture Garden for Piano Quintet , a piano quintet commissioned for the opening concert of the 2009 Walla Walla Chamber Music Festival. Glenn based his work on a September 2008 walk through the campus he used Young's sculpture as inspiration for the quintet's final movement. He said of the sculpture's influence Since there are six boulders used in the sculpture, I based this movement in the time signature of 6 4, with a sub division of four and two four on pedestals two on ground . I also used a six note melodic theme that rises six times, descends six times and then rises again six times. The rising and falling represent different perspectives the viewer of the sculpture can haveeither looking from right to left or left to right.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soaring%20Stones
"Sober is a song recorded by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson taken from her third studio album, My December 2007 . The song served as the album's second single on July 10, 2007 through 19 Recordings and RCA Records. Clarkson wrote it after her friend Calamity McEntire, who receives a songwriting credit, gave her the line pick her weeds and keep the flowers , with additional writing by Aben Eubanks and Jimmy Messer, production by David Kahne, and co production by Messer and Jason Halbert. Sober is an alternative rock song, with lyrics that use addiction as a metaphor for a relationship, evolving around the line Three months and I'm still sober . Upon its release, Sober was met with positive reviews from music critics, who considered it to be the musical highlight of My December. Clarkson's vocal performance and song's production received particular praise. Commercially, Sober failed to make an impact, charting at number 93 on Billboard's Pop 100 component chart, based on airplay on mainstream top 40 radio stations and digital downloads, and at number 10 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. No accompanying music video was recorded for the song however, Clarkson promoted it through several live appearances, including at Live Earth and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Clarkson wrote Sober after her friend Calamity McEntire gave her the line pick her weeds and keep the flowers . The singer said the lyrical content is about survival and knowing what to do when something goes wrong. It's not easy getting over whatever your addiction may be, she says. The whole point of that song is, the temptation is there, but I'm not going to give in to it. When asked if the lyrics were regarding a drinking problem, Clarkson responded, I'm not an alcoholic that's not what it's about. It's just a metaphor. Everyone has something they are addicted to that they can do without in their life, so it could be about whatever your addiction is. Sober is an alternative rock ballad that uses addiction as a metaphor for a relationship, and evolves around the line Three months and I'm still sober . The song is composed in the key of D major and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 120 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to F 5. It begins softly, propelled by an acoustic guitar reminiscent of U2's With or Without You 1987 , and takes nearly four minutes to reach its climax layering Kelly's desperate vocals over each other , as noted by Talia Kraines of BBC Music. Clarkson deemed Sober as her favorite song from My December, and commented that musically, almost hypnotic. You just get lost in it, it's just so beautiful. Six weeks after Never Again had been sent to radio, Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that RCA Records pulled from rotations after not catching on. Chuck Taylor of Billboard revealed on June 26, 2007 that Sober would be released as the second single from My December, and commented that the song, compared to Never Again , was a better bet to propel back to . It was officially sent to contemporary hit radio on July 10, 2007, through a promotional CD single including a radio edit and a call out hook. Sober received positive reviews from music critics, with many considering it as one of the album's highlights. Entertainment Weekly editor Chris Willman considered both Never Again and Sober to be moody and warm weather singles. On his review of My December, Josh Love of Stylus Magazine wrote that while album track 'Hole' whips up an almost joyously liberating nihilism that blessedly bypasses goths obfuscation, ... right on its heels there's 'Sober' seething with quiet restraint at least until the end . Boston Globe reporter Sarah Rodman thought Sober was the album's centerpiece, praising it as the set's second best vocal . Sam Lansky of PopCrush considered Sober as Clarkson's 2nd best song, commenting that, even though it had a dismal chart performance, the song still is one of the tracks most beloved by hardcore Clarkson fans. Lansky continued to praise the riveting vocal performance, heartbreaking lyrics, and haunting production that recedes to the background so the singer's incredible voice can shine. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said Sober is a slower burning ballad , while Bill Lamb of About.com considered it one of the top tracks from My December. Two different reviews by staff members of Sputnikmusic praised the song. On the first review, Dave de Sylvia said the song was not radio friendly, but added that it is beautifully arranged, taking in bouncy Sting like synthesised strings and an excellent vocal performance. On the second review, Channing Freeman wrote that Sober is one of the few tracks where Clarkson gets away with her vocal restraint, mainly because at the end she lets loose and gives one of the best performances of her career, making the two or so minutes of waiting worthwhile. Chuck Taylor of Billboard praised Sober as a single that would reintoxicate Clarkson's deserved stance as a staple act . The song failed to make impact, charting at number 93 on Billboard's Pop 100 component chart, based on airplay on mainstream top 40 radio stations and digital downloads. Additionally, it peaked at number 10 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. As of February 11, 2010, Sober has sold 113,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan.

CD DVD release from the Live Earth concerts.

On October 19, 2011, while promoting her fifth studio album Stronger at nightclub The Troubadour, Clarkson performed Sober after it was requested by the fans. Jason Scott of Billboard opined that Clarkson certainly doesn't crash and burn, so to speak instead, she rips into the track until there's nothing left but lyric and heart.

On October 10, 2013, the singer performed the song during a special Fair Trade concert for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.

"Sober is a song recorded by New Zealand singer songwriter Lorde, from her second studio album Melodrama 2017 . Lorde co wrote and co produced the song with Jack Antonoff, with production assistance from Malay and vocal production from Kuk Harrell. It was released on 9 June 2017, by Republic as the album's second promotional single. Sober is the first of a two track song, which is completed by Sober II Melodrama . It is an electronic R B song that features a tiger's roar, trumpets, brass and tenor and baritone saxophones in its production. The lyrics detail the desire to tell someone how you feel about them while wondering how it will be once the liquor wears down. The song received mostly positive reviews from music critics who praised its unexpected direction and departure from the maximalist production of her previous singles Green Light and Perfect Places . It was also compared to the minimalist production on the singer's debut album Pure Heroine 2013 and the works of the xx. The song had minor chart placements in Australia and Canada, placing at 61 and 84, respectively. Lorde performed Sober , with six other songs, as part of a re imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album. It was also part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour 201718 . In a podcast interview with Hrishikesh Hirway's Song Exploder, Lorde described her first summer after her breakup with longtime boyfriend James Lowe as wild and fluorescent as a result, she would often go drinking in her native country of New Zealand and had a strong desire to cope with her heartache. She describes the song as the moment when someone wants to tell a potential lover how they feel about them while knowing the other person feels the same way. However, to approach them, you rely on the party's activities to unfold. The singer revealed that throughout the song, mumbled screams from detached bodies are heard. Lorde's fear of recording on Westlake Recording Studios, which to her was too fancy , resulted in her exhibiting writer's block. She found a small production room, which she called The Rat Nest , to create the song. In a demo, the overall production was initially more moody and emotional . She had specific ideas about Sober and knew how she wanted it to take shape early in the recording process. Jack Antonoff was open to letting Lorde take control of the production. The groove of the song, came after playing a show at Coachella, which was formed using a bongo drum and Lorde singing the words Night, midnight, lose my mind which were subsequently sampled into the track. She compared the preceding vocals to Prince and Michael Jackson. On 7 November 2016, Lorde met with producer Malay in New York City at a session where he underlaid the groove she worked on with Antonoff into the whole song. He took the track's serious minor chords and turned them into insistent party chords. In the session, she also came up with the pause that occurs before the first verse. Kuk Harrell's vocal production helped to intensify the vocals. The horns in the track took inspiration from Hudson Mohawke's production work on TNGHT. She also wanted brass and its horns to sound triumphant, testing out a tenor and baritone saxophone as well as the trumpet. Laura Sisk took control of this during engineering. The sound of a tiger's roar appears before the bridge, which was added two sessions before the song concluded when Antonoff was looking through song samples. According to Antonoff, this was one of his proudest moments when recording Melodrama. Lorde recorded Sober at three different locations in the United States. She began recording at Westlake Recording Studios, in Los Angeles, California, assisted by recording engineer Eric Eylands. Additional recording also took place at Electric Lady Studios, in Greenwich Village, New York with Malay. Recording was completed at Rough Customer Studios, Antonoff's home studio in Brooklyn Heights where he found the tiger's roar sample used in the track. John Hanes mixed the song at MixStar Studios. Laura Sisk served as the engineer for the track. Sober is composed in the key of C major with a moody pop tempo of 110 beats per minute. Lorde's vocals span a range of F3 to D5 and its chord progression follows a basic sequence of FAm G. It is an electronic R B song using bongo drums, trumpets, the tenor and baritone saxophones, brass and a hidden tiger's roar in its production. Rolling Stone writer Jon Blistein described Sober as having rumbling drums and gauzy synths that slowly build to include brash horn stabs that dance around Lorde's vocals. Pitchfork editor Marc Hogan expressed that the song had a spare and slinky electro R B production that kept with much of Pure Heroine 2013 or the xx. Hogan mentioned that stereo panned mini Lordes chirp like angels and devils on her shoulders, with dimly lit spaces and triumphal trumpet blares that make Antonoff's moody three chord foundation seem like plenty . Lauren O'Neill from Noisey described its production as having prominent percussion with horns and an almost hoarse purr of a vocal. The New Yorker's Carrie Battan stated that the lines, I know this story by heart Jack and Jill get fucked up and get possessive when they get dark were about the experience of being too lucid to ever really feel drunk . Dan Weiss from Consequence of Sound compared the same line to the vocal expressions of Prince as well as mentioning the track's sparse array of bending and clicking textures on the production. PopMatters writer Andrew Dorsett also mentioned that the line referenced the imagery of a weekend more euphoric than pills is a little familiar but notes that Lorde looks ahead in the chorus line, What will we do when we're sober . Mike Neid from Idolator stated that the lyrics detail how she drunkenly loses herself in a partner's temporary embrace at a party . O'Neill described Sober as the part where things get a bit intense and your heart starts hurting a bit and you start making out with your ex . Sober received mostly positive reviews from music critics upon release. Several critics compared its minimalist production to Pure Heroine 2013 , a departure from the maximalism of her previous singles Green Light and Perfect Places . Spin writer Andy Cush called the song the strangest track Lorde had released so far. Cush compared the crisp, minimal percussion to her work on Pure Heroine, adding that it had a slyly 2017 twist. He also mentioned that instead of Lorde drawing inspiration from 2000s Atlanta hip hop, she opted for an artful take on the dancehall house hybrid present in modern radio today. The National Public Radio called Sober an stormy epic about risk and regret that's timed perfectly to coincide with the start of an eventful weekend. Rolling Stone described the song as a a sexy midtempo jam endlessly second guessing its own pleasure . The Atlantic called Sober one of the highlights on the record, with writer Spencer Kornhaber stating that the track's Latin shimmying gives way to gothic choruses . Writing for Pitchfork, Marc Hodges called the song transitional , as if it was in motion to somewhere else . He called the production of the track intoxicating and found that her decision to use the same title track as other well known artists was less novel for a performer like herself but that the execution was still tough to deny. PopMatters compared the track to Charli XCX's work on True Romance 2013 . Idolator writer Neid stated that while the song was a bit of a rehash of her previous material, it boasted some of the most finessed productions on the album. Despite several critic's comments over the track's conventionality, it was listed at number one on Stereogum's top five songs of the week list for June 16. Peter from the publication commended the singer and Antonoff for being able to capture the highs and the lows of a night out by crafting a banger that feels both understated and anthemic . DIY also placed Sober in their best tracks of the week list, with Will Richards complementing how wonderfully versatile Lorde has become, and how effortlessly she slips into each guise. Lorde debuted Sober at a tiny pre Coachella gig to a crowd of 240 at Pappy Harriet's on 15 April 2017. This was the first full length concert since July 2014. Before introducing the song, she stated that recording Sober was one of her most favorite things she had ever done. Tickets sold out in minutes. Eve Barlow from Billboard praised the performance, saying that it was heartwarming to watch Lorde engage with such easy confidence on stage, noting her growth in her level of comfort with the crowd. Lorde also performed the song at the Governors Ball on 2 June 2017. During the performance, a tilted box was used, pointing downward. At the end, the box opens and Lorde falls into the arms of her dancers. NME called the performance simple, but delivered with so much poise and finesse, you can't help but be impressed. Lorde performed Sober , with six other songs, as part of a re imagined Vevo series at the Electric Lady Studios where she recorded most of her album and was part of the set list of her Melodrama World Tour 201718 .

Sober is a midtempo synth pop power ballad based around an expansive 1980s influenced song structure the production features chunky percussive beats, hand claps, dark 1980s synthesizers, insistent drums, and synth stabs, along with influences of electro, R B, and pop music. Inspired by social awkwardness after a night of drinking, the track describes a dysfunctional relationship which falls apart due to her lover's complex relationship with alcohol and how it changes their personality. Sober was well received by music critics, many of whom deemed it an album highlight. Praise was given to the track's emotional depth, vocal delivery, and production, while drawing comparisons to the works of Lorde, Tinashe, Sia, and Lana Del Rey. Upon release, Sober peaked on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number 22. Gomez, during an interview with Time For the first time in her career, Gomez was given full creative control following her signing with Interscope Records. She expressed frustration and constraint with the songs chosen for her earlier in her career, and felt a disconnect from the music both personally and professionally. During the creation of Revival, the singer emphasized the importance of creating a distinct sound for herself, telling Nolan Feeney of Time that there were times in my career where I sang things that just werent me and werent for me. You can hear it in my voice. You can hear it when its inauthentic. Gomez aimed to create autobiographical songs which shared personal stories, whether or not she wrote them. Citing the therapeutic process of writing The Heart Wants What It Wants for her greatest hits album For You 2014 , the singer was inspired to separate herself from her peers and convert personal experiences into the music of Revival. For Sober , Gomez focused on using her unique vocal tone and abilities as an actress to translate feelings and emotions through her music. The singer also told producers to focus primarily on the lyrics and vocals, referencing albums of her youth that dealt with themes of growing up in the spotlight, particularly Christina Aguilera's album Stripped 2002 . Being in full creative control, Gomez struggled on several songs including Sober to tell stories that were personal and elegant, yet not over the top . To achieve her desired sound, she chose to work with multiple songwriters, including singer songwriter Chloe Angelides. In an interview with Time, Gomez stated that for her, the track was not inspired by a single person, but instead about her experiences with drinking and social awkwardness, saying I would hang out with people and they would drink and theyre so fun, then the next day it would be weird. Sober was initially conceived during a late night conversation between the singer and Angelides in a hotel hallway, where the pair exchanged their own personal stories on the topic. After Gomez left the hotel, Angelides wrote the lyrics to Sober , and presented it to Gomez the following day. After being shown the initial version of Sober , Gomez brought the song to executive producers Tim Blacksmith and Danny D, who enlisted Norwegian duo Tor Hermansen and Mikkel Eriksen, also known as StarGate, to work on the track. Their work during this time produced several songs for Revival, including Same Old Love and Cologne . Additionally, the lyrics to Sober were slightly modified by frequent collaborators Jacob Kasher Hindlin and Julia Michaels. Gomez worked with Eriksen and Miles Walker to record the song at Westlake Studios in Los Angeles, California, as well as with Mike Anderson at The Hide Out Studios in London, England. Leah Haywood provided additional background vocals. Gomez's vocals were produced by American production team Dreamlab at Westlake, and the engineering was handled by Rob Ellmore with assistance from Daniela Rivera. In its final stages, Sober was mixed by Phil Tan at Ninja Club Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The track was leaked on October 7, 2015, two days before the album's release. Sober was officially released alongside the rest of Revival on October 9, 2015. In a March 2017 interview with Mike Wass of Idolator, Hindlin, a personal friend of Gomez and the song's co writer, revealed that Sober was intended to be the album's fifth single after Kill Em with Kindness . He recounted having a meeting with the singer, where she expressed her readiness to move on from the Revival era and release new music, telling him 'I love you, but I'm ready to put out new stuff'. Sober is a midtempo synthpop power ballad, which incorporates elements of electro, R B and pop into its production. The booming and emotive track features a big, 1980's influenced song structure. Its studded and shimmering production consists of chunky insistent percussive beats, hand claps, and dark 80's influenced synthesizers. The chorus is characterized by catchy shimmering vocal melodies, insistent drums, slamming synth stabs, and girlie yelps. During the intro and outro of Sober , the producers utilize a digitally manipulated, chopped and screwed vocal sample. Lyrically the track is written about a failing relationship caused by a partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks of a man who faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings Why is it so different when we wake up Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough But I know what's next, and I want so much , describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover You've got a hold on me You're like a wasted dream I gave you everything But you don't know how to love me when you're sober . Gomez, on the song's theme of leaving an unhealthy relationship Melissa Haggar of Concrete opined that the song is an intimate reflection on how people can appear so different in certain lights. The song has been compared to the works of Tinashe and Lana Del Rey by Vulture writer Lindsay Zoladz, while Ali Szubiak of PopCrush remarked that Sober takes a page out of Taylor Swifts book . Additionally, Idolator writer Mike Wass compared the song to the music of other relatable pop artists, such as Alessia Cara and Lorde. Katherine St. Asaph of Time magazine noted that Sober was disarmingly peppy and set to the sort of story youd find in an Evanescence single , while Ali Szubiak also called the song's sound deceptively upbeat and noted that Gomez emotes with a newfound ease , allowing her to showcase her vulnerability. In a separate review following the track's leak, Szubiak found that Sober was more intimate in contrast to the sexual nature of other songs on the album such as Good for You and Same Old Love . Upon its release, Sober received positive reviews from music critics, with several declaring it an album highlight. Comparing its production to the works of Australian recording artist Sia, George Griffiths of Redbrick deemed it the best song of Gomez's career praising its placement as the album's musical centerpiece. He elaborated that the themes of empowerment and vulnerability present throughout Revival coalesced into Sober more clearly and coherently than you could ever have imagined . In her review, Concrete writer Melissa Haggar called Sober a key example of the personal and meaningful lyrics behind Revival, calling the track somber and satisfying . Haggar went on to say that the singer reflects similar melancholy emotions in bonus tracks like the bittersweet ballad 'Nobody' and the sweeping 'Cologne', which display her more vulnerable side. Idolator writer Mike Wass felt that the track was among the album's best tracks, and compared it to Alessia Cara's single Here from her debut album Know It All 2015 and Lorde's debut album Pure Heroine 2013 , saying With the rise of relatable pop, this bittersweet pop anthem should get a warm reception at radio. Emo posturing doesnt get any catchier. Vulture writer Lindsay Zoladz called Sober a standout, suggesting that it receive the single treatment or better yet turned into a he said she said mash up with the Weeknd's 'The Hills'. Katherine St. Asaph of Time noted that although the middle section of most albums tend to be filler, on Revival it contains the standout tracks, including Sober . Writing for Entertainment Focus, Pip Ellwood Hughes noted that the song contained the best vocals on the album, declaring it as a standout track along with Kill Em With Kindness , Hands to Myself , and Good for You . Ali Szubiak of PopCrush was pleased that the singer followed through on her statement to make more personal music, and declared that Sober deserved to be released as a single. Writing for 411Mania, David Hayter stated that while not as original as Same Old Love , Gomez's restraint and ability to carry a chorus allowed the song to give a narrative depth to Revival. Hayter gave specific praise to the lyrics, which in his opinion add a sorrowful context to Good For You and a sense of triumph to the freedom and independence of Me The Rhythm . Following its release, multiple critics found that the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about one specific person . During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained the meaning of the album track by track, saying that Sober was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that you have to go through everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way. In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that as soon as heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure Camouflage is Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying Were sure theres some weight to that, but we cant help but think theres some hints of Justin Bieber in this track.

"Garfield Sobers, captain of the West Indies cricket team and one of the most prominent cricketers in the world, outraged many in the Caribbean in September 1970 when he took part in a friendly double wicket tournament at Salisbury Sports Club in Rhodesia renamed Zimbabwe in 1980 , a country in southern Africa that was unrecognised internationally because of its mostly white minority government. The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened the unity of the West Indies team itself. Sobers was captain of the Rest of the World team that toured England between May and August 1970 in place of the South Africa national team, whose proposed tour had been cancelled by English cricketing authorities because of apartheid. He accepted an invitation to the Rhodesian competition from Eddie Barlow, a South African member of the Rest of the World team, and arrived in Salisbury on the day of the event. To ecstatic applause from the mostly white spectators, Sobers partnered South African Test captain Ali Bacher in the tournament, and said afterwards that he had enjoyed himself, though he and Bacher had not won. Having established a personal rapport with the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, Sobers left the next day and returned home to Barbados. Many in the West Indies were appalled by Sobers' actions, and when he subsequently made positive comments about Smith, Rhodesia and white South African cricketers in press interviews and announced his intention to play more cricket in Rhodesia, the vitriol intensified, with one Antiguan newspaper branding him a white black man . A number of prominent figures, including entire political parties, called for Sobers to be stripped of the West Indies cricket captaincy. Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham barred Sobers from Guyana, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India announced that if Sobers remained in the team, India would pull out of its upcoming tour of the West Indies. Sobers argued that as a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician , he had done nothing wrong. The West Indies Cricket Board WICB contemplated whether it would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s. Garfield Sobers, from the Caribbean island of Barbados, was widely regarded as one of the world's finest cricketers from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and is placed by many among the best to ever play the sport. An all rounder, he made his debut for the West Indies cricket team, the multinational side representing the Caribbean in international cricket, at the age of 17 in 1954. He was a regular member of the team for the next two decades. Sobers set a then world record highest individual score of 365 runs not out during a Test match against Pakistan in 1958, and became captain of the West Indies team six years later. In domestic first class cricket, he was one of the first West Indians to play abroad, representing South Australia and Nottinghamshire during the 1960s and 1970s. His batting, bowling and fielding were all regarded as excellent by contemporaries, but his decision making and tactics were occasionally criticised. Rhodesia was an unrecognised state in southern Africa, run by a predominantly white minority government headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith. Taking exception to the UK's insistence on a set timetable for majority rule as a condition for independence, Smith's colonial administration had unilaterally declared independence in 1965 following a long dispute over the terms. International uproar and the first ever United Nations economic sanctions had ensued, making Rhodesia deeply isolated. This quarantine variously extended to sports. Rhodesian athletes, including the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympic squads which were racially integrated , were barred from international competition on political grounds. Rhodesian cricket and rugby were not greatly affected as these sports largely operated in tandem with South Africa. The Rhodesia cricket team, for example, took part in the annual Currie Cup tournament against South African provincial sides. As world opinion hardened against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes. Until 1976, non whites were legally barred from the South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads. The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club which then governed English cricket called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board TCCB at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991. The TCCB sought to recoup the lost revenues for the 1970 season by hastily organising a replacement series of matches between England and a Rest of the World team comprising leading cricketers from around the world. This squad, described by the leading cricket publication Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as one of the strongest teams ever to take the field , included five South Africans, five West Indians including Sobers, as captain , two Pakistanis and a player each from Australia and India. It defeated England 41 over a tour lasting from late June to late August 1970. Eddie Barlow, one of the South African members of the Rest of the World team, suggested to Sobers towards the end of the English series that the West Indian might like to take part in a friendly double wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event. Sobers was enthusiastically received in Salisbury by blacks and whites alike he described the reception and hospitality as wonderful and just great . After a few hours' rest, he made his way to Salisbury Sports Club for the competition, in which he partnered the South African Test captain Ali Bacher, whom he had never met. Sobers received 600 for appearing. The largely white capacity crowd gave the Barbadian a hero's welcome, accompanying his walk out to the wicket with a standing ovation and a chorus of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow . Having flown in just that morning, Sobers underperformed, and he and Bacher did not win. All the same, the other teams formed a guard of honour for them as they left the field. Bacher found Sobers be a great guy with no airs or graces he suggested to his teammate that he should consider also playing in South Africa. Sobers spent part of the day sitting with Ian Smith in the stands. Both reported enjoying the occasion Smith, a keen sports fan and a talented player in his day, fondly recounted his lovely day discussing the great men of cricket with Sobers in his memoirs, while Sobers recalled the Rhodesian premier as a tremendous person to talk to . After the tournament ended, they continued their conversation over dinner. Smith told Sobers that he was welcome to come back to Rhodesia whenever he liked. Sobers left the next day, after less than 48 hours in the country, and returned home to Barbados on 15 September 1970. Sobers was met in Bridgetown by an enormous and hostile press storm. To say there was an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place, the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as a white black man and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular . Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he may not be welcomed anywhere by people who believe that justice is bigger than even sport . Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had never been bothered about criticism, and I do not see why I should start now . Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' calm dignity in response to the primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians . Sobers told the media that he had played in Rhodesia as he felt it would be good for cricket, particularly after the cancellation of the South African tour of England, and that politics had not entered his mind. He told interviewers that he had had no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that he probably would not do so I don't know if I would want to get involved in that, he said, but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed. Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team, and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players. He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician, he said. I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should affect my position as captain of the West Indies team. The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham announced that Sobers would not be allowed to enter Guyana until he apologised. This was a major issue for the West Indies Cricket Board WICB as the team played at least one Test match a year in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital. The Jamaica Labour Party called for Sobers to resign as captain four days later Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, then announced that if Sobers were not removed from the West Indies team, India would cancel its upcoming tour of the West Indies, scheduled for early 1971. The WICB considered its options. Cancelling matches in Guyana might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking Sobers might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened. Meanwhile, no sign of an apology emanated from Sobers. Taking matters into his own hands, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Eric Williams wrote an apology letter for Sobers to sign, addressed to WICB president Noel Pierce, and had it delivered to the West Indies captain by the Barbadian fast bowler Wes Hall. The letter explained that Sobers had not known of the deep feelings of the West Indian people on Rhodesia, that he now better understood the political issues, and that he would not go to the southern African country again. I therefore wish to convey to you and the members of the board my sincere regrets for any embarrassment which my action may have caused, and to assure you of my unqualified dedication whenever I may be called upon to represent my countrythe West Indiesand my people, it concluded. Sobers signed, and the apology was promptly conveyed to the WICB in late October 1970, with copies also going to the council of the West Indies Associated States and the prime ministerial offices of Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. A grateful Caribbean grabbed the apology with both hands, Manley records The thought that might be lost as a consequence of a political gaffe was intolerable. For the great majority, the incident was forgiven and promptly forgotten. Sobers regained his former popularity and kept the West Indies cricket captaincy until 1972 he retired from the sport two years later. He was subsequently knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975 for his services to cricket, and named one of the ten National Heroes of Barbados by the Barbadian government in 1998. His controversial visit to Rhodesia has been described by cricket journalist Siddhartha Vaidyanathan as precursoring the West Indian rebel tours affair of the early 1980s, in which black cricketers from the Caribbean broke the apartheid sporting boycott and played in South Africa. The West Indian rebel players became wildly popular among South African cricket fans, but were punished at home with bans from all organised cricket initially for life, but lifted in 1989 , compounded by lasting social and professional ostracism. Sobers retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport, and was reluctant to criticise the West Indians who toured South Africa. All the same, he came to regret having gone to Rhodesia because of the scandal he had provoked. Had I known the furore my visit was to cause, he later said, I would not have gone.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury%20Sports%20Club%20tournament%20in%201970
"Marek Sobieski 24 May 1628 3 June 1652 was a Polish nobleman, starosta tenant of the Crown lands of Krasnystaw and Jaworow, and the older brother of King John III Sobieski of Poland. He graduated from Nowodworek College in Krakow and Krakow Academy, then traveled and studied in Western Europe. After returning to Poland in 1648 he fought against the Cossacks and Tatars at the Siege of Zbaraz and at the Battle of Beresteczko. He was taken captive by Tatars in 1652 and then killed by Cossacks. Sobieski was the oldest child of Jakub Sobieski and his second wife Teofila Zofia Daniowicz. He was born on 24 May 1628 in Zoczow and spent his childhood in Zokiew. He grew up in a patriotic family, and his mother often took him and his brother to the grave of her grandfather Stanisaw Zokiewski, Grand Hetman of the Crown, who was killed in the battle of Cecora in 1620. Zofia Teofila Daniowicz taught her sons the inscription upon their great grandfather's grave O quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori How sweet and glorious it is to die for one's homeland . On 29 October 1639 Sobieski became Starosta of Jaworow. Along with his brother John, beginning in 1640, Sobieski studied at the Nowodworski College in Krakow. On 29 April 1642 Sobieski made a speech on funeral of Jakub Zadzik, bishop of Krakow. The next year, on 2 June 1643, Sobieski made a speech where he thanked absent Wadysaw IV for everything he had done for Nodworski College. Two months earlier, in April 1643, Marek and John Sobieski began studies at Krakow Academy. In 1644 Sobieski became Starosta of Krasnystaw. In 1645 Jakub Sobieski, father of Marek and John, prepared special instructions and a guidebook for his sons, who were about to go abroad. Jakub Sobieski, who was inspired by Roman authors, emphasized learning foreign languages and physical exercises. He wanted to prepare his sons to be politics and diplomats. After completing their studies in 1646, the brothers started to travel around Europe under the tutelage of Sebastian Gawrecki. They departed Zokiew on 21 February or 25 March 1646. They visited Berlin, Wittenberg, Leipzig, Halle, Amsterdam and Paris, where they arrived on 9 June 1646. They spent the next 16 months in France. In October 1647 Marek and John Sobieski went to England and subsequently studied mathematics in the Netherlands. The brothers had planned to go to Turkey, but after hearing of the Khmelnytsky uprising they decided to return to Poland. Marek and John Sobieski left Brussels on 24 July 1648. After returning to Poland, Sobieski and his brother came to Zamosc, which at the time was being besieged by Cossacks. In 1648, 1649 and 1650 Sobieski was elected a member of the parliament sejm walny of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. In 1649 he was among the electors who voted for John II Casimir as King of Poland. Then, as a head of a choragiew husarska military unit formed by Hussars of 100 horse, the young starosta joined the army of Jeremi Wisniowiecki. Sobieski was a member of the Polish defense crew besieged by Cossacks at Zbaraz from 10 July to 22 August 1649. In 1650 he fought against the Cossacks at Kamieniec Podolski. Marek Sobieski also took part in the Battle of Beresteczko on 2830 June 1651. After the Polish victory, due his bravery, he received a saber of Tugay Bey, who had been killed during the battle. In September 1651 he fought at the Battle of Biaa Cerkiew. When the Poles, Cossacks and Tatars began negotiations, Marek Sobieski was sent to the Cossack camp as a guarantor of safety for the Cossack leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, who was in the Polish camp. In 1652 Sobieski fought against the Cossacks near Bracaw and during Biaa Cerkiew campaign. Marching with Jan Odrzywolski, but without his own hussar banner, Sobieski and his retinue came to the field hetman Kalinowski's camp at Batoh on May 31. Marek Sobieski and Odrzywolski were assigned to command cavalry banners during the subsequent battle, and in that capacity they fought on June 1 and 2. On June 2, during the second day of the Battle of Batoh after the defeat of Polish cavalry in the field before the Polish camp, Sobieski commanded a cavalry group, perhaps containing wounded filed hetman Kalinowski, that withdrew to the eastern redoubt in Polish camp, where Cossacks destroyed them after bringing artillery. Following Polish soldier Wespazjan Kochowski's writings Sobieski might have been the last Polish commander defending the Polish camp against the Cossack Tatar army. Young commander was taken prisoner or surrendered, to be ransomed in a future as it was practice of the day, by the Tatars or Cossacks. After the battle, the Cossacks paid the Tatars for possession of the prisoners, and killed the Polish captives in retaliation for Chmielnicki's defeat at Berestechko. Among the 8,000 massacred Polish soldiers was Marek Sobieski. or the number could have been much higher, up to 15,000 killed in action and massacred. Sobieski's mother returned his body home, and to commemorate her fallen son she founded the Church of the Assumption of Mary in Zokiew, which was built between 1653 and 1655. Sobieski was buried there in 1655 on the day the church was consecrated. His brother, King John III Sobieski, commissioned a gravestone by Andreas Schluter made from black marble, which was destroyed after 1945. In 1946 Sobieski's body was taken to the Dominican Holy Trinity Church in Krakow. Sobieski was portrayed by Henryk Sienkiewicz in With Fire and Sword 1884 , Antoni Euzebiusz Balicki in Z zaka krol 1936 and Jacek Komuda in novel Bohun 2006 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%20Sobieski%20%281628%E2%80%931652%29
"A soccer kick, also known as a soccer ball kick or PK penalty kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, and as tiro de meta in vale tudo, is a reference to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them. A soccer kick is performed when a fighter is standing to the side or in front of an opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks to other parts of the body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks. Dr. Johnny Benjamin stated his belief that soccer kicks could cause serious injury, based on the assumption that an MMA fighter would be able to generate the same amount of force in a soccer kick as a professional association football player. Some MMA fans argue that no one has ever been seriously injured from a soccer kick and stated that there were already equally dangerous moves allowed in MMA. Dr. Johnny Benjamin argued that soccer kicks could result in broken necks and paralysis if performed with the wrong positioning and high velocity. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were written with the intention of making the sport of MMA appear more acceptable in a wider society. Under those rules, soccer kicks were explicitly banned and classed as a foul defined as kicking the head of a grounded opponent . It is noted that while soccer kicks to grounded opponents are fouls, axe kicks, downward strikes with the back of the heel, are not considered fouls if done to any part of a grounded opponent. In the years after the banning of soccer kicks under the Unified Rules, a number of fans and MMA fighters have argued for them to be permitted under the Unified Rules along with face and foot stomps. Their justification is that soccer kicks and stomps being disallowed hindered fighters who were used to using them under other MMA rule sets. Mauricio Rua, who mostly used soccer kicks to earn victories in Pride, argued that elbows caused more pain than soccer kicks and claimed that soccer kicks were safer than elbows. Rua also argued that elbows were more dangerous than soccer kicks and yet were allowed under the unified rules. Opponents of soccer kicks argued that they needed to be banned in order for the sport of MMA to move forward. They also argued that in the face of opposition to the sport from politicians such as John McCain, soccer kicks had to be banned in order to ensure that the sport was not viewed as illegal human cockfighting and could be sanctioned as legal in the United States by Athletic Commissions. Although a soccer kick is a foul when delivered to the head in the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts which prevail in North America, the technique was commonly employed in Pride Fighting Championships in Japan. Fighters Wanderlei Silva and Mauricio Rua were notable practitioners of the soccer kick in MMA. Under the Unified Rules, some MMA fighters attempted to use tactics with the kicking the head of a grounded opponent rule, which defined a fighter as grounded if they had any part of their body apart from their feet on the ground. This meant that fighters, such as Jon Jones, would often try to provoke illegal soccer kicks by putting their hand on the ground or as a way to avoid strikes such as the soccer kick after a failed takedown. However, in 2013, referees were encouraged to interpret the rules that if a fighter is deliberately intending to provoke an illegal soccer kick and one was used, then the referee could decide that it was a legal move. There are still MMA organizations such as Singapore based ONE Fighting Championship and Japanese based Rizin Fighting Federation that allow soccer kicks to the head of downed opponent. ONE Fighting Championship previously had an open attack rule, which required fighters to get permission from the referee to use soccer kicks. In 2012, the company changed its rule set to the rules used by Pride Fighting Championship allowing fighters to use soccer kicks without asking for permission from the referee. In professional wrestling, some wrestlers use the soccer kick is as a finishing move. A number of professional wrestlers prior to the 1980s professional wrestling boom were taught to use wrestling moves and strikes legitimately. This was due to the likelihood of attacks on the wrestlers from fans. This included the soccer kick, which former pro wrestler, CM Punk stated was the easiest tactic to use when a fan tried to get in the ring to confront a wrestler. High profile users of soccer kicks as a finishing move includes Katsuyori Shibata, and Randy Orton. In Japan within a 1977 puroresu match between Antonio Inoki and Great Antonio, Inoki started to shoot on Great Antonio after Great Antonio refused to sell Inoki's offence. Inoki used a takedown on Great Antonio and then used soccer kicks and head stomps to legitimately knock out Great Antonio. In the 2010 video game, EA Sports MMA, soccer kicks were included in the game. In the 2012 video game UFC Undisputed 3, soccer kicks are included in the game in the Pride mode. This mode was intended to replicate Pride Fighting Championships. This was different compared with the normal UFC mode which does not include soccer kicks due to UFC following the Unified Rules. The soccer kick has also been used in professional wrestling video games. It was used in the 1999 Nintendo 64 game, WWF WrestleMania 2000.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer%20kick
"The Social Credit Board was a committee in Alberta, Canada from 1937 until 1948. Composed of Social Credit backbenchers in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, it was created in the aftermath of the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt. Its mandate was to oversee the implementation of social credit in Alberta. To this end, it secured the services of L. Dennis Byrne and George Powell, two lieutenants of social credit's British founder, C. H. Douglas. After requiring all Social Credit Members of the Legislative Assembly MLAs to sign loyalty oaths to it, the Social Credit Board proceeded to recommend radical legislation regulating banking, taxing banks, and restricting freedom of the press and access to courts. Most of this legislation was either disallowed by the federal government or ruled ultra vires beyond the powers of the province by the Supreme Court of Canada these defeats and the advent of World War II made the Social Credit Board increasingly irrelevant. In its later years it became highly anti Semitic, and it was dissolved by the government of Ernest Manning in 1948. William Aberhart's Social Credit League won the 1935 Alberta general election on a platform of ending the Great Depression by implementing social credit, a new economic theory that posited that poverty could be ended by increasing citizens' purchasing power. By 1937, many Social Credit backbenchers in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta were becoming frustrated with the government's lack of progress. This frustration became the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt. As a condition of regaining the rebels' support, Aberhart agreed to create the Social Credit Board, to be composed of five Social Credit MLAs and responsible for the implementation of social credit in Alberta. The chair of the Social Credit Board was Glenville MacLachlan he and three other members had been insurgents during the revolt, while the fifth member, Floyd Baker, had remained loyal to Aberhart. The Social Credit Board was tasked with the appointment of a Social Credit commission, composed of experts on social credit, to advise on the implementation of social credit in Alberta. Most Social Crediters hoped that C. H. Douglas, the British founder of the social credit movement, would agree to head this commission. Douglas refused MacLachlan's entreaties to do so, but sent two representatives, George Frederick Powell and L. Dennis Byrne, in his stead. One of Powell's first acts was to demand that all Social Credit MLAs sign an oath of loyalty to the Social Credit Board, which almost all did. The first round of legislation recommended by the commission and subsequently passed by the legislature included the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, which required every bank and all their employees to be licensed by the provincial government and to be overseen by a Social Credit Board appointed directorate, the Bank Employees Civil Rights Act, which prohibited unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating legal proceedings, and amendments to the Judicature Act prohibiting court actions alleging that any of Alberta's legislation was unconstitutional. Lieutenant Governor of Alberta John Campbell Bowen, asked to give royal assent to these bills, asked Attorney General John Hugill if he considered them to be valid under the Canadian constitution. Hugill responded in the negative and, after being asked to do so by Aberhart, resigned. Aberhart appointed himself Attorney General and told Bowen that it was his opinion that the laws were constitutional. Bowen provided royal assent, but all three acts were subsequently disallowed by the federal government. In 1937's Bankers' Toadies incident, Powell along with Social Credit whip Joe Unwin was convicted of criminal libel, sentenced to six months hard labour, and deported to the United Kingdom. The charges stemmed from a pamphlet listing nine men as bankers' toadies and advocating their extermination . The Social Credit Board's second round of bills included a rewritten version of the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act. The previous version had been disallowed partly on the basis that, under the British North America Act, 1867, banking was a responsibility of the federal government, and the government of Alberta therefore lacked the authority to regulate it. In an attempt to address this concern, the new version substituted the words credit institutions for banks . The Social Credit Board's proposals also included the Bank Taxation Act, which imposed extremely high taxes on banks operating in Alberta, and the Accurate News and Information Act, which severely restricted freedom of the press. All of these bills were passed by the legislature. Bowen, not wishing to have more laws to which he had assented disallowed, reserved assent from all three until the Supreme Court of Canada could comment on their constitutional validity. It did so in 1938's Reference re Alberta Statutes, which found all three to be unconstitutional. The Social Credit Board's major initiatives had failed. World War II further reduced the Social Credit Board's importance, as implementation of social credit took a backseat to the war effort. Instead of proposing new policy, the board devoted itself to propaganda its members spoke across the province about social credit, and it distributed vast numbers of pamphlets and leaflets 272,900 in 1939 . When Aberhart died in 1943, he was replaced by Ernest Manning, who was by this time considerably less open to radical social credit proposals than Aberhart had been. He soon transferred many of the Social Credit Board's responsibilities to the new department of Economic Affairs, of which L. D. Byrne was the deputy minister. Byrne, the remaining Douglas lieutenant after Powell's deportation, shared both Douglas's economic theories and his antisemitism. Under his influence, the Social Credit Board began to propagate anti Jewish conspiracy theories, including those espoused by the Russian forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Its 1943 report alleged a plot, world wide in scope, deliberately engineered by a small number of ruthless international financiers , most of whom were Jewish. Its 1947 report repeated these allegations, and also proposed a new voting system in which voters would state their choices publicly, and be taxed only for those government programs they supported during the election. Political parties were to be abolished in favour of leagues of electors , and all farmland was to be appropriated by the government. Manning, benignly neglectful of the Social Credit Board to this point, took this as a direct challenge to his leadership, a shot across the bow . He quickly introduced a resolution in the legislature to condemn, repudiate, and completely dissociate the legislature from any statements or publications which are incompatible with the established British ideals of democratic freedom, or which endorse, excuse, or incite anti Semitism or racial or religious intolerance in any form . In November 1947 he announced that the Social Credit Board would cease to exist effective March 1948, and in February 1948 he asked for and received Byrne's resignation as deputy minister of Economic Affairs. Despite its beginnings as a vehicle of intended economic revolution, the board achieved nothing of lasting importance. Once its early efforts were foiled by the federal government and the courts, it ceased to have much influence. By 1948, the dire conditions that had sparked Albertans' enthusiasm for radical economic reform had vanished, and with it their interest in social credit. While the Social Crediters remained in government until 1971, the revolutionary spirit of the 1930s was all but forgotten as Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel notes, post war Social Credit had been transformed from a mass, eclectic movement for social reform led by monetary reformers to a relatively small government party that enjoyed considerable support from various sectors of the Alberta population for its judicious combination of right wing rhetoric and social service and road building programs. The Social Credit Board, with its reform mandate and its direct pipeline to Douglas, was no longer needed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%20Credit%20Board
"Social identity is the portion of an individual's self concept derived from perceived membership in a relevant social group. As originally formulated by social psychologists Henri Tajfel and John Turner in the 1970s and the 1980s, social identity theory introduced the concept of a social identity as a way in which to explain intergroup behaviour. Social identity theory is described as a theory that predicts certain intergroup behaviours on the basis of perceived group status differences, the perceived legitimacy and stability of those status differences, and the perceived ability to move from one group to another. This contrasts with occasions where the term social identity theory is used to refer to general theorizing about human social selves. Moreover, and although some researchers have treated it as such, social identity theory was never intended to be a general theory of social categorization. It was awareness of the limited scope of social identity theory that led John Turner and colleagues to develop a cousin theory in the form of self categorization theory, which built on the insights of social identity theory to produce a more general account of self and group processes. The term social identity approach, or social identity perspective, is suggested for describing the joint contributions of both social identity theory and self categorization theory. Social identity theory suggests that an organization can change individual behaviors if it can modify their self identity or part of their self concept that derives from the knowledge of, and emotional attachment to the group. Social identity theory states that social behavior will want a person to change his her behavior while in a group. It varies along a continuum between interpersonal behavior and intergroup behaviour. Completely interpersonal behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the individual characteristics and interpersonal relationships that exists between only two people. Completely intergroup behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the social category memberships that apply to more than two people. The authors of social identity theory state that purely interpersonal or purely intergroup behaviour is unlikely to be found in realistic social situations. Rather, behaviour is expected to be driven by a compromise between the two extremes. The cognitive nature of personal vs. social identities, and the relationship between them, is more fully developed in self categorization theory. Social identity theory instead focuses on the social structural factors that will predict which end of the spectrum will most influence an individual's behaviour, along with the forms that that behavior may take. A key assumption in social identity theory is that individuals are intrinsically motivated to achieve positive distinctiveness. That is, individuals strive for a positive self concept . As individuals to varying degrees may be defined and informed by their respective social identities as per the interpersonal intergroup continuum it is further derived in social identity theory that individuals strive to achieve or to maintain positive social identity . The precise nature of this strive for positive self concept is a matter of debate see the self esteem hypothesis . Both the interpersonal intergroup continuum and the assumption of positive distinctiveness motivation arose as outcomes of the findings of minimal group studies. In particular, it was found that under certain conditions individuals would endorse resource distributions that would maximize the positive distinctiveness of an ingroup in contrast to an outgroup at the expense of personal self interest. Building on the above components, social identity theory details a variety of strategies that may be invoked in order to achieve positive distinctiveness. The individual's choice of behaviour is posited to be dictated largely by the perceived intergroup relationship. In particular the choice of strategy is an outcome of the perceived permeability of group boundaries e.g., whether a group member may pass from a low status group into a high status group , as well as the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy. The self enhancing strategies detailed in social identity theory are detailed below. Importantly, although these are viewed from the perspective of a low status group member, comparable behaviours may also be adopted by high status group members. It is predicted that under conditions where the group boundaries are considered permeable individuals are more likely to engage in individual mobility strategies. That is, individuals disassociate from the group and pursue individual goals designed to improve their personal lot rather than that of their ingroup . Where group boundaries are considered impermeable, and where status relations are considered reasonably stable, individuals are predicted to engage in social creativity behaviours. Here, low status ingroup members are still able to increase their positive distinctiveness without necessarily changing the objective resources of the ingroup or the outgroup. This may be achieved by comparing the ingroup to the outgroup on some new dimension, changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, and choosing an alternative outgroup by which to compare the ingroup. Here an ingroup seeks positive distinctiveness via direct competition with the outgroup in the form of ingroup favoritism. It is considered competitive in that in this case favoritism for the ingroup occurs on a value dimension that is shared by all relevant social groups in contrast to social creativity scenarios . Social competition is predicted to occur when group boundaries are considered impermeable, and when status relations are considered to be reasonably unstable. Although not privileged in the theory, it is this positive distinctiveness strategy that has received the greatest amount of attention. The term 'social identity theory' achieved academic currency only in the late 1970s, but the basic underlying concepts associated with it had emerged by the early twentieth century. William G. Sumner, writing in 1906, captures the primary dynamics in this excerpt from his influential work Folkways A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals By the late 1920s the collectivist perspective had all but disappeared from mainstream social psychology. Over fifty years later, around the time of the first formal use of the term 'social identity theory', Tajfel wrote this on the state of social psychology Thus, social identity theory in part reflects a desire to reestablish a more collectivist approach to social psychology of the self and social groups. In group favoritism also known as ingroup bias , despite Turner's objections to the term is an effect where people give preferential treatment to others when they are perceived to be in the same ingroup. Social identity attributes the cause of ingroup favoritism to a psychological need for positive distinctiveness and describes the situations where ingroup favoritism is likely to occur as a function of perceived group status, legitimacy, stability, and permeability . It has been shown via the minimal group studies that ingroup favoritism may occur for both arbitrary ingroups e.g. a coin toss may split participants into a 'heads' group and a 'tails' group as well as non arbitrary ingroups e.g. ingroups based on cultures, genders, sexual orientation, and first languages . Continued study into the relationship between social categorization and ingroup favoritism has explored the relative prevalences of the ingroup favoritism vs. outgroup discrimination, explored different manifestations of ingroup favoritism, and has explored the relationship between ingroup favoritism and other psychological constraints e.g., existential threat . Social identities are a valued aspect of the self, and people will sacrifice their pecuniary self interest to maintain the self perception that they belong to a given social group. Political partisans and fans of sports teams e.g., Republicans and Democrats, or MLB, NFL, NCAA fans are reluctant to bet against the success of their party or team because of the diagnostic cost such a bet would incur to their identification with it. As a result, partisans and fans will reject even very favorable bets against identity relevant desired outcomes. More than 45 of N.C.A.A. basketball and hockey fans, for example, turned down a free, real chance to earn 5 if their team lost its upcoming game. Social identity theory proposes that people are motivated to achieve and maintain positive concepts of themselves. Some researchers, including Michael Hogg and Dominic Abrams, thus propose a fairly direct relationship between positive social identity and self esteem. In what has become known as the self esteem hypothesis , self esteem is predicted to relate to in group bias in two ways. Firstly, successful intergroup discrimination elevates self esteem. Secondly, depressed or threatened self esteem promotes intergroup discrimination. Empirical support for these predictions has been mixed. Some social identity theorists, including John Turner, consider the self esteem hypothesis as not canonical to social identity theory. In fact, the self esteem hypothesis is argued to be conflictual with the tenets of the theory. It is argued that the self esteem hypothesis misunderstands the distinction between a social identity and a personal identity. Along those lines, John Turner and Penny Oakes argue against an interpretation of positive distinctiveness as a straightforward need for self esteem or quasi biological drive toward prejudice . They instead favour a somewhat more complex conception of positive self concept as a reflection of the ideologies and social values of the perceiver. Additionally, it is argued that the self esteem hypothesis neglects the alternative strategies to maintaining a positive self concept that are articulated in social identity theory i.e., individual mobility and social creativity . In what has been dubbed the Positive Negative Asymmetry Phenomenon, researchers have shown that punishing the out group benefits self esteem less than rewarding the in group. From this finding it has been extrapolated that social identity theory is therefore unable to deal with bias on negative dimensions. Social identity theorists, however, point out that for ingroup favouritism to occur a social identity must be psychologically salient , and that negative dimensions may be experienced as a less fitting basis for self definition . This important qualification is subtly present in social identity theory, but is further developed in self categorization theory. Empirical support for this perspective exist. It has been shown that when experiment participants can self select negative dimensions that define the ingroup no positivenegative asymmetry is found. It has been posited that social identity theory suggests that similar groups should have an increased motivation to differentiate themselves from each other. Subsequently, empirical findings where similar groups are shown to possess increased levels of intergroup attraction and decreased levels of in group bias have been interpreted as problematic for the theory. Elsewhere it has been suggested that this apparent inconsistency may be resolved by attending to social identity theory's emphasis on the importance of the perceived stability and legitimacy of the intergroup status hierarchy. Social identity theory has been criticised for having far greater explanatory power than predictive power. That is, while the relationship between independent variables and the resulting intergroup behaviour may be consistent with the theory in retrospect, that particular outcome is often not that which was predicted at the outset. A rebuttal to this charge is that the theory was never advertised as the definitive answer to understanding intergroup relationships. Instead it is stated that social identity theory must go hand in hand with sufficient understanding of the specific social context under consideration. The latter argument is consistent with the explicit importance that the authors of social identity theory placed on the role of objective factors, stating that in any particular situation the effects of variables are powerfully determined by the previous social, economic, and political processes . Some researchers interpret social identity theory as drawing a direct link between identification with a social group and ingroup favoritism. For example, Charles Stangor and John Jost state that a main premise of social identity theory is that ingroup members will favour their own group over other groups . This interpretation is rejected by other researchers. For example, Alex Haslam states that although vulgarized versions of social identity theory argue that 'social identification leads automatically to discrimination and bias', in fact...discrimination and conflict are anticipated only in a limited set of circumstances . The likening of social identity theory with social competition and ingroup favouritism is partly attributable to the fact that early statements of the theory included empirical examples of ingroup favouritism, while alternative positive distinctiveness strategies e.g., social creativity were at that stage theoretical assertions. Regardless, in some circles the prediction of a straightforward identification bias correlation has earned the pejorative title social identity theory lite .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%20identity%20theory
"A social thriller is a film genre using elements of suspense and horror to augment instances of oppression in society. The genre gained notoriety in 2017 with the release of Jordan Peele's Get Out, a film highlighting instances of racial alienation, which veil a plot to abduct young African Americans. Prior to Peele, other film actors, directors and critics had used the term to describe an emerging genre of cinema with examples from all over the globe. Many social thrillers focus on issues of race, class, gender, sexuality or nationhood, often within the format of genre films more broadly categorized as film noir, drama, horror cinema, or Bollywood musicals, among others. Social thriller first appeared in film criticism to denote films using elements of suspense to heighten dramatic tension caused by social inequity. Often appearing in quotes, the term was being used as early as the 1970s to retrospectively describe political neo noir cinema. An early example comes from cinema writer Georges Sadoul's characterization of El Wahsh The Monster , an Egyptian crime film entered into the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. Sadoul sums up the film as a social thriller based on an authentic police case about police pursuit of a drug addicted gangster. Sadoul goes on to describe the film's documentary style and backdrop of life in the Egyptian countryside. Other early uses of the term can be found in descriptions of French New Wave films, such as The Nada Gang, Claude Chabrol's 1974 film inspired by the May 1968 events in France. In their book, French Culture Since 1945, Malcolm and Martin Cook wrote that Chabrol's career has been almost exclusively devoted to what might be called the 'social thriller' and go on to define the genre as, films using a suspense format often akin to that of Hitchcock to comment on the deviousness and duplicity of French society. Many other film critics bandied about the term in their reviews prior to the 2010s but seldom in a way that gave the social thriller its own status as a codified genre in cinema. Prior to 2017, most writers used the term only once, usually in a single review, and to characterize an individual film. In his biography on William Wyler, Axel Madsen calls the 1937 Humphrey Bogart picture Dead End a social thriller. TLA Video reviewer David Bleiler described the 1950 Sidney Poitier film No Way Out as an exceptionally made, tense drama which succeeds both as medical soap opera and social thriller. Douglas Brode called Spencer Tracy the alienated anti hero of the social thriller for his 1955 performance in Bad Day at Black Rock. Another Poitier film, 1967's In the Heat of the Night, got tagged as social thriller by Leonard Maltin, and was also cited as such on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Both Tracy and Poitier also appeared in 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a film that would later be identified as a key non thriller example of the social thriller genre. For films produced outside the U.S., more than one reviewer has named the 1961 British film Victim as a social thriller. As the first English language film on record to use the word homosexual in its dialogue, Victim raised controversy in the United Kingdom for its critique of Britain's anti gay laws that would remain in place until the passing of Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalized homosexuality for men in England and Wales. Ismal Xavier called the 1962 Brazilian political train robbery film O Assalto ao Trem Pagador Assault on the Payroll Train a social thriller. Taiwanese director Bai Jingrui's 1982 film Offend the Law of God has been called an exploitation social thriller and the 1996 Spanish film Taxi, about the rise of the racist right wing, has also been given the label. In his Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema, author Peter Rollberg goes a bit further than the one mention references of his peers. In describing the work of Russo Belarusian director Aleksandr Faintsimmer, Rollberg writes, Fainsimmer devoted himself to the traditionally underrepresented genre of the social thriller with blockbusters such as No Right to Fail 1974 and The Cafeteria on Piatnikskaia Street 1978 . Rollberg also names Leonid Filatov's 1982 film The Rooks and Vadim Derbenev's 1985 hit The Snake Catcher as landmarks of the genre in the Soviet Union. At the onset of the 2000s, critics and scholars continued to label a number of contemporary films as social thrillers. The authors of Sociology An Introductory Textbook and Reader wrote of the 2002 British film Dirty Pretty Things as being not a documentary but a social thriller which blends aspects of the global urban legends about child kidnapping for organs and prostitutes drugging unsuspecting barflies who wake up in a hotel bathtub minus a kidney. The New Yorker echoed this sentiment, saying, Dirty Pretty Things is not a violent thriller. It might be called a social thrillera creepy, tightly knit suspense film that, on the fly, reveals more about the lives of immigrants in London than the most scrupulously earnest documentary. Other films labeled as social thrillers from the first decade and a half of the new millennium include 2005's British production of The Constant Gardener and the 2008 Italian film As God Commands, both based on the best selling novels of the same names. The Wall Street Journal called 2011's The Social Network Part morality play, part social thriller, the 2012 Canadian child abduction film The Tall Man got called a social thriller for its DVD release, and the French film festival hit Corporate was called a social thriller in 2016, several months in advance of its 2017 release. Like the West, Indian cinema has a longstanding tradition of identifying some movies as social films or social problem films , genres that emerged when talking pictures first came to India in the 1930s. The rise of social thriller as a genre garnered familiarity in India, as it did in the U.S., in its association with a major box office hit. 2016's Pink, a courtroom drama that deals with rape, was India's highest grossing film ever to be released. Pink starred longtime Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan, who named the film a social thriller. Bachchan said of Pink that, the context and the premise of the film shall always be of prime interest, but that much is not spelt out because of the nature of the story and, of course, the nature of its genrea social thriller Before Pink the term social thriller was applied occasionally by Bollywood's directors and marketers and then repeated by the press to describe selected movies, such as 2014's film Fugly starring olympic boxing medalist Vijender Singh. Prior to Fugly's release, the press were unfamiliar with the genre, and in a film preview the India Times said that it was the movie that's been billed as a 'social thriller' whatever that is . After Fugly, other social thriller tags followed suit, such as 2014's Bhopal A Prayer for Rain about the Union Carbide Disaster, and 2015's Yeh Lall Rang about the organized crime trafficking in human blood. South Indian film columnists may have been using the term prior to their North Indian counterparts. G. Dhananjayan called the 2009 Tamil language film Achchamundu Achchamundu There is fear There is fear a social thriller, citing it as one of the rare mainstream Tamil films with the subject on pedophiles. Tamil director Bramma G. called his 2014 debut film, Kutram Kaditha, a social thriller. The same year Jean Marcose called his Malayalam film Angels a social thriller. Film Beat's Akhila Menon used the term to describe both Puthiya Niyamam and Evidam Swargamanu in 2015. Other Tamil social thrillers include 2016's Kabali, and Aagam, of which director Vijay Anand Sriram claimed, has a message but it will not be preachy. It's a social thriller with commercial elements in it . Post Pink social thrillers in Indian cinema have included Adanga Maru, Jhalki...Ek Aur Bachpan, Mulq, Pinu, Parari, Blue Whale, and Marainthirunthu, all released in 2018. Broadly categorized as a horror film, director Jordan Peele stated that his directorial debut, Get Out, was part of a lineage of social thrillers, meaning that whatever scary things manifest onscreen, society is actually the true evil. In a February 2017 interview, Peele told the Chicago Tribune, I define 'social thriller' as thriller horror movies where the ultimate villain is society. In March he told the New York Times that social thrillers all deal with this human monster, this societal monster. And the villain is us. He later told New York Magazine, I was trying to figure out what genre this movie was, and horror didn't quite do it. Psychological thriller didn't do it, and so I thought, Social thriller. The bad guy is societythese things that are innate in all of us, and provide good things, but ultimately prove that humans are always going to be barbaric, to an extent. I think I coined the term social thriller, but I definitely didnt invent it. To coincide with the release of Get Out, Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music BAM called The Art of the Social Thriller. The series featured classic horror films like Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, It's not an actual thriller, it's just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of how we deal with race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand. Anybody can relate to the fear of meeting your potential in laws for the first time... At a certain point with Get Out, I realized that I was making a sort of thriller take on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. After Get Out's success, Peele announced that he had plans to make four more social thrillers in the next decade. In an interview with Business Insider he said, The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when we get together. I've been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons. By the time Peel's second film, Us, was under production, it had veered away from its original inceptions as a social thriller and fell more squarely into the horror genre. Whereas Peele's treatment of Get Out's black protagonist and white antagonists made it a film about race, he strove to make Us not be about race. Its important to me that we can tell black stories without it being about race, Peele told Rolling Stone in early 2019. I realized I had never seen a horror movie of this kind, where theres an African American family at the center that just is. After you get over the initial realization that youre watching a black family in a horror film, youre just watching a movie. Youre just watching people. I feel like it proves a very valid and different point than Get Out, which is, not everything is about race. Get Out proved the point that everything is about race. Ive proved both points By mid 2017 the press had started touting upcoming films as belonging to the genre, including international Cannes Film Festival favorites like Colombia's Matar a Jesus, France's L'Atelier Brazil's Rifle, and the remake of Argentina's La Patota. Variety wrote that animated film Tales of the Hedgehog was both a childrens thriller and a social thriller fable after director Alain Gagnol described it as a suspenseful social fable. From Hollywood, the social media scandal movie Assassination Nation, and Greg McLean and James Gunn's The Belko Experiment, were promised as social thrillers, as was Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit as part of the social thriller canon. Musician author Boots Riley's 2018 directorial debut Sorry to Bother You was tapped as being a social thriller by both The Guardian and Deadline, and multiple reviewers compared Riley's film to Get Out. That same year Rolling Stone posited Tyrel, a drama about one black man's weekend getaway with a bunch of drunk white men, as a social thriller. In 2019 Luce, a film about the external expectations placed on young black men in America, got the social thriller tag after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival. On the eve of the 2019 Academy Awards The A.V. Club added Cam, a psychological horror film told from the perspective of an online sex worker, to the genre's roster, saying, One year after Get Out, another social thriller deserves Oscar love for its script. Likewise the website Insider clamored to see Lee Chang dong's tense social thriller Burning in this race for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2019 Academy Awards. After the 2019 Cannes Film Festival The Associated Press headline proclaimed that South Korean director Bong Joon hos social thriller Parasite wins Palme dOr and that third place jury prizes were awarded to two socially conscious thrillers The French director Ladj Lys feature film debut Les Miserables and Brazilian director Kleber Mendonca Filhos Bacurau. With Get Out helping to codify the genre, critics have continued to apply the term retrospectively, with more than one review adding the 1975 science fiction thriller The Stepford Wives to the canon. Use of social thriller as a genre term has come under scrutiny since its widened use. One critique is that niche genres such as horror are re labeled to draw a more mainstream fanbase. In a news piece about 2017's most successful horror films, journalist Haleigh Foutch wrote that Get Out is being billed as a 'social thriller' now that the film has dominated at the box office and conjured early awards buzz. Critic Jacob Knight has also cited uses of social thriller, social horror and elevated horror to describe Get Out and the 2018 films Hereditary and A Quiet Place, saying, 'elevated horror' or even 'social horror', for that matter doesnt exist. It never did, and it never will. Filmmakers have been attempting to distance themselves from the 'horror' label for decades, as its a genre thats been ghettoized for most of its existence. In an opinion piece for SYFY Wire Emma Fraser wrote that social thriller refers to a specific kind of horror but that by dressing this genre up, it actually does it a disservice. Fraser goes on to say that filmmakers like George Romero, David Cronenberg and John Carpenter have used the horror genre to address social issues such as racism or the AIDS epidemic, and that many horror films bear social significance without relying on the social thriller label. Outside the medium of cinema, literary critics have used the term social thriller as early as the first decade of the 2000s. Writing on the psychological crime novels of Ruth Rendell in 2002, Lidia Kyzlinkova at Masaryk University remarked, Rendell may be seen as having developed a kind of social thriller, in which various representations around region, class, race, gender, or age form an important part of the plot. Three years later Kyzlinkova subtitled another chapter on Rendell, Social Thriller, Ethnicity and Englishness, in which she characterized works whose plots focus less on detectives or police as being socio psychological, or social thrillers. Also writing in 2002, The New York Daily News said that Iain Pears Riverhead's book The Dream of Scipio uses a larger than ever canvas to construct this genre bending historical and social thriller. Business Wire later called Kathleen Kaufmans 2009 dystopian novel The Tree Museum an environmental thriller that follows a world completely transformed by an enigmatic and powerful totalitarian force in a review titled, New Social Thriller, The Tree Museum, to Challenge the Ethics of State Enforced Environmentalism. MacMillan Publishing described Six Suspects, Vikas Swarup's 2010 follow up to Slumdog Millionaire as a richly textured social thriller. After its proliferation as a cinematic genre, the term was used to describe DC Vertigo comic book Safe Sex. As film writers began applying the term with greater frequency after its 2017 upsurge, theatre critics followed suit. Time Out New York reviewer Adam Feldman wrote that the Broadway show Junk melds a breadth of genrescrime story, tragedy, issue play, cautionary taleinto a fast moving, broad ranging social thriller. By 2018 the term had leapt to television, and was used to describe the Netflix series What If and indian series Criminal Justice. In September 2018 The New York Times highlighted a number of fiction podcasts as contributions to the social thriller genre, chiefly the politically charged dystopian fantasy Adventures in New America by filmmakers Stephen Winter and Tristan Cowen. Audio fiction publisher Night Vale Presents touted the term on its own website, citing comparisons to Boots Riley's film Sorry to Bother You and the work of Jordan Peele. The Times also cited Gimlet Media's subterranean serial The Horror of Dolores Roach and Panoply Media's airline disaster whodunit Passenger List as being among the social thrillers cropping up in the new wave of serialized audio fiction.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%20thriller
"Progressive Era Repression and persecution Anti war and civil rights movements Contemporary The Socialist Party USA, officially the Socialist Party of the United States of America SPUSA , is a multi tendency democratic socialist party in the United States. The SPUSA was founded in 1973 as a successor to the Socialist Party of America, which had been renamed Social Democrats, USA a year before. The party is officially committed to multi tendency democratic socialism. Along with its predecessor, the Socialist Party USA has received varying degrees of support when its candidates have competed against those from the Republican and Democratic parties. The SPUSA advocates for complete independence from the Democratic Party. Self described as opposing all forms of oppression, specifically capitalism and authoritarian forms of communism, the party advocates for the creation of a radical democracy that places people's lives under their own control , a non racist, classless, feminist, socialist society in which the people own and control the means of production and distribution through democratically controlled public agencies, cooperatives, or other collective groups full employment is realized for everyone who wants to work workers have the right to form unions freely, and to strike and engage in other forms of job actions and production of society is used for the benefit of all humanity, not for the private profit of a few . Headquartered at the A. J. Muste Institute, the SPUSA's National Office is located at 168 Canal Street in the Chinatown neighborhood of New York City. The party has four chartered state organizations in California, Michigan, Maine and New Jersey as well as twenty eight chartered locals throughout the country. In October 2015, the Socialist Party USA nominated Mimi Soltysik for President and Angela Nicole Walker for Vice President. In 1958, the Independent Socialist League led by Max Shachtman dissolved to join the Socialist Party of America. Shachtman had written that Soviet communism was a new form of class society, bureaucratic collectivism, in which the ruling class exploited and oppressed the population and therefore he opposed the spread of communism. Shachtman also argued that democratic socialists should work with activists from labor unions and civil rights organizations to help build a social democratic realignment of the Democratic Party. Though he died on November 4, 1972 and had little involvement with the Socialist Party in the year proceeding his death, his followers, identitified as Shachmanites , exercised a tremendous amount of influence on the party. In its 1972 convention, the Socialist Party changed its name to Social Democrats, USA by a vote of 73 to 34. The change of name was supported by the two Co Chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union ILGWU and by the First National Vice Chairman James S. Glaserthese three were re elected by acclamation. Renaming the party as SDUSA was meant to be realistic . The New York Times observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored Darlington Hoopes as its candidate for President in the 1956 election, who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name party had been misleading party had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name Socialist was replaced by Social Democrats because many American associated the word socialism with Soviet communism. The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties. The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, 8 seats for Harrington's coalition caucus, 2 for the Debs caucus and one for the independent Samuel H. Friedman, who also had opposed the name change. The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two one vote, with the majority caucus winning every vote. On foreign policy, the program called for firmness toward Communist aggression . However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission and to work for a peace agreement that would protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for an immediate cease fire and an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces was defeated. Harrington complained that after its previous convention, the Socialist Party had endorsed George McGovern with a statement of constructive criticism and had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. After their defeat at the convention, members of two minority caucuses helped to found new socialist organizations. At most 200 members of the Coalition Caucus joined Michael Harrington in forming the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee DSOC , which later became the Democratic Socialists of America DSA . At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington. Second, many members of the Debs Caucus joined David McReynolds in reconstituting the Socialist Party USA also in 1973. The Debs Caucus formed the Union for Democratic Socialism and on May 30, 1973 incorporated the Socialist Party of the United States of America, usually simplified as the Socialist Party USA. third party source needed Many activists from the local and state branches of the old Socialist Party, including the party's Wisconsin, California, Illinois, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. organizations, participated in the reconstitution of the Socialist Party USA. third party source needed After its founding, the party promoted itself as the legitimate heir of the Socialist Party of America. Former Mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler, was elected the first national chairperson of the party. Zeidler also helped re organizing the party structure during its early years. He was later nominated as the party's candidacy for the presidential office, with Zeidler believing the party would be able to collaborate with other socialist parties nationwide to spread the message of socialism. Since 1976, a member of the party was elected to the city council of Iowa City and several members have won tens of thousands of votes in elections for statewide offices. In 1992, Socialist Iowa City Councilwoman Karen Kubby won her re election with the highest vote in a contested election in the history of the Iowa City Council and was re elected until retiring from the Council in 2000. In 2000, Socialist Wendell Harris received 19 of the vote for Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the primary. In 2008, Socialist Jon Osborne pulled in 22 of the vote for Rhode Island's 34th District State Senate seat while listed on the ballot under the Socialist Party USA label. During the 2010 United States Senate elections, Dan La Botz of the Socialist Party of Ohio received 25,368 0.68 votes in Ohio. In 2011, Socialist Matt Erard was elected to a three year term on the city of Detroit's Downtown District Citizens' District Council. In 2012, Socialist Pat Noble unseated his incumbent opponent in winning election to the Red Bank Regional High School Board of Education, Socialist John Strinka received 10 of the vote while running with the party's ballot label for Indiana's 39th district State House seat and Socialist Troy Thompson received 27 of the vote for Mayor of Floodwood, Minnesota. Also in 2012, candidate Mary Alice Herbert received 13.1 of the vote for Vermont Secretary of State while running with the dual nomination of both the Socialist and Vermont Liberty Union parties. For the 2016 general election, the Socialist Party nominated Mimi Soltysik and Angela Nicole Walker to be its presidential ticket. Other party members ran for office as well, including Jarrod Williams for United States Senate in Nevada, Seth Baker for Maine Senate and Michael Anderson for the Michigan House of Representatives. According to the party's first chairman, Frank Zeidler, the party had around 500 members nationwide in 1975. The Socialist Party experienced substantial growth during the late 1970s and early to mid 1980s, expanding from only around 600 dues paying members to around 1,700. In 2008, WMNF claimed that the party had around 3,000 paying members. However, a CommonDreams article suggested that the organization had only 1,000 members in 2010, with party members claiming it to be an increase in the number of members. In May 2011, an article from The New York Times stated that the party has about 1,000 members nationally . In February 2012, an article from The Root stated that the party had a membership around 1,500 . While some party members favor a more gradual approach to socialism, most others envision a more sweeping or revolutionary transformation of society from capitalist to socialist through the decisive victory of the working class in the class struggle. Some party members also advocate revolutionary nonviolence or pacifism while some consider armed struggle a possible necessity. The party's Statement of Principles rejects equating socialism with a welfare state and calls for democratic social revolution from below. The party is strongly committed to principles of socialist feminism and strives to further embody such commitment in its organizational structure. Its national constitution requires gender parity among its national Co Chairs and Co Vice Chairs, its National Committee members and alternates and seated members of its branch and region elected delegations to the party's biennial National Conventions. The Socialist Party also rejected the new healthcare reform law of 2010 approved by the Obama administration, with Socialist Party National Co Chair Billy Wharton claiming it to be a corporate restructuring of the health insurance industry created to protect the profit margins of private insurance companies . During his campaign, 2008 Socialist Party candidate for President Brian Moore was very vocal against the idea that Barack Obama was a socialist of any kind. He further commented on the issue, saying it was misleading of the Republicans to spread that message. In a later statement about Obama's policies, Wharton called Obama's 2010 State of the Union Address a public relations ploy and concluded saying The time for slick public relations campaigns has endedthe time for building our grassroots movements is more urgent than ever. The Socialist Party USA stands ready to join in such a political revitalization . The Party's National Action Committee condemned the Israeli actions during the Gaza War. The party demands that the Federal government of the United States cease providing military aid to Israel as a precondition for peace. The party also seeks to begin an immediate withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. During the 2008 presidential election, the Socialist Party continued to place a strong emphasis on its full scale opposition to American wars abroad, with Brian Moore, the presidential candidate, claiming the war was destroying small communities throughout the country. He also criticized what he called pressure on the local governments by the Bush administration. The Socialist Party of Connecticut denounced Obama's troop surge in Afghanistan, claiming that the President wasted needed resources the country needed to get pulled out of the financial crisis. After denouncing him, the state affiliate organized a protest in front of the federal building in Hartford. In April 2017, the party issued a statement opposing further United States intervention into the Syrian Civil War. Ten days later, the party issued a follow up statement opposing both the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack and United States' subsequent missile strike. In May 2017, the party condemned the Manchester Arena bombing and stood against any attempt to turn this tragedy into political capital to further right wing agendas and target oppressed communities . Socialist Party candidates, such as New Jersey gubernatorial and senate candidate Greg Pason, have also emphasized immediate public service demandsthese reforms include socializing the United States health care system, a steeply graduated income tax, universal rent control and the elimination of all educational debts and tuition fees. In 1997, Pason called auto insurance a regressive tax against working people . Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and socialized medicine. Moore believes that capitalism is a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to serve the interests of corporations and the ruling class at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign, he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon greed and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions. As of August 2017 , the Socialist Party had twenty four chartered locals and five chartered state parties.

"The Han dynasty 206 BCE 220 CE was a period of Ancient China divided into the Western Han 206 BCE 9 CE and Eastern Han 25220 CE periods, when the capital cities were located at Chang'an and Luoyang, respectively. It was founded by Emperor Gaozu of Han and briefly interrupted by the regime of Wang Mang r. 923 CE who usurped the throne from a child Han emperor. The Han dynasty was an age of great economic, technological, cultural, and social progress in China. Its society was governed by an emperor who shared power with an official bureaucracy and semi feudal nobility. Its laws, customs, literature, and education were largely guided by the philosophy and ethical system of Confucianism, yet the influence of Legalism and Daoism from the previous Zhou dynasty could still be seen. Members of the scholarly gentry class who aspired to hold public office were required to receive a Confucian based education. A new synthetic ideology of Han Confucianism was created when the scholar Dong Zhongshu 179104 BCE united the Confucian canon allegedly edited by Kongzi, or Confucius 551479 BCE , with cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the Chinese five elements. Although the social status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan craftsmen were considered above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which allowed them to rival the social prestige of even the most powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were at the bottom of the social order, yet they represented only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state employed religious occultists could make a decent living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi fl. 6th century BCE as a holy prophet. The typical Han era Chinese household contained a nuclear family with an average of four to five members, unlike in later dynasties when multiple generations and extended family members commonly lived in the same household. Families were patrilineal, which made the father the supreme head of the house. Arranged marriages were the norm, while a new wife was expected to join the clan of her husband. Having sons over daughters was considered extremely important for the sake of carrying on ancestor worship. Although girls and women were expected by custom and Confucian tradition to behave passively towards their male relatives, mothers were given a familial status above that of their sons. Women also engaged in various professions in and outside of the home and were given protection under the law. The empress was superior in status to the male relatives of her consort clan, while the mother of the emperorthe empress dowagerhad the authority to override his decisions and choose his successor if one had not been appointed before his death . At the apex of Han society was the emperor, a member of the Liu family and thus a descendant of the founder Emperor Gaozu r. 202 195 BCE . His subjects were not allowed to address him by name instead they used indirect references such as under the steps to the throne bixia or superior one shang . If a commoner, government minister, or noble entered the palace without official permission, the punishment was execution. Although the Commandant of Justiceone of the central government's Nine Ministerswas in charge of meting out sentences in court cases, the emperor not only had the ability to override the Commandant's decision, but also had the sole ability to draft new laws or repeal old ones. An emperor could pardon anyone and grant general amnesties. Although the emperor often obeyed the majority consensus of his ministers in court conferences tingyi , his approval was still needed for any state policy decision and he sometimes even rejected the majority opinion. The emperor's most powerful relative was the empress dowager, widow to the previous emperor and usually the natural mother of the emperor. If the grandmother of an emperorthe grand empress dowagerwas still alive during his reign, she enjoyed a superior position over the empress dowager. Emperors often sought the approval of the empress dowager for their decisions. If an emperor was only a child, he acted merely as a figurehead while the empress dowager dominated court politics. She not only had the right to issue edicts and pardons, but if the emperor died without a designated heir, she had the sole right to appoint a new emperor. Below the empress dowager were the empress and imperial concubines. Although she was the wife of the emperor, the empress's position at court was not secure and she could be removed by the emperor. However, the empress did enjoy the submission of concubines as her subordinates, who advocated the elevation of their sons over the empress's at their own peril. In the early Western Han, imperial relatives and some military officers who had served Emperor Gaozu were made kings who ruled over large semi autonomous fiefs, but once the non related kings had died off, an imperial edict outlawed all non Liu family members from becoming kings. The emperor's brothers, paternal cousins, brother's sons, and emperor's sonsexcluding the heir apparentwere made kings. The emperor's sisters and daughters were made princesses with fiefs. Although the central government eventually stripped away the political power of the kings and appointed their administrative staffs, kings still had a right to collect a portion of the taxes in their territory as personal income and enjoyed a social status that ranked just below the emperor. Each king had a son designated to be heir apparent, while his other sons and brothers were given the rank of marquess and ruled over small marquessates where a portion of the taxes went to their private purse. Although kings and marquesses enjoyed many privileges, the imperial court was at times aggressive towards them to check their power. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, thousands of noble families, including those from the royal houses of Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Han, and Wei from the Warring States period, were forcibly moved to the vicinity of the capital Chang'an. In the first half of Western Han, resettlement could also be imposed on powerful and wealthy officials as well as individuals who owned property worth more than a million cash. The position of regent officially known as General in Chief was created during Emperor Wu's reign r. 14187 BCE when he appointed three officials to form a triumvirate regency over the central government while the child Emperor Zhao r. 8774 BCE sat on the throne. Regents were often relatives in law to the emperor through his empress's family, but they could also be men of lowly means who depended on the emperor's favor to advance their position at court. Eunuchs who maintained the harem of the palace could also gain a similar level of power. They often came from the middle class and had links to trade. In the Western Han, there are only a handful of examples where eunuchs rose to power since the official bureaucracy was strong enough to suppress them. After the eunuch Shi Xian became the Prefect of the Palace Masters of Writing , Emperor Yuan r. 4833 BCE relinquished much of his authority to him, so that he was allowed to make vital policy decisions and was respected by officials. However, Shi Xian was expelled from office once Emperor Cheng 337 BCE took the throne. No palace eunuch would obtain comparable authority again until after 92 CE, when the eunuchs led by Zheng Zhong d. 107 CE sided with Emperor He r. 88105 CE in a coup to overthrow the Dou clan of the empress dowager. Officials complained when eunuchs like Sun Cheng d. 132 CE were awarded by Emperor Shun r. 125144 CE with marquessates, yet after the year 135 CE the eunuchs were given legal authority to pass on fiefs to adopted sons. Although Emperor Ling r. 168189 CE relinquished a great deal of authority to eunuchs Zhao Zhong d. 189 CE and Zhang Rang d. 189 CE , the eunuchs were slaughtered in 189 CE when Yuan Shao d. 202 CE besieged and stormed the palaces of Luoyang. Those who served in government had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs . They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain the approval of the emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellenciesexcluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, in the beginning of the dynasty, having a total assessed taxable wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced. Starting in Western Han was a system of recommendation where local officials submitted proposals to the capital on which of their subordinates were worthy candidates for holding office this created a patron client relationship between former superiors and successful nominees to higher office. With the enhanced prestige of the consort clan under Empress Dowager Dou d. 97 CE , a succession of regents from her clan and others amassed a large number of clients whose chances of promotion hinged on the political survival of the empress dowager's clan, which was often short lived. Aside from patron client relationships, one could use family connections to secure office. Patricia Ebrey writes that in the Western Han, access to public office and promotion through social mobility were open to a larger segment of the populace than in Eastern Han. A third of the two hundred and fifty two Eastern Han government officials who had biographies in the Book of Later Han were sons or grandsons of officials, while a fifth came from prominent provincial families or had ancestors who had served as officials. For forty six of the one hundred and ten years between 86 and 196 CE, at least one post of the Three Excellencies was occupied by a member of either the Yuan or Yang clan. Many central government officials also began their careers as subordinate officers for commandery level administrations. There are only rare cases i.e. involving military merit during rebellions of late Eastern Han when subordinate officers of county level administrations advanced to the level of central government. Even if one secured an office by these means, an official was still expected to be competent, thus a formal education became the hallmark of those aspiring to fill public office. In addition to private tutoring, the Imperial University was established in 124 BCE which then accommodated only fifty pupils, but by the 2nd century CE the student body had reached about thirty thousand. These students could be appointed by the emperor to various government posts according to their examination grades. Despite a decline in social mobility for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry classwhich became fully consolidated during the Eastern Hanconsisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho Yun Hsu asserts that at this point officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable. In a show of solidarity against the eunuchs' interference in court politics with the coup against the regent Liang Ji d. 159 CE , a widespread student protest broke out where Imperial University students took to the streets and chanted the names of the eunuchs they opposed. At the instigation of the eunuchs, Emperor Huan r. 146168 CE initiated the Partisan Prohibitions in 166 CE, a wide scale proscription against Li Ying and his associates in the Imperial University and in the provinces from holding office branded as partisans . With the suicide of regent Dou Wu d. 168 CE in his confrontation with the eunuchs shortly after Emperor Ling r. 168189 CE was placed on the throne, the eunuchs banned hundreds more from holding office while selling offices at the highest bidder. Repulsed by what they viewed as a corrupted government, many gentrymen considered a moral, scholarly life superior to holding office, and thus rejected nominations to serve at court. Until they were repealed in 184 CE to garner gentry support against the Yellow Turban Rebellion , the partisant prohibitions created a large independent, disaffected portion of the gentry who did not simply return to a reclusive life in their hometowns, but maintained contacts with other gentry throughout China and actively engaged in the protest movement. Acknowledging that the gentry class was able to recruit and certify itself, the Chancellor Cao Cao 155220 CE established the nine rank system where a distinguished gentry figure in each county and commandery would assign local gentlemen a rank that the government would use to evaluate nominees for office. Many scholars who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not looked down upon by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers diannong who paid rent in the form of roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers gunong and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner cultivators was above tenants and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market. During the Western Han, farming peasants formed the majority of those who were conscripted by the government to perform corvee labor or military duties. For the labor service gengzu , males aged fifteen to fifty six would be drafted for one month out of the year to work on construction projects and perform other duties in their commanderies and counties. For the military obligation zhengzu , all males aged twenty three were to train for one year in one of three branches of the military infantry, cavalry, or navy. Until they reached age fifty six, they were liable to perform one year of active service as troops sent to guard the frontiers from hostile nomads or to act as guards in the capital city. Significant changes were made to this system during Eastern Han a commuting tax could be paid by peasants if they wanted to avoid the one month labor obligation, since hired labor became more popular in construction and other projects. The military service obligation could even be avoided if a peasant paid a commuting tax, since the Eastern Han military became largely a volunteer force. Other commoners such as merchants were also able to join the army. Artisans and craftsmen during the Han had a socio economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some were able to obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords and was able to eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants. Despite their legal privileges over that of merchants, the work of artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by a small minority of Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self sufficient villages and without commercial interests. Artisans could be privately employed or they could work for the government. While government workshops employed convicts, corvee laborers, and state owned slaves to perform menial tasks, the master craftsman was paid a significant income for his work in producing luxury items such as bronze mirrors and lacquerwares. With the exception of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did not engage in trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced to selling wares as street peddlers were not to be taxed as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax. Registered merchants were forced by law to wear white colored clothes, an indication of their low status, and could be singled out for conscription into the armed forces and forced to resettle in lands to the deep south where malaria was known to be prevalent. In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo d. 154 BCE states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials. Although these laws were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's persecution of merchants when in 119 BCE he made it illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated this law, their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. The effectiveness of this law is questionable, since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of goldequivalent to ten million cash coinswas considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred times larger than the average income of a middle class landowner cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government. Merchants engaged in a multitude of private trades and industries. A single merchant often combined several trades to make greater profits, such as animal breeding, farming, manufacturing, trade, and money lending. Some of the most profitable commodities sold during the Han were salt and iron, since a wealthy salt or iron distributor could own properties worth as much as ten million cash. In the early Western Han period, powerful merchants could muster a workforce of over a thousand peasants to work in salt mines and marshes to evaporate brine to make salt, or at ironworks sites where they operated bellows and casted iron implements. To curb the influence of such wealthy industrialists, Emperor Wu nationalized these industries by 117 BCE and for the first time drafted former merchants with technical know how such as Sang Hongyang d. 80 BCE to head these government monopolies. However, by the Eastern Han period the central government abolished the state monopolies on salt and iron. Even before this, the state must have halted its employment of former merchants in the government salt and iron agencies, since an edict of 7 BCE restated the ban on merchants entering the bureaucracy. However, the usurper Wang Mang r. 923 CE did employ some merchants as low level officials with a salary rank of 600 bushels. Another profitable industry was brewing wine and liquor, which the state briefly monopolized from 98 to 81 BCE, yet relinquished its production to private merchants once again with alcohol taxes reinstalled . The official Cui Shi d. 170 CE started a brewery business to help pay for his father's costly funeral, an act which was heavily criticized by his fellow gentrymen who considered this sideline occupation a shameful one for any scholar. Cinnabar mining was also a very lucrative industry. Commoners known as guests and retainers binke who lived on the property of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly proteges, or astrologers. A host treated his retainers very well and showered them with luxury gifts if he wanted to boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy on how to deal with retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him. Retainers formed a large portion of the fighting forces amassed by the future Emperor Guangwu r. 2557 CE during the civil war against Wang Mang's failing regime. The military role of retainers became much more pronounced by the late 2nd century CE during the political turmoil that would eventually split the empire into three competing states. By then, hosts began to treat retainers as their personal troops buqu , which undercut the freedoms of mobility and independence that earlier retainers had enjoyed. Whereas individual retainers had earlier joined a host by their own personal decision, by the late 2nd century CE the lives of the retainers' entire families became heavily controlled by the host. Slaves nuli comprised roughly 1 of the population, a proportion far less than the contemporary Greco Roman world which relied on the labor of a large slave population. Slaves were classified into two categories those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned slaves were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State owned slaves were sometimes prisoners of war yet not all were made slaves . However, most slaves were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves. State owned slaves were put to work in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and sometimes state owned agricultural fields, while privately owned slaves were employed in domestic services and sometimes farming. However, the vast majority of non independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or slaves, but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It might have been more economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of slaves, since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned the same rate merchants had to pay for their poll tax . Government slaves were not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han . Privately owned slaves were usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians. The children of both government and private slaves were born slaves. Government slaves could be granted freedom by the emperor if they were deemed too elderly, if the emperor pitied them, or if they committed a meritous act worthy of a manumission. In one exceptional case, the former slave Jin Midi d. 86 BCE became one of the regents over the government. Private slaves could buy their freedom from their master, while some masters chose to free their slaves. Although slaves were subject to beatings if they did not obey their masters, it was against the law to murder a slave kings were stripped of their kingdoms after it was found that they had murdered slaves, while Wang Mang even forced one of his sons to commit suicide for murdering a slave. An edict of 35 CE repealed the death penalty for any slave who killed a commoner. Not all slaves had the same social status. Some slaves of wealthy families lived better than commoners since they were allowed to wear luxurious clothes and consume quality food and wine. Slaves of high officials could even be feared and respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang d. 68 BCE sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize after a scuffle with his slaves over the right of way on the street , and were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence. In addition to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, there were many other occupations. The pig breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar to pay for a formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig breeder Gongsun Hong of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo d. 208 CE was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace . Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasionssuch as with Luan Da d. 112 BCE an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He d. 189 CE and her brother, the regent He Jin d. 189 CE , came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials. The Han court upheld a socio economic ranking system for commoners and nobles, which was based on the twenty ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang d. 338 BCE of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 excluding slaves could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary see table to the right , newly promoted men were granted wine and ox meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief. Promotions in rank were decided by the emperor and could occur on special occasions, such as installation of a new emperor, inauguration of a new reign title, the wedding of a new empress, or the selection of a royal heir apparent. The central government sometimes sold ranks to collect more revenues for the state. The official Chao Cuo d. 154 BCE once wrote that anyone who presented a substantial amount of agricultural grain to the government would also be promoted in rank. During the Han, the empire was divided into large administrative units of kingdoms and commanderies within a commandery there were counties, and within counties there were districts that contained at least several hamlets. An average hamlet contained about a hundred families and usually was enclosed by a wall with two gates. At the center of social life in the hamlet was the religious altar built in honor of a local deity where festivities could be staged. Each district and county also had an official religious altar. The official reach of government extended no further than the district level, where county appointed officials included the chief of police who maintained law and order and the district tax collector. However, the government was able to control local society at the hamlet level with their bestowal of twenty ranks. The government funded flood control projects involving the building of new canals, thus aiding the speed of waterborne transport and allowing undeveloped areas to become irrigated farmlands. These conscription labor projects allowed for the building of new hamlets which were dependent on the government for their livelihoods. When the authority of the central government declined in the late Eastern Han period, many commoners living in such hamlets were forced to flee their lands and work as tenants on large estates of wealthy landowners. The people of older hamlets which never had to rely on central government projects for their wellbeing or existence often sought support from powerful local families. The Western Han capital at Chang'an was divided into one hundred and sixty walled residential wards. Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low ranking official. Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order. Historians are still unsure as to how many government controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an. Although there are claims of nine markets, it is possible that seven of them were actually divisible parts of two main markets the East Market and West Market. Both the East Market and West Market had a two story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof. A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, yet not much is known about their involvement in the marketplace. In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty six sub officers who ventured into the marketplace daily to maintain law and order. They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and their customers or clients. Besides merchants engaging in marketplace violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang. The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals. There were many amusements in the cities which could attract audiences rich and poor, such as trained animals performing tricks, cockfighting and caged animal fights between tigers, horse racing, puppet shows, musical performances with dancing, acrobatic feats, and juggling. Wealthy families could afford their own house choirs and five piece orchestras with bells, drums, flutes, and stringed instruments. Gambling and board games such as liubo also provided entertainment. Chinese kinship relations during the Han were influenced by Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin to be part of their clan instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty 221206 BCE law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period 220265 CE . The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty 618907 CE , a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty 265420 , when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace. The Chinese clan or lineage involved men who shared a common patrilineal ancestor, yet were divided into subgroups whose behavior towards each other was regulated according to Confucian mores which dictated what relative should be closer and more intimate. The four different subgroups were 1 brother, brother's sons, and brother's grandsons 2 father's brothers, father's brother's sons and grandsons 3 paternal grandfather's brothers, their sons, and grandsons and 4 paternal great grandfather's brothers, their sons, grandsons, and great grandsons. While one was expected to mourn for an entire year over the death of any relative in the first subgroup, one was expected to mourn for only five months when a relative in the second subgroup had died. No ritual mourning was expected at all for relatives in the third and fourth subgroups. While a son mourned three years for a father's death, he only mourned one year for his mother's. Since carrying on the patrilineal line meant the continuation of ancestor worship, it was important to have at least one son, even if he was adopted from another family although it was considered imperative that he share the same surname, otherwise his ancestral sacrifices could be considered null and void . The majority of clan or lineage groups were not very influential in local society. However, prominent kinship groups could enjoy a great deal of ad hoc influence, especially if a member served as a government official. Wealthy scholars or officials often shared the same kinship group with poor commoners. Since clan members were expected to defend fellow members even to the point of murder , government authorities constantly struggled to suppress powerful kinship groups. Local lineage groups formed the backbone of rebel forces in the popular uprising against Wang Mang in the early 1st century CE. When central government authority broke down in the late Eastern Han, less developed areas of the country remained relatively stable due to entrenched kinship groups, while in heavily developed areas where kinship groups had been effectively broken down by the state there were many more peasants willing to turn to rebel movements for protection and survival. Although romantic love was not discouraged, marriages were arranged as agreements and bonds formed between two clans with property as the chief concern , not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could become part of the husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife. Although the ideal ages for marriage were thirty for a man and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried women between the ages of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons . Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor. By custom there were seven conditions where a man could divorce his wife. These were 1 disobedience to parents in law, 2 barrenness unable to continue family line , 3 adultery mixing another clan's blood into the family , 4 jealousy of concubines , 5 incurable disease unable to continue family line , 6 loquacity not getting along with brothers in law or sisters in law , and 7 theft. However, a husband was not allowed to divorce his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, if there were no living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the divorce and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon especially since divorce meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex husband's family , it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups. The two types of inheritance during Han included the common inheritance of property from the deceased, which all social groups except for slaves participated in, and the inheritance of titles, which only the people of twenty ranks, nobility, and royalty could enjoy. In the first form, officials and commoners bequeathed an equal share of property to each of their sons in their will. This excluded daughters, who married into other families and thus did not carry on the family name. However, daughters did receive a portion of the family property in the form of their marriage dowries, which were sometimes equal to a brother's share of wealth in the will. The second type of inheritance involved the practice of primogeniture, where the official title was inherited by only one son. This was as true of the emperor as it was for any king, marquess, or commoner of the twenty ranks. However, to limit the power of the kings while still upholding primogeniture, an imperial edict of 127 BCE stated that kings had to divide the territories of their kingdoms between the chosen successor i.e. heir apparent and the kings' brothers, who were made marquesses, thus establishing new marquessates and effectively reducing the size of every kingdom with each generation. Historian Ban Zhao 45116 CE wrote in her Lessons for Women that, like the opposite and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend to the will of first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son . However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband , wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives even her father and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them. Certain occupations were traditionally reserved for women, while they were also exempted from corvee labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus had to make a living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver. The historian Sima Tan d. 110 BCE wrote that the Legalist tradition inherited by Han from the previous Qin dynasty taught that imposing severe man made laws which were short of kindness would produce a well ordered society, given that human nature was innately immoral and had to be checked. 'Legalism' was the label created by Han scholars to describe the socio political philosophy formulated largely by Shen Buhai d. 340 BCE , Shang Yang d. 338 BCE , and Han Fei c. 280 c. 233 BCE , a philosophy which stressed that government had to rely on a strict system of punishments and rewards to maintain law and order. Some early Western Han officials were influenced by the tenet of 'nonaction' apparent in Han Fei's work and the Daoist Laozi. By utilizing this concept, they argued that once laws and administrative systems were set in place, the government functioned smoothly and intervention on behalf of the ruler became unnecessary. This school of thought was known as 'Yellow Emperor and Laozi' Huang Lao , which gained full acceptance at court under the patronage of Empress Dowager Dou d. 135 BCE . Its followers believed that the originator of ordered civilization was the mythical Yellow Emperor, a view that contradicted later Confucian scholars' views that the mythological Yao and Shun were responsible for bringing man out of a state of anarchy. Works such as the Huainanzi presented in 139 BCE introduced new systematic ideas about the cosmos which undercut the message of Huang Lao thought. Scholars such as Shusun Tong began to express greater emphasis for ethical ideas espoused in 'Classicist' philosophical works such as those of Kongzi i.e. Confucius, 551479 BCE , an ideology anachronistically known as Confucianism. Emperor Gaozu found Shusun Tong's Confucian reforms of court rituals useful so long as they further exalted his status, yet it was not until Emperor Wu's reign that Confucianism gained exclusive patronage at court. At the core of Confucian ethics were the selected virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang as well as the five phases i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu 179104 BCE . Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang 798 BCE or Liu Xin d. 23 CE , three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st century CE Book of Han. Since his model incorporated and justified the imperial government into the natural order of the universe, it appealed to Emperor Wu, who in 136 BCE abolished non Confucian academic chairs or erudites not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics the Classic of Poetry, the Classic of Changes, the Classic of Rites, the Classic of History, and the Spring and Autumn Annals. Expanding on the position of Mengzi c. 372 289 BCE that human nature was innately good, Dong wrote that people needed external nourishment of education to become 'awakened' and develop morality. To produce morally sound officials, Emperor Wu further sponsored Confucian education when he established the Imperial University in 124 BCE. Despite mainstream acceptance of Confucianism for the rest of Han and until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1911 , philosophers still defended some Legalist ideas while the state's laws and policies reflect a compromise reached between Legalism and Han Confucianism. There were varying regional traditions or 'schools' within Confucianism assigned to certain texts. The two which caused most debate were New Texts and Old Texts traditions. The former represented works transmitted orally after the Qin book burning of 213 BCE, and the latter was newly discovered texts alleged by Kong Anguo, Liu Xin, and others to have been excavated from the walls of Kongzi's home, displayed archaic written characters, and thus were more authentic versions. Although initially rejected, the Old Texts found acceptance at the courts of Emperor Ping r. 1 BCE 5 CE and Wang Mang, were rejected by Emperor Guangwu, and accepted once more by Emperor Zhang only to be rejected a third time by the following rulers. In contrast to Dong's certainty about innate goodness, the contemporary writer Jia Yi 201169 BCE synthesized the opposing perspectives of Mengzi and Xunzi c. 312 c. 230 BCE in the chapter Protecting and Tutoring Baofu of his book New Recommendations Xinshu to argue that human nature was malleable and thus neither originally good or evil. Han Confucianism was transformed in the Eastern Han period when scholars struggled to understand how Wang Mang's regime had failed despite its great sponsorship of Confucian reform. The transition from Western Han idealism to Eastern Han skepticism can be represented in part by the Exemplary Sayings Fayan of Yang Xiong 53 BCE 18 CE , who argued that human nature was indeterminate, that one could cultivate good and escape negative situations by learning the valuable precepts of many schools of thought not just Confucianism , yet man had no control over his ultimate fate decided by Heaven. In his New Discussions Xinlun , Huan Tan 43 BCE 28 CE argued that although the Han court sponsored Confucian education, the government had become corrupt and thus undermined Dong Zhongshu's cosmically ordained belief that Confucian education went hand in hand with political success. In his Balanced Discourse Lunheng , Wang Chong 27100 CE argued that human life was not a coherent whole dictated by a unitary will of Heaven as in Dong's synthesis, but rather was broken down into three planes biological mental and physical , sociopolitical, and moral, elements which interacted with each other to produce different results and random fate. Eastern Han Confucians incorporated ideas of Legalism and Daoism to explain how society could be salvaged, such as Wang Fu 78163 CE in his Comments of a Recluse Qian fu lun who argued that the evils accumulated by mankind over time could be rectified by direct engagement of the body politic the Legalist approach , but that the individual had to cultivate personal virtue in the meantime as a long term solution the Daoist approach . In order to secure a position as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students could choose to enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school in a small town or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions. Before the Records of the Grand Historian Shiji by Sima Qian 14586 BCE , there existed terse chronicles of events such as the Spring and Autumn Annals and the chronicle found at Shuihudi covering events in the State of Qin and Qin dynasty from 306 to 217 BCE. There was also the Classic of Historypart of the Confucian canonwhich recorded the deeds of past rulers and political events sometimes mythological instead of historical . However, Sima's work is considered the first of China's Standard Histories, laid the groundwork for Chinese historiography by creating the first universal history of China. He divided his work of one hundred and thirty chapters into basic annals, chronological tables in grid format with year by year accounts since 841 BCE, the start of the Gonghe Regency , treatises on general subjects such as the economy and the calendar , histories of hereditary houses and states, biographies on individuals arranged in roughly chronological order, and his own autobiography as the last chapter. Being a court archivist allowed Sima to utilize eighty textual sources in addition to memorials, edicts, and stone inscriptions. These sources enhanced the enormous scope of his work, which mentions roughly four thousand people by name. He also traveled extensively to interview witnesses for more recent accounts. Unlike the Western historiographical tradition established by the Greek Herodotus c. 484 c. 425 BCE , University of North Carolina associate professor Dr. Grant Hardy asserts that Sima's work was intended to be a textual microcosm representing every aspect of the Universe, Earth, and Man in model form, in much the same way that the raised relief map in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang r. 221210 BCE represented his empire. Hardy explains that this was not unique to Sima's work, as Han scholars believed encoded secrets existed in the Spring and Autumn Annals, which was deemed a microcosm incorporating all the essential moral and historical principles by which the world operated and future events could be prognosticated. However, Hardy's microcosm thesis as an explanation for the Shiji's inconsistencies in ideological approach, organization, and literary characteristics has been criticized by Michael Loewe and David Schaberg. They express doubt about Hardy's view that Sima intended his work to be a well planned, homogeneous model of reality, rather than a loosely connected collection of narratives which retains the original ideological biases of the various sources used. The next Standard History was the Book of Han, compiled by Ban Biao 354 CE , his son Ban Gu 3292 CE , and his daughter Ban Zhao 45116 CE . Unlike Sima's private and independent work, this history text was commissioned and sponsored by the Han court under Emperor Ming r. 5775 CE , who let Ban Gu use the imperial archives. This set a significant precedent for the rest of the Standard Histories, since the historian was now virtually unable to criticize his ruling patron. The Book of Han covered the history of China left off from Sima's work during Emperor Wu's reign up until the middle Eastern Han. Although the Records of the Three Kingdoms included events in late Eastern Han, no history work focused exclusively on the Eastern Han period until the Book of Later Han was compiled by Fan Ye 398445 CE . The Ready Guide Erya is the oldest known Chinese dictionary and was compiled sometime in the 3rd century BCE before the Han. Dictionaries written during the Han dynasty include Yang Xiong's Regional Speech Fangyan of 15 BCE and Xu Shen's c. 58 c. 147 CE Explaining Unitary Characters and Analyzing Compound Characters Shuowen Jiezi of 121 CE. Yang Xiong's Fangyan was the first Chinese dialect vocabulary work the modern Chinese term for 'dialect' is derived from the title of this book. In the Shuowen Jiezi, Xu Shen divided written characters between wen and zi , where the former were original pictographs and the latter were characters derived from them. Listing 9,353 characters with 1,163 variant forms, Xu arranged these into 540 section headers according to their written radicals. This convenient and systematic approach of arranging characters by their radicals became the standard for all Chinese dictionaries to follow. Handbooks, guides, manuals, and treatises for various subjects were written in the Han. The Western Han Book of Fan Shengzhi Fan Shengzhi shu written during Emperor Cheng's reign is one of two manuals on agricultural techniques and processes that have survived from the Han. The other is the Eastern Han Monthly Instructions for the Four Classes of People Simin yueling written by Cui Shi d. 170 CE . Mathematical treatises included the Book on Numbers and Computation Suan shu shu The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven Zhoubi Suanjing , and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art Jiuzhang Suanshu . There were also works on astronomy, such as the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images Tianwen qixiang zazhan from the 2nd century BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts and Zhang Heng's 78139 CE Spiritual Constitution of the Universe Lingxian published in 120 CE. Aside from the biographies found in the Standard Histories, it became popular amongst gentrymen to write stylistic essays and commission private biographies on other gentlemen. These privately published biographies focused either on gentrymen from one's locality or more well known figures who held national prominence. The rhapsody, known as fu in Chinese, was a new literary genre. The poet and official Sima Xiangru 179117 BCE wrote several rhapsodies, yet his largest and most influential was the Rhapsody on the Son of Heaven on a Leisurely Hunt Tianzi Youlie Fu written in debate form. Sima's rhapsodies incorporated literary elements found in the Songs of Chuan anthology of poems attributed to Qu Yuan 340278 BCE and Song Yu fl. 3rd century BCE such as flying with heavenly immortals. Yang Xiong was the other prominent fu writer of Western Han, and although he at first praised Sima's work, he later criticized it as an example of the genre's shortcomings. In Eastern Han, Ban Gu wrote a rhapsody comparing the capital cities Chang'an and Luoyang, in which he concluded that Luoyang was the better of the two which was a subtle praise of the current emperor, hinting that his virtue surpassed the rulers of Western Han . The court astronomer and inventor Zhang Heng 78139 CE also wrote rhapsodies on the capital cities which were inspired by those of Ban Gu. Zhang also penned the rhapsody Returning to the Fields , which fused Daoist and Confucian ideals as well as laid the groundwork for later metaphysical nature poetry. Zhang Heng also wrote Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows , which represent the earliest heptasyllabic shi poems in Chinese literature. The government's Music Bureau also produced folk songs and yuefu, a lyrical form of verse that became a standard subgenre of shi poetry. These poems focused largely on issues of morality that Confucian scholars found acceptable and in line with Zhou dynasty traditions. Poets of the Jian'an period 196220 CE usually attended the same social events to compose poems on a given topic in one another's company. By the Han dynasty, written law had matured from its archaic form based largely on natural law and social customs into a rational corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He d. 193 BCE was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin era Shuihudi and Han era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles on the death penalty alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law. The county magistrate and commandery administrator were the official court judges of the county and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first would be the first to judge him or her. If a commandery level court case could not be resolved, the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver. As with previous codes, Han law distinguished what should be considered murderous killings with malice and foresight , wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he was not allowed to mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court. Sometimes criminals were beaten with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han scholars argued that torture was not the best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be so as not to cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's r. 154141 BCE reign which decreased the number of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder. Although modern scholars know of some surviving cases where Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade outside the monopolies and the family were still largely governed by age old social customs. Many ways in which family relations were conducted during the Han were already stipulated in the ancient Confucian canon, especially in the Book of Rites. This became accepted as the mainstream guide to ethics and custom. In terms of private commercial contracts, they usually entailed information on the goods transferred, the amount paid, the names of the buyer and seller, the date of transfer and the signatures of witnesses. Artists were classified as artisans since they were nonagricultural laborers who manufactured and decorated objects. The philosopher Wang Fu argued that urban society exploited the contributions of food producing farmers while able bodied men in the cities wasted their time among other listed pursuits crafting miniature plaster carts, earthenware statues of dogs, horses, and human figures of singers and actors, and children's toys. However, during Eastern Han some scholar officials began engaging in crafts originally reserved for artisans, such as mechanical engineering. Emperor Ling commissioned the official Cai Yong 132192 CE to paint portraits and produce eulogies for five generations of the prominent Yang clan of officials and military officers. This is the first recorded instance in China where a scholar official was commissioned to write eulogies and paint portraits in conjunction, instead of relying on skilled artisans to do the painting. Han luxury items furnished the homes of wealthy merchants, officials, nobles, and royalty. Such goods were often highly decorated by skilled artisans. These include red and black lacquerwares in various shapes and sizes, bronze items such as raised relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps in the shape of human figures, and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic wares with various incised designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, quartz, gold, and silver. Besides domestic decoration, Han artwork also served an important funerary function. Han artists and craftsmen decorated the wall bricks lining underground tombs of the deceased with mural paintings and carved reliefs the purpose of this artwork was to aid the deceased in traveling through their afterlife journey. Stamping artistic designs into tile and brick was also common. Human figurine sculptures found in Han tombs were placed there to perform various functions for the deceased in the afterlife, such as dancing and playing music for entertainment, as well as serving food. A common type of ceramic figurine found in Han tombs is a female entertainer sporting long, flowing silk sleeves that are flung about while dancing. Some ceramic human figuresboth male and femalehave been found naked, all with clearly distinguished genitalia and missing arms. This is because they once had wooden or cloth arms which were attached to holes in the shoulders by pegs, as well as miniature clothes made of perishable materials such as silk. During the Western Han, grave goods were usually wares and pieces of art that were used by the tomb occupant when he or she was alive. By the Eastern Han, new stylistic goods, wares, and artwork found in tombs were usually made exclusively for burial and were not produced for previous use by the deceased when they were alive. These include miniature ceramic towersusually watchtowers and urban residential towerswhich provide historians clues about lost wooden architecture. In addition to towers, there are also miniature models of querns, water wells, pigsties, pestling shops, and farm fields with pottery pigs, dogs, sheep, chickens, ducks. Although many items placed in tombs were commonly used wares and utensils, it was considered taboo to bring objects specified for burial into living quarters or the imperial palace. They could only be brought into living quarters once they were properly announced at funerary ceremonies, and were known as mingqi fearsome artifacts, objects for the dead, or brilliant artifacts . The most common agricultural food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, the roots of lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume , melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beerwhich could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeastwas commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed. The 2nd century BCE tomb of the Lady Dai contained not only decayed remnants of actual food, such as rice, wheat, barley, two varieties of millet, and soybeans, but also a grave inventory with recipes on it. This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt. Recipes in the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings. Like their modern counterparts, the Han era Chinese used chopsticks as eating utensils. For drinking beverages, wealthy people during Han often used cups with golden handles and inlaid with silver. For the poor, hemp was the common item used to make clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, double layered robes, single layered robes, single layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno or gauze weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes. Families throughout Han China made ritual sacrifices usually involving animals and foodstuffs to various deities, spirits, and ancestors. Deceased ancestors were thought to require food and drink in the afterlife, so living family members were routinely obligated to offer food and wine to the ancestors in a family shrine or temple. Wealthy families who could afford to bury their dead in large tombs often placed the food items at the entrances of such complexes. Han era Chinese believed that a person had two souls, the hun and po. The spirit soul hun was believed to travel to the paradise of the immortals xian while the body soul po remained on earth in its proper resting place so long as measures were taken to prevent it from wandering to the netherworld. The body soul could allegedly utilize items placed in the tomb of the deceased, such as domestic wares, clothes, food and utensils, and even money in the form of clay replicas. It was believed that the bipartite souls could also be temporarily reunited in a ceremony called summoning the hun to return to the po zhao hun fu po . However, Han beliefs in the afterlife were not uniform across the empire and changed over time. Not only were there many different burial customs and views on how one journeyed through the afterlife, but even the names hun and po for spirit soul and body soul could be substituted with demon gui and spirit shen . Demons, or gui, were thought to be partial manifestations of the deceased which lacked their essential vital energy qi that had to be exorcised when they maliciously caused the living to become ill however, a demon could also be considered a neutral 'ghost'. Spirits, or shen, were usually associated with the animalistic spirits embodying certain places, such as the Earl of the Yellow River He Bo . If proper sacrifices were made to these spirits, it was believed to bring good fortune if ritual sacrifices were neglected, the spirit could inflict bad fortune on individuals and local communities. In the Western Han, texts left behind in tombs illustrate that the living took a more sympathetic view towards the dead than in the Eastern Han, when spirits were generally more feared as dangers to the living. The Western Han 'letters informing the underground' gaodishu were written to 'inform the Ruler of the Underground' about the deceased's wants and needs for clothing, vessels, and implements. However, 'tomb quelling texts' zhenmuwen that appeared during the 1st century CE acted as passports for the dead so that they did not disturb or bring danger to the living. Both Western Han and Eastern Han tombs contained 'land contracts' diquan which stated that the deceased owned the land they were buried in. Since the emperor fulfilled the role of the highest priest in the land, he was obligated to offer ritual sacrifices to Heaven, the supreme deities, and spirits of the mountains and rivers. The Qin court had made sacrifices to and worshipped four main deities, to which Emperor Gaozu added one in 205 BCE to make Five Powers Wudi . However, Emperor Cheng r. 337 BCE cancelled state worship of the Five Powers in favor of ceremonies dedicated to Heaven Tian and the supreme god Shangdi , who the kings of the Zhou dynasty c. 1050 256 BCE had worshipped and traced their legitimacy to. One of the underlying reasons for this shift in state policy was Emperor Cheng's desire to gain Heaven's direct favor and thus become blessed with a male heir. The court's exclusive worship of Heaven continued throughout the rest of Han. The Han Chinese believed that three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were inextricably linked and subject to natural cycles if man could understand these cycles, they could understand the hidden secrets of the three realms. One cycle was yin and yang, which corresponded to yielding and hard, shade and sunlight, feminine and masculine, and the Moon and Sun, respectively, while it was thought to govern the three realms and changing of seasons. The five phases was another important cycle where the elements of wood mu , fire huo , earth tu , metal jin , and water shui succeeded each other in rotation and each corresponded with certain traits of the three realms. For example, the five phases corresponded with other sets of five like the five organs i.e. liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys and five tastes i.e. sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty , or even things like feelings, musical notes, colors, planets, calendars and time periods. It was accepted during the Qin dynasty that whoever defeated his rivals in battle would have legitimacy to rule the land. Yet by the time of Wang Mang's usurpation it was commonly believed that Heaven, which was now given greater prominence in state worship, designated which individual and hereditary house had the right to rule, a concept known as the Mandate of Heaven. Michael Loewe retired professor from the University of Cambridge writes that this is consistent with the gradually higher level of emphasis given to the cosmic elements of Five Phases, which were linked with the future destiny of the dynasty and its protection. Dong Zhongshu stressed that a ruler who behaved immorally and did not adhere to proper conduct created a disruption in the natural cycles governing the three realms, which resulted in natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts. This idea became fully accepted at court and in later dynasties , as emperors often implemented reforms to the legal system or granted amnesties to restore nature's balance. At the beginning of the Han dynasty, the Liu family associated its dynasty with the water phase as the previous Qin dynasty had done. By 104 BCE, to accompany the installment of the new Taichu Calendar , the Han court aligned itself with the earth phase to legitimately supplant the Qin's element. Yet by 26 CE shortly after the downfall of Wang Mang the new Eastern Han court made a retrospective argument that Han's element had always been fire. After Huang Lao thought became eclipsed by other ideologies explaining the cosmos during the 2nd century BCE, the sage philosopher Laozi replaced the Yellow Emperor as the ancestor and originator of the teachings of Daoism. As written by Wang Chong in the 1st century CE, Daoists were chiefly concerned with obtaining immortality. Valerie Hansen writes that Han era Daoists were organized into small groups of people who believed that individual immortality could be obtained through breathing exercises, sexual techniques, and medical potions. However, these were the same practices of Daoists who followed Zhuangzi fl. 4th century BCE centuries before. The Han era Chinese believed that the Queen Mother of the West ruled over a mountainous realm of immortal semi human creatures who possessed elixirs of immortality that man could utilize to prolong his life. Besides the Queen Mother's mountain to the west, Mount Penglai in the east was another mythological location where the Han era Chinese believed one could achieve immortality. Wang Chong stated that Daoists, organized into small groups of hermits largely unconcerned with the wider laity, believed they could attempt to fly to the lands of the immortals and become invincible pure men. His criticism of such groups is the best known source of his century to describe Daoist beliefs. However, a major transformation in Daoist beliefs occurred in the 2nd century CE, when large hierarchical religious societies formed and viewed Laozi as a deity and prophet who would usher in salvation for his followers. The first mentioning of Buddhism in China occurred in 65 CE. This was in regards to Liu Ying d. 71 CE , a half brother of Emperor Ming, who allegedly paid homage to the Buddha. At this point, the Chinese heavily associated Buddhism with Huang Lao Daoism. Emperor Ming also had the first known Buddhist temple constructed in China, the White Horse Temple of Luoyang. It was allegedly built in honor of the foreign monks Jiashemoteng Kasyapa Matanga and Zhu Falan Dharmaratna the Indian . A popular myth asserted that these two monks were the first to translate the Sutra of Forty two Chapters into Chinese, although it is now known that this work was not translated into Chinese until the 2nd century CE. The Parthian monk An Shigao from the Parthian Empire came to Han China in 148 CE. He translated Buddhist works on the Hinayana into Chinese, as well as works on yoga that Han era Chinese associated with Daoist exercises. Another foreign monk, Lokaksema from Kushan era Gandhara, India, traveled and stayed in Han China from around 178198 CE. He translated the Perfection of Wisdom, Shurangama Sutra, and Pratyutpanna Sutra, and introduced to China the concepts of Akshobhya Buddha, Amitabha Buddha of Pure Land Buddhism , and teachings about Manjusri. The Daoist religious society of the Five Pecks of Rice was initiated by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE. Zhang was raised in what is now Jiangsu where he studied Daoist beliefs in immortality. He moved to what is now Sichuan province and claimed to have a revelation where the deified Laozi appointed him as his earthly representative and Celestial Master. The movement spread rapidly, particularly under Zhang's sons, Zhang Heng and Zhang Lu. Instead of money, followers were asked to contribute five pecks of rice to the religious society and banned the worship of 'unclean' gods who accepted sacrificial offerings of meat. Initiated members of the group were called 'libationers', a title associated with village elders who took the first drink at feasts. The laity were told that if they obeyed the rules of the religious society, they would be rewarded with good health. Illness was thus seen as the result of violating religious rules and committing personal sins, which required confession to libationers charged with overseeing the recovery of sinners. They believed that chanting parts of the Daodejing would bring about cures for illnesses. Zhang Daoling's second successor Zhang Lu initiated a rebellion in 184 CE that allowed him to retain complete control over Ba and Hanzhong commanderies of modern Sichuan and southern Shanxi for three decades. He even modelled his 'charity houses' after Han postal stations, yet his establishments offered grain and meat to followers. Although Zhang Lu surrendered to Chancellor Cao Cao 155220 CE in 215 CE, Cao was still wary of his influence over the people, so he granted Zhang and his sons fiefs to placate them. The widespread Yellow Turban Rebellion also occurred in 184 CE, its leaders claiming that they were destined to bring about a utopian era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness was a sign of wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a ramification for sickness if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first and very auspicious year of a new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's supreme leader Zhang Jue d. 184 CE chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By the end of the year their leadershipincluding Zhang Juehad been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society%20and%20culture%20of%20the%20Han%20dynasty
"The Society for Human Rights was an American LGBT Rights organization established in Chicago in 1924. Society founder Henry Gerber was inspired to create it by the work of German doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and the Scientific Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter from the state of Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased to exist in the wake of the arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement. Henry Gerber emigrated from Imperial Germany in 1913, settling with his family in Chicago because of its large German speaking population. Within a few years of his arrival he experienced discrimination based on his sexual orientation when he was temporarily committed to a mental institution in 1917 for being homosexual. With the United States's entry into World War I, Gerber enlisted in the United States Army. After the war, he served as a printer and proofreader with the Allied Army of Occupation in Coblenz, Germany, from 1920 to 1923. During his time in Germany, Gerber learned about Magnus Hirschfeld and the work he and his Scientific Humanitarian Committee were doing to reform anti homosexual German law, especially Paragraph 175, which criminalized sex between men. Gerber traveled to Berlin, which supported a thriving gay subculture, on several occasions and subscribed to at least one homophile magazine. Gerber marveled at the development of the gay community in Berlin and later wrote I had always bitterly felt the injustice with which my own American society accused the homosexual of 'immoral acts.' What could be done about it, I thought. Unlike Germany, where the homosexual was partially organized and where sex legislation was uniform for the whole country, the United States was in a condition of chaos and misunderstanding concerning its sex laws, and no one was trying to unravel the tangle and bring relief to the abused. He was particularly impressed with the work of a group called Bund fur Menschenrechte Association for Human Rights and absorbed a number of Hirschfeld's ideas, including the notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate. Following his military service, Gerber returned to the United States and went to work for the post office in Chicago. Inspired by Hirschfeld's work with the Scientific Humanitarian Committee, Gerber resolved to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights the English translation of Bund fur Menschenrecht and took on the role of secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter. The society's newsletter, Friendship and Freedom, was the first gay interest publication in the United States. However, few Society members were willing to receive mailings of the newsletter, fearing that postal inspectors would deem the publication obscene under the Comstock Act. Indeed, all gay interest publications were deemed obscene until 1958, when the Supreme Court ruled in One, Inc. v. Olesen that publishing homosexual content did not mean the content was automatically obscene. Two issues of Friendship and Freedom were written and produced, entirely by Gerber. No copies of the newsletter are known to exist. Gerber formulated a three point strategy for winning what he referred to as homosexual emancipation Gerber set out to expand the Society's membership beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support of people in the medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blase. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals. Gerber and Graves decided to limit Society membership to gay men and exclude bisexuals. Unknown to them, the Society's vice president Al Weininger, a man Gerber described as an indigent laundry queen , was married with two children. Weininger's wife reported the Society to a social worker in the summer of 1925, calling them degenerates and making claims of strange doings in front of her children. The police broke in on Gerber in the middle of the night with a reporter from the Chicago Examiner in tow, interrogated him, seized his personal papers and arrested him. The next morning, Gerber arrived in court to learn that Graves, Weininger and Weininger's male companion had also been arrested. The Examiner reported the story under the headline Strange Sex Cult Exposed . The paper erroneously reported that Weininger and other members of the Society had performed sex acts in front of Weininger's children and that Society literature encouraged men to abandon their wives and children. This latter statement was in direct contradiction to the Society's policy of only admitting men who were exclusively homosexual. Gerber was put through three separate trials, before charges against him were finally dismissed because he was arrested without a warrant. Gerber's defense cost him his life savings, some of which may have been in the form of bribes paid through his lawyer. The police never returned Gerber's personal papers, his typewriter or his remaining copies of Friendship and Freedom despite a court order compelling their return. The only concrete record of the newsletter's existence is a photograph of one issue in a German homophile magazine and a review of the issue in a French homophile publication. Although Gerber avoided prosecution for obscenity under the Comstock Act, he lost his post office job for conduct unbecoming a postal worker . Weininger paid a 10 fine 133 in 2013 dollars for disorderly conduct . With Gerber feeling he had hit a solid wall of ignorance, hypocrisy, meanness and corruption and unable to continue his financial support, the Society dismantled, and Gerber was left embittered that none of the wealthier gays of Chicago had come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance the common good. He left Chicago for New York City, where he re enlisted in the Army, serving for 17 years before being honorably discharged. Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights serve as direct links between the LGBT related activism of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, a young man named Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, a man who had been a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States. Gerber was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1992. The Henry Gerber House, located at 1710 N. Crilly Court, Chicago, contains the apartment in which Gerber lived when he founded the Society. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 1, 2001. In June 2015 it was named a National Historic Landmark. The Gerber Hart Library at 6500 N. Clark St in Chicago is named in honor of Gerber and early civil rights defender Pearl M. Hart.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society%20for%20Human%20Rights

Megan decides that the only way to confront Colin is to accept her mother's invitation, which she had previously declined, as Colin is attending and after questioning him, she rules him out as a suspect. Curtis confirms that the maggots that he was testing take around two days to mature, so Curtis confirms that Daphne was dead for two days before the body was found.

"Sociobiology The New Synthesis 1975 25th anniversary edition 2000 is a book by the biologist E. O. Wilson. It helped start the sociobiology debate, one of the great scientific controversies in biology of the 20th century and part of the wider debate about evolutionary psychology and the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology. Wilson popularized the term sociobiology as an attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviour such as altruism, aggression, and the nurturing of the young. It formed a position within the long running nature versus nurture debate. The fundamental principle guiding sociobiology is that an organism's evolutionary success is measured by the extent to which its genes are represented in the next generation. The book was generally well reviewed in biological journals. It received a much more mixed reaction among sociologists, mainly triggered by the brief coverage of the implications of sociobiology for human society in the first and last chapters of the book the body of the text was largely welcomed. A review reached the front page of the New York Times, such was the level of interest in the debate. The sociologist Gerhard Lenski, admitting that sociologists needed to look further into non human societies, agreed that human society was founded on biology but denied both biological reductionism and determinism. Lenski observed that since the nature nurture dichotomy was false, there was no reason for sociologists and biologists to disagree. Other sociologists objected in particular to the final chapter, on Man Devra G. Kleiman called Wilson's attempt to extend his thesis to humans weak and premature, and noted that he had largely overlooked the importance of co operative behaviour and females in mammalian societies. E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in the study of ants, social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his pioneering work on island biogeography, which relates species richness to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co operation in social animals. The book was first published in 1975. It has been reprinted at least 14 times up to 2014. It has been translated into languages including Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish. An abridged edition was published in 1980. The book is illustrated with 31 halftone figures, 209 line drawings by Sarah Landry, and 43 tables. The drawings of animal societies were considered informing and attractive . The section summarizes the concepts of population genetics, a branch of evolutionary theory combining Mendelian genetics and natural selection in mathematical form to explain the pressures on animal societies. In particular, altruism, self sacrificing behaviour, would die out unless something such as kin or group selection maintains it. This section describes the types of social behaviour in animals, including the principles of animal communication, aggression, dominance systems, and insect castes. The section describes the distribution of social behaviour in different taxa. The theme is that evolution is progressive, with four pinnacles of social evolution, namely the colonial invertebrates such as corals, the social insects, mammals other than humans, and finally humans. The last chapter argues that natural selection has made humans far more flexible in social organisation than any other species. Sociobiology attracted a large number of critical reviews, not only by biologists, but by social scientists who objected especially to Wilson's application of Darwinian thinking to humans, asserting that Wilson was implying a form of biological determinism. It was, unusually, reviewed on the front page of the New York Times in May 1975, and again in November that year as the controversy grew. The paper described the effect as a period of ferment , naming the monumental book as the yeast . The Times noted that the debate was an updated version of the nature or nurture argument that had simmered ever since Darwin's time The assertion that man's body is a biological machine, subject to biological rules, has never completely shaken the conviction that the human intellect and human behavior are unique, the subject of free will. The paper reported that Wilson's colleague at Harvard, Richard Lewontin, had issued a 5,000 word attack on the book, and that the meticulous Wilson had said I've tried to be extremely cautious in all this . The paper noted that Wilson had nowhere actually said that human behaviour was totally determined by genes, and reported him as saying that a rough figure was 10 percent genetic. The theoretical biologist Mary Jane West Eberhard reviewed the book in detail for The Quarterly Review of Biology as a work of special significance . She began it with a fable of a small community of modest scholars called natural historians who all practised their own sciences, until one day a man who had been called Entomologist, Ecologist, and even Biochemist arose among them and pronounced there shall be a new science . She wrote that Wilson had assumed god like powers with this book , attempting to reformulate the foundations of the social sciences, making ethology and comparative psychology obsolete, and restructuring behavioural biology. She marvelled at the sustained enthusiasm and authoritativeness across a wide range of fields not Wilson's own, and the usefulness of many of the chapters. In this book sociobiology is a patchwork neatly stitched from relevant pieces of other fields, without a bold new theoretical pattern of its own . She objected strongly to what she considered Wilson's confused and misleading discussion of altruism and group selection, arguing that kin selection provided an alternative fully Darwinian explanation and that Wilson was wrong to make it seem that group selection was necessary. Charles D. Michener, an entomologist, reviewed the book for BioScience. He observed that its scope was far wider than the social insects of Wilson's previous book The Insect Societies, dealing with social phenomena from the slime molds to man . He found the review of population biology Part I excellent. He noted Wilson's statement that altruism is the central problem of sociobiology, and remarks that Wilson's account in fact indicates the solution, kin selection. He describes the chapter on Man as being from the viewpoint of a very knowledgeable extraterrestrial visitor recording man's social natural history . The ornithologist Herbert Friedmann, reviewing the book for The Journal of Wildlife Management, called the book very important for its coverage of topics including of humans, and its interpretive attitude . It would be a convenient summary of any of the groups it covers for the student, and the question of bio ethics of interest to every intelligent biologist . Friedmann noted that Wilson has the courage of his convictions to suggest in the chapter on Man that human ethics and morality should be expressed biologically rather than philosophically , something that need not deter the zoologist since in Friedmann's view ethics does not exist in the human sense in the nonhuman world . David Barash, a psychologist, thought it about time students of behaviour were finally becoming Darwinian, starting to turn the ramshackle science into something with firmer intellectual foundations. He defended sociobiology, arguing that it does not claim that genes somehow control behaviour, but that they along with experience and culture contribute to it. He speculated that it might be possible to make valid predictions about human behaviour by studying cross cultural universals in human behaviour , combining anthropology and evolutionary biology's theorem of fitness maximization. The sociologist Eileen Barker reviewed the book for The British Journal of Sociology. She called it an impressive tome it weighs 5 lb and a comprehensive, beautifully laid out and illustrated reference book covering the amazing variety of animal social behaviour . She noted that the final section on Man contained several surprises for most sociologists , and that the book should counter many of the naive inferences that have recently been made about man's evolutionary heritage. Marion Blute, in Contemporary Sociology, noted that it was rare for any book to be reviewed on the front page of the New York Times, or to receive the extremes of reaction seen for Sociobiology. She found that the clarity, breadth and richness of accurately rendered detail in this monograph is really quite breath taking. However, she objected to the claim that the book covered the biological basis of all social behaviour, as it did not cover what she called the epigenetic disciplines , the effects of the environment on the embryonic and later development of the individual including learning nurture, not just nature . She called the gap unfortunate and pointed out that the development problem and the functioning of the human brain were the frontiers of research. She observed, citing Dobzhansky, that an evolutionary minded sociology which really appreciated the significance of sociocultural transmission along nongenetic lines would likely see society and culture in a very different way . Despite Wilson's neglect of epigenetic and social sciences, she urged sociologists to read this exceptionally fine book , noting that despite its length it should have been twice as long. She looked forward to seeing sociology coming to terms with the neo Darwinian synthesis, something that was already under way, which she argued would enrich social theory, a much better result than the alternative possibility, a renewed waste of time on the nature versus nurture debate. Gerhard Lenski, in Social Forces, admitted that sociologists had too often ignored non human societies, and thought the book should be required reading. Human societies were plainly founded on biology, but this did not imply either biological reductionism or determinism. Comparison with other species would be productive, as nonhuman societies often had traditions handed down from one generation to the next, such as the flyways of migratory birds or dietary patterns among primates . Issues of conflict and cooperation were similarly illuminated. But in his view the book raised uncomfortable issues . The first chapter could sound, he argued, like intellectual imperialism as Wilson called sociology an essentially nontheoretical, descriptive science, not unlike taxonomy and ecology forty years ago, before they were 'reshaped entirely ... neo Darwinian evolutionary theory' . Lenski however took Wilson more openly than that, noting Wilson's precursors, Julian Huxley, George Gaylord Simpson, Dobzhansky and others of the modern synthesis. They had tried repeatedly to talk to sociologists, and in Lenski's view that remained necessary. Further, he suggested, the nature nurture dichotomy was evidently false, so there was no reason for sociologists and biologists to disagree. In his view, continued rejection of biology by sociologists only invited a reductionist response on the part of biologists. Lenski found the final chapter on Man disappointing , as Wilson had been unable to penetrate the barriers put up by social science against the modern synthesis, and Wilson's overestimation of the influence of genetics compared to culture and technology on human society. All the same, Lenski thought these flaws could be mended by dialogue between sociology and biology. Allan Mazur reviewed the book for the American Journal of Sociology. He called it an excellent and comprehensive survey, and said he found very few errors, though for instance squirrel monkeys did have dominance hierarchies. But he found the chapter on Man disappointing it was trite, value loaded, or wrong used data uncritically, and seemed to be based on Gerhard and Jean Lenski's introductory textbook . Further, he agreed with Wilson that scientific theories must be falsifiable, and stated I claim that the bulk of Wilson's theorizing is not falsifiable and therefore is of little value. This was because Wilson's theorizing was sometimes tautologous, sometimes hopelessly vague, and sometimes based on unobservable past events. For instance, Mazur argued that Wilson's claim that altruism has evolved in most social species is untestable Mazur denied that a mother's action to save her baby is altruistic, as by kin selection it increases her own fitness. However, Mazur was glad that Wilson has legitimate the biological approach to sociology , even if other books like Robert Hinde's 1974 Biological Bases of Human Social Behaviour were of more use to sociologists. Devra G. Kleiman reviewed the work for Signs. She called it a remarkable attempt to explain the evolution of social behavior and social systems in animals by a synthesis of several disciplines within biology , but noted that it had been severely criticised by some biologists and social scientists. She observed that it gives less attention to the environmental control of behavior than to genetics. But Wilson's ultimate sin was to include the final chapter, unfortunately titled 'Man' , attracting the wrath of those who would deny the influence of biology on human behavior because of its political and social connotations. She called this a pity, since while his attempt to include humans in his analysis was admittedly weak and premature , the general principles were correct for instance, she argued, it was useful to know the genetic relatedness of individuals when assessing social interactions. She considered Wilson nonrigorous and biased in his application of theory in certain areas . His biases included over representation of insects, genetics, and the dominance of male mammals over females Wilson had further exaggerated a bias from an ethology literature written mainly by males. Conversely, he had undervalued co operative behaviour among mammals, except where it concerned males, ignoring the fact that, Kleiman argued, genetically related females were the core of most mammal societies. Wilson's book was in her view valuable as a framework for future research, but premature as a Synthesis . The philosopher of politics Roger D. Masters reviewed the book for the American Political Science Review, stating that it was impossible both to review the book and not to do so, given the attention it had received. In his view, the book has the indisputable merit of showing that the existence of complex societies is a biological phenomenon. By emphasizing the relationships between animal behavior and population genetics, Wilson compels us to recognize the evolutionary significance of events which social scientists often treat without reference to Darwinian biology. But there was a large gap between that and the work of most political scientists, and it was too early to attempt to apply sociobiology directly to human social issues in practice. He concluded that the book was fascinating, provocative, and the start of a return to the tradition as old as Aristotle where man is seen as a 'political animal' , since social behaviour had natural origins. Philip L. Wagner, a geographer reviewing the book in Annals of the Association of American Geographers, argued that the book proposes a fundamental thesis for explaining the size, structure, and spatial arrangements of animal populations, all aspects of geography, and noted that Wilson and MacArthur's 1967 Theory of Island Biogeography had already set out some of these ideas. In his view, the most impressive aspect of the book was its mission to extend rational deterministic explanation far more widely. However, he thought the last chapter, extending the ideas to humans, far too brief and premature, as it failed to cover technology or tradition in general, while Wilson's speculations about tradition drift elsewhere in the book reinvented the study of diffusion of innovations and appeared unaware of the now classical Hagerstrand diffusion models. The biology teacher Lotte R. Geller, reviewing the book in The American Biology Teacher, thought the book meticulously researched no one would take exception to its thesis, but for the inclusion of man. is well aware of the difficulties this presents. Geller called the last chapter, relating biology to sociology, a step from scientific study to speculation . In her view, the most controversial and disturbing thing was the call for scientist and humanists to temporarily remove ethics from the hands of the philosophers and biologize it. She called it dangerous to say that biologists should have a monopoly on truth and ethics. The anthropologist Frances L. Stewart, writing in the Bulletin of the Canadian Archaeological Association, noted that An anthropologist reading this book is confronted by statements which contradict anthropological theory. The main argument that all social behavior has a biological basis would be questioned. The application of sociobiology to humans discussed only in the first and last chapters of the book was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social Darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas. Other critics believed that Wilson's theories, as well as the works of subsequent admirers, were not supported scientifically. Objections were raised to many of the ethnocentric assumptions of early sociobiology like ignoring female gatherers in favour of male hunters in hunter gatherer societies and to the sampling and mathematical methods used in informing conclusions. Many of Wilson's less well supported conclusions were attacked for example, Wilson's mathematical treatment of inheritance as involving a single gene per trait, even though he admitted that traits could be polygenic . Sociobiologists were accused of being super adaptationists, or panadaptationist, believing that every aspect of morphology and behaviour must necessarily be an evolutionarily beneficial adaptation. Philosophical debates about the nature of scientific truth and the applicability of any human reason to a subject so complex as human behaviour, considering past failures, raged. Describing the controversy, Eric Holtzmans noted that Given the baleful history of misuse of biology in justifying or designing social policies and practices, authors who attempt to consider human sociobiology have special responsibilities that are not adequately discharged by the usual academic caveats. Wilson and his admirers countered these criticisms by saying that Wilson had no political agenda, and if he had one it was certainly not authoritarian, citing Wilson's environmentalism in particular. They argued that they as scientists had a duty to uncover the truth whether that was politically correct or not. Wilson called the claim that sociobiology is biological determinism academic vigilantism and the Sociobiology Study Group response a largely ideological argument . Noam Chomsky, a linguist and political scientist, surprised many by coming to the defense of sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature in order to be able to struggle for a better society, claiming that leaders should know what human needs were in order to build a better society. With the publication of the 25th anniversary edition in 2000, the historians of biology Michael Yudell and Rob Desalle reviewed the nature nurture controversy around the book. Once again , they wrote, biological reductionism and genetic determinism became the focus of rancorous debates, discussions and diatribes within both academia and popular culture. They pointed out that the quest for a sociobiologization of biology was not new, mentioning Darwin's The Descent of Man, R.A. Fisher, and Julian Huxley, all touching on the biological basis of human society, followed by Konrad Lorenz, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey in the 1960s, and Richard Dawkins and David Barash in the 1970s. Wilson's choice of title echoed the modern synthesis named by Huxley in 1942 and, the reviewers argued, meant to build upon and extend it. 25 years on, they noted, most of the discord had gone, and the discipline had been renamed as evolutionary psychology they were surprised to find that Wilson was happy with that, and they called the new discipline pop psychology for people who like telling just so stories . Concerning the anniversary edition, Yudell and Desalle thought it strange that nothing worth adding had happened in 25 years the book remained a primary text, and Wilson's failure to develop it weakened the edition's impact. The early chapters still seemed a lucid and engaging introduction to population biology, but much of the rest seemed after 25 years to lack methodological breadth , given that it did not cover the new fields that had emerged while barely mentioning the growing importance of phylogenetic systematics seemed curious . They pointed out that comparing human and animal social evolution is tantamount to making homology claims, but Wilson had said nothing about the need for a methodology to test behavioural homology. The reviewers were also troubled by Wilson's attitude to the debate, remaining contemptuous of his anti sociobiological opposition and opprobrium towards Marxism especially Gould and Lewontin . Yudell and Desalle noted the irony that Wilson despised Marxism but advocated an aggressive paradigm ... seeking to blaze an historical path towards the future as Marxism did . They argued that by demonising his opponents in this way, Wilson created support for Sociobiology not necessarily sustainable by his data and methodologies. He was still doing that 25 years on, stated the reviewers. An extensive account of the controversy around the book was published at the same time as the new edition, largely supporting Wilson's views. Looking back at Sociobiology 35 years later, the philosopher of biology Michael Ruse called the book a pretty remarkable achievement of huge scope, firmly in the Darwinian paradigm of evolution through natural selection . He found one aspect of the book very peculiar in its metaphysical underpinning , namely that Wilson was committed to the idea of progress in biology, the idea that organic life has proceeded from the very simple to the very complex, from the value free to the value laden, from as they used to say in the 19th century the monad to the man. Ruse observed that while producing humans might look like progress, evolution had also produced smallpox and syphilis and potato blight, raising serious doubts about whether evolution is progressive. Ruse noted that Gould's 1989 book Wonderful Life was entirely an attack on this idea of progress.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociobiology%3A%20The%20New%20Synthesis
"Sociology is the study of society, patterns of social relationships, social interaction and culture of everyday life. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change or social evolution. Sociology is also defined as the general science of society. While some sociologists conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure. The different traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality, gender, and deviance. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as health, medical, economy, military and penal institutions, the Internet, education, social capital, and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge. The range of social scientific methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid 20th century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent based modelling and social network analysis. Social research informs politicians and policy makers, educators, planners, legislators, administrators, developers, business magnates, managers, social workers, non governmental organizations, non profit organizations, and people interested in resolving social issues in general. There is often a great deal of crossover between social research, market research, and other statistical fields. Sociological reasoning predates the foundation of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from as far back as the time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey the collection of information from a sample of individuals can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote about the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa Tunisia , to have been the first sociologist and the father of sociology see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict. The word sociology or sociologie is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The Latin word socius, companion the suffix logy, the study of from Greek from , logos, word , knowledge . It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes 17481836 in an unpublished manuscript. Sociology was later defined independently by the French philosopher of science, Auguste Comte 17981857 in 1838 as a new way of looking at society. Comte had earlier used the term social physics, but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology, and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the French Revolution, he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism, an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy 18301842 and A General View of Positivism 1848 . Comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era, after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases, in the progression of human understanding. In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comte gave a powerful impetus to the development of sociology, an impetus which bore fruit in the later decades of the nineteenth century. To say this is certainly not to claim that French sociologists such as Durkheim were devoted disciples of the high priest of positivism. But by insisting on the irreducibility of each of his basic sciences to the particular science of sciences which it presupposed in the hierarchy and by emphasizing the nature of sociology as the scientific study of social phenomena Comte put sociology on the map. To be sure, beginnings can be traced back well beyond Montesquieu, for example, and to Condorcet, not to speak of Saint Simon, Comte's immediate predecessor. But Comte's clear recognition of sociology as a particular science, with a character of its own, justified Durkheim in regarding him as the father or founder of this science, in spite of the fact that Durkheim did not accept the idea of the three states and criticized Comte's approach to sociology. Both Auguste Comte and Karl Marx 18181883 set out to develop scientifically justified systems in the wake of European industrialization and secularization, informed by various key movements in the philosophies of history and science. Marx rejected Comtean positivism but in attempting to develop a science of society nevertheless came to be recognized as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning. For Isaiah Berlin, Marx, even though he did not consider himself to be a sociologist, may be regarded as the true father of modern sociology, in so far as anyone can claim the title. To have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principal achievement of Marx's theory. The sociological treatment of historical and moral problems, which Comte and after him, Spencer and Taine, had discussed and mapped, became a precise and concrete study only when the attack of militant Marxism made its conclusions a burning issue, and so made the search for evidence more zealous and the attention to method more intense. Herbert Spencer 27 April 1820 8 December 1903 was one of the most popular and influential 19th century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including Emile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's Division of Labour in Society is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable biologist, Spencer coined the term survival of the fittest. While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a laissez faire style of government. His ideas were closely observed by conservative political circles, especially in the United States and England. The first formal Department of Sociology in the world was established by Albion Small at the invitation of William Rainey Harper at the University of Chicago in 1892, and the American Journal of Sociology was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by Small as well. However, the institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by Emile Durkheim 18581917 , who developed positivism as a foundation for practical social research. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method 1895 . For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning . Durkheim's monograph Suicide 1897 is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists. Suicide is a case study of variations in suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social as opposed to individual or psychological causes. He developed the notion of objective sui generis social facts to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study. Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or social anomie . Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of modernity, such as industrialization, urbanization, secularization, and the process of rationalization . The field predominated in continental Europe, with British anthropology and statistics generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the English speaking world. Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with economics, jurisprudence, psychology and philosophy, with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields. Since its inception, sociological epistemology, methods, and frames of inquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged. Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber 18641920 are typically cited as the three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W.E.B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis de Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tonnies, Georg Simmel, Jane Addams and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure is associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation. Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism for Durkheim it was connected in particular with industrialization and the new social division of labor which this brought about for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation' . Together the works of these great classical sociologists suggest what Giddens has recently described as 'a multidimensional view of institutions of modernity' and which emphasises not only capitalism and industrialism as key institutions of modernity, but also 'surveillance' meaning 'control of information and social supervision' and 'military power' control of the means of violence in the context of the industrialisation of war . The overarching methodological principle of positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology. Our main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct.... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism. The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism. Many of these approaches do not self identify as positivist , some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a pejorative term by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical empiricism. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States. Loic Wacquant distinguishes three major strains of positivism Durkheimian, Logical, and Instrumental. None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid and perhaps optimistic version. While Emile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. He developed the notion of objective sui generis social facts to serve as unique empirical objects for the science of sociology to study. The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns such as the nature of social facts in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism is more or less synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle range theory abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole. Reactions against social empiricism began when German philosopher Hegel voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic. Karl Marx's methodology borrowed from Hegelian dialecticism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of facts with the elimination of illusions. He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Early hermeneuticians such as Wilhelm Dilthey pioneered the distinction between natural and social science 'Geisteswissenschaft' . Various neo Kantian philosophers, phenomenologists and human scientists further theorized how the analysis of the social world differs to that of the natural world due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society, culture, and being. In the Italian context of development of social sciences and of sociology in particular, there are oppositions to the first foundation of the discipline, sustained by speculative philosophy in accordance with the antiscientific tendencies matured by critique of positivism and evolutionism, so a tradition Progressist struggles to establish itself. At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological anti positivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human social action especially among ideal types , or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena. As a non positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as historical, invariant, or generalisable as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tonnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft lit. community and society . Tonnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way pure sociology , whereas the second empirically and inductively applied sociology . ... the science whose object is to interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which the action proceeds and the effects which it produces. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as subjectively meaningful ... the meaning to which we refer may be either a the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or b the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' to be thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of prior discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning. Both Weber and Georg Simmel pioneered the Verstehen or 'interpretative' method in social science a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the phenomenological and existential writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality. His sociology engaged in a neo Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society ' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature ' The deepest problems of modern life flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. The antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality which is connected with the division of labor and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others Nietssche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being leveled, swallowed up in the social technological mechanism. The first college course entitled Sociology was taught in the United States at Yale in 1875 by William Graham Sumner. In 1883 Lester F. Ward, the first president of the American Sociological Association, published Dynamic SociologyOr Applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez faire sociology of Herbert Spencer and Sumner. Ward's 1200 page book was used as core material in many early American sociology courses. In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank W. Blackmar. The Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion Small, who also published the first sociology textbook An introduction to the study of society 1894. George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, who had met at the University of Michigan in 1891 along with John Dewey , would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to social psychology and the symbolic interactionism of the modern Chicago School. The American Journal of Sociology was founded in 1895, followed by the American Sociological Association ASA in 1905. The sociological canon of classics with Durkheim and Max Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences. Parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. Sociology in the United States was less historically influenced by Marxism than its European counterpart, and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach. The first sociology department to be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and Political Science home of the British Journal of Sociology in 1904. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and Edvard Westermarck became the lecturers in the discipline at the University of London in 1907. Harriet Martineau, an English translator of Comte, has been cited as the first female sociologist. In 1909 the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Soziologie German Sociological Association was founded by Ferdinand Tonnies and Max Weber, among others. Weber established the first department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919, having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology. In 1920, Florian Znaniecki set up the first department in Poland. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt later to become the Frankfurt School of critical theory was founded in 1923. International co operation in sociology began in 1893, when Rene Worms founded the Institut International de Sociologie, an institution later eclipsed by the much larger International Sociological Association ISA , founded in 1949. The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi paradigmatic in line with the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominantly from functionalist Durkheim and conflict centred Marx and Weber accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro scale structural Simmel and pragmatist Mead, Cooley theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive. A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and anthropology, functionalism addresses the social structure, referred to as social organization by the classical theorists, as a whole and with respect to the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy popularized by Herbert Spencer is to regard norms and institutions as 'organs' that work towards the proper functioning of the entire 'body' of society. The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronisaw Malinowski and Radcliffe Brown. It is in Radcliffe Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged. Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social evolutionism, in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As Giddens states Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation. functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre eminence of the social world over its individual parts i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects . Functionalist theories emphasize cohesive systems and are often contrasted with conflict theories , which critique the overarching socio political system or emphasize the inequality between particular groups. The following quotes from Durkheim and Marx epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively To aim for a civilisation beyond that made possible by the nexus of the surrounding environment will result in unloosing sickness into the very society we live in. Collective activity cannot be encouraged beyond the point set by the condition of the social organism without undermining health. The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. Symbolic interaction often associated with Interactionism, Phenomenological sociology, Dramaturgy, Interpretivism, is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through micro analysis. This tradition emerged in the Chicago School of the 1920s and 1930s, which prior to World War II had been the center of sociological research and graduate study . The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever changing mosaic of subjective meanings. Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender i.e. social historical structures may have in that situation. Some important sociologists associated with this approach include Max Weber, George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, George Homans and Peter Blau. It is also in this tradition that the radical empirical approach of Ethnomethodology emerges from the work of Harold Garfinkel. Utilitarianism is often referred to as exchange theory or rational choice theory in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self interest. As argued by Josh Whitford, rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has 1 a knowledge of alternatives, 2 a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives, 3 an ordering of preferences over outcomes, 4 A decision rule, to select among the possible alternatives Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of George C. Homans, Peter Blau and Richard Emerson. Organizational sociologists James G. March and Herbert A. Simon noted that an individual's rationality is bounded by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former ASA president James Coleman. Following the decline of theories of sociocultural evolution, in the United States, the interactionism of the Chicago School dominated American sociology. As Anselm Strauss describes, We didn't think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology we thought it was sociology. After World War II, mainstream sociology shifted to the survey research of Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University and the general theorizing of Pitirim Sorokin, followed by Talcott Parsons at Harvard University. Ultimately, the failure of the Chicago, Columbia, and Wisconsin departments to produce a significant number of graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 193645 was to the advantage of the Harvard department. As Parsons began to dominate general theory, his work primarily referenced European sociologyalmost entirely omitting citations of both the American tradition of sociocultural evolution as well as pragmatism. In addition to Parsons' revision of the sociological canon which included Marshall, Pareto, Weber and Durkheim , the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the Parsonian structural functionalist movement, which reached its crescendo in the 1950s, but by the 1960s was in rapid decline. By the 1980s, most functionalisms in Europe had broadly been replaced by conflict oriented approaches and to many in the discipline, functionalism was considered as dead as a dodo. According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy. While some conflict approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically oriented middle range theories with no single overarching, or grand , theoretical orientation. John Levi Martin refers to this golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm as the Pax Wisconsana, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the University of WisconsinMadison numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. Omar Lizardo describes the Pax Wisconsana as a Midwestern flavored, Mertonian resolution of the theory method wars in which all agreed on at least two working hypotheses 1 grand theory is a waste of time 2 good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin. Despite the aversion to grand theory in the latter half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses structuralism, post structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory. The structuralist movement originated primarily from the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Levi Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning. The second tradition of structuralist thought, contemporaneous with Giddens, emerges from the American school of social network analysis, spearheaded by the Harvard Department of Social Relations led by Harrison White and his students in the 1970s and 1980s. This tradition of structuralist thought argues that, rather than semiotics, social structure is networks of patterned social relations. And, rather than Levi Strauss, this school of thought draws on the notions of structure as theorized by Levi Strauss' contemporary anthropologist, Radcliffe Brown. Some refer to this as network structuralism, and equate it to British structuralism as opposed to the French structuralism of Levi Strauss. Post structuralist thought has tended to reject 'humanist' assumptions in the construction of social theory. Michel Foucault provides an important critique in his Archaeology of the Human Sciences, though Habermas and Rorty have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another. The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The anti humanist position has been associated with postmodernism , a term used in specific contexts to describe an era or phenomena, but occasionally construed as a method. Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central problems of sociological theory, which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. This consensus is how to link, transcend or cope with the following big three dichotomies subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, and synchrony and diachrony. The first deals with knowledge, the second with action, and the last with time. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into two parts a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated though not necessarily with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective objective subjective, that is to say how is intersubjectivity achieved While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ. The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialised and led to feel like a fish in water within that social world whose structures she has internalised How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on . Discussions over the primacy of either structure or agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology What is the social world made of , What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect . A perennial question within this debate is that of social reproduction how are structures specifically, structures producing inequality reproduced through the choices of individuals Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of Levi Strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language, while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to Central Problems in Social Theory, he states that, in order to show the interdependence of action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction. And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of social reproduction. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim. Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data. Many people divide sociological research methods into two broad categories, although many others see research methods as a continuum Sociologists are often divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between theory and data. Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States. In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two. Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are qualitative. Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective, and the very term methodology is often used synonymously with statistics. Practically all sociology PhD programmes in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the general public, though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists. The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods as part of a 'multi strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to obtain statistical patterns on a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency. Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling. The following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena. Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, text mining, complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like social network analysis and social sequence analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom up modelling of social interactions. Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science, several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence. By the same token, some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity. Social complexity concepts such as complex systems, non linear interconnection among macro and micro process, and emergence, have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology. A practical and well known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an artificial society , by which researchers can analyse the structure of a social system. Sociologists' approach to culture can be divided into sociology of culture and cultural sociology the terms are similar, though not entirely interchangeable. Sociology of culture is an older term, and considers some topics and objects as more or less cultural than others. Conversely, cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural. Sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena. For Simmel, culture referred to the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history . While early theorists such as Durkheim and Mauss were influential in cultural anthropology, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern rather than primitive or ancient society. Cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and other members of the Frankfurt School. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies. Birmingham School theorists such as Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall questioned the division between producers and consumers evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a subculture such as white working class youth in London would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The cultural turn of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda. Sociology of literature, film, and art is a subset of the sociology of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Regles de L'Art Genese et Structure du Champ Litteraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field 1996 . None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jurgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim. Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, and control of criminal activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both infringements of formally enacted rules e.g., crime and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist how they change over time and how they are enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance. The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the visible symbol of social solidarity. The sociology of law refers to both a sub discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal institutions and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime and that this increase has significantly contributed to the persistence of racial stratification. The sociology of communications and information technologies includes the social aspects of computing, the Internet, new media, computer networks, and other communication and information technologies . The Internet is of interest to sociologists in various ways most practically as a tool for research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense concerns the analysis of online communities e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites and virtual worlds, meaning that there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxythe title of which forms an inter textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty first century. As with cultural studies, media study is a distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though neither the production process nor the critique of aesthetic forms is in the remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often indispensable topic. The term economic sociology was first used by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and modernity as a philosophical concept. The relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism 1905 and Simmel's The Philosophy of Money 1900 . The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as new economic sociology, was consolidated by the 1985 work of Mark Granovetter titled Economic Action and Social Structure The Problem of Embeddedness . This work elaborated the concept of embeddedness, which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part . Social network analysis has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the strength of weak ties and Ronald Burt's concept of structural holes are two of the best known theoretical contributions of this field. The sociology of work, or industrial sociology, examines the direction and implications of trends in technological change, globalization, labour markets, work organization, managerial practices and employment relations to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions. The sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures, experiences, and other outcomes. It is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies. A classic 1966 study in this field by James Coleman, known as the Coleman Report , analysed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources i.e. per pupil spending . The controversy over school effects ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for desegregation busing in American public schools. Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global e.g. world systems to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster. Human ecology deals with interdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, and to some extent visual sociology. In turn, visual sociologywhich is concerned with all visual dimensions of social lifeoverlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media. Social pre wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi fetal environment. Specifically, social pre wiring refers to the ontogeny of social interaction. Also informally referred to as, wired to be social. The theory questions whether there is a propensity to socially oriented action already present before birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique genetic wiring to be social. Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics. Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co twins were not accidental but specifically aimed. The social pre wiring hypothesis was proved correct, The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' are already performed in the second trimester of gestation. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self directed actions. . Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub fields of sociology. A family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties Relations of blood marriage civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. The notion of childhood is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. Feminist sociology, on the other hand, is a normative sub field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the patriarchy and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. Feminist sociology also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods is also a concern. Social psychology of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood. The sociology of health and illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This sub field also overlaps with gerontology and the study of the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report 1944 . The sociology of the body and embodiment takes a broad perspective on the idea of the body and includes a wide range of embodied dynamics including human and non human bodies, morphology, human reproduction, anatomy, body fluids, biotechnology, genetics. This often intersects with health and illness, but also theories of bodies as political, social, cultural, economic and ideological productions. The ISA maintains a Research Committee devoted to The Body in the Social Sciences . A subfield of the sociology of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology is the study of death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as the sociology of death. This topic is exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl. The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality 1966 and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society compare socially constructed reality . The archaeological and genealogical studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence. The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity. Important theorists in the sociology of science include Robert K. Merton and Bruno Latour. These branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of science and technology studies. Both the ASA and the BSA have sections devoted to the subfield of Science, Knowledge and Technology. The ISA maintains a Research Committee on Science and Technology Sociology of leisure is the study of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the workleisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the workleisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. This area of sociology began with Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class. This subfield of sociology studies, broadly, the dynamics of war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an organization. It is a highly specialized sub field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military. Historically, political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society. A typical research question in this area might be Why do so few American citizens choose to vote In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical survey research by Paul Lazarsfeld. A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and Moisey Ostrogorsky. Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another the politics of who knows how and with what authority and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power. Political sociology has also moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed the role of non governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation state throughout the Earth as a social construct, and the role of stateless entities in the modern world society. Contemporary political sociologists also study inter state interactions and human rights. Demographers or sociologists of population study the size, composition and change over time of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study of population is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and is closely related to human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology. Public sociology refers to an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology is also part of the broader field of science communication or science journalism. The sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth claims, instead assuming what Peter L. Berger has described as a position of methodological atheism . It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates among Roman Catholic and Protestant populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of economic sociology and social stratification The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism 1905 , The Religion of China Confucianism and Taoism 1915 , The Religion of India The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism 1915 , and Ancient Judaism 1920 . Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as secularization, civil religion, the intersection of religion and economics and the role of religion in a context of globalization and multiculturalism. The sociology of change and development attempts to understand how societies develop and how they can be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends, political or technological trends, or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical comparative methods. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with international development or community development. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, Marx contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while Weber argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, Durkheim argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of sociocultural evolution. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, Immanuel Wallerstein extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as world systems theory. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by post colonialism. In recent years, Raewyn Connell issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the Global North. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the lived experiences of the Global South, specifically, so called, Northern Theory lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism. There are many organizations studying social change, including the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, and the Global Social Change Research Project. A social network is a social structure composed of individuals or organizations called nodes , which are tied connected by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society the approach is open to studying less bounded social systems, from non local communities to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from relational sociology, social network analysis avoids treating individuals persons, organizations, states as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by Omar Lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes. Social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into Sociomapping. Sociological social psychology focuses on micro scale social actions. This area may be described as adhering to sociological miniaturism , examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups. Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, group dynamics, prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behaviour, social change, non verbal behaviour, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with psychological emphasis. In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the experimental method however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies . Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction. Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes e.g. occupational . Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies. Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the means of production in the capitalist system the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power forming the material base of the cultural superstructure . Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials e.g. patriarchy . According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables 1 Property class A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. 2 Prestige status A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and 3 Power political party A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries. Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life 1903 focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization, for instance, in Saskia Sassen's study of the Global city . Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists. Often grouped with urban and rural sociology is that of community sociology or the sociology of community. Taking various communitiesincluding online communitiesas the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies distinguished between two types of human association Gemeinschaft usually translated as community and Gesellschaft society or association . In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tonnies argued that Gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a unity of will . The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital. Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular anthropology, political science, economics, social work and social philosophy. Many comparatively new fields such as communication studies, cultural studies, demography and literary theory, draw upon methods that originated in sociology. The terms social science and social research have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology. The distinct field of social anthropology or anthroposociology is the dominant constituent of anthropology throughout the United Kingdom and Commonwealth and much of Europe France in particular , where it is distinguished from cultural anthropology. In the United States, social anthropology is commonly subsumed within cultural anthropology or under the relatively new designation of sociocultural anthropology . Sociology and applied sociology are connected to the professional and academic discipline of social work. Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere on the individual. However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems. For example, a sociologist might study why a community is plagued with poverty. The applied sociologist would be more focused on practical strategies on what needs to be done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on action implementing theses strategies directly or indirectly by means of mental health therapy, counselling, advocacy, community organization or community mobilization. Social anthropology is the branch of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non industrial and non Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge. Sociocultural anthropology, which include linguistic anthropology, is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the nation state to theorizations about culture and power. New challenges have emerged as public debates about multiculturalism, and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology. These times are not business as usual in the academy, in anthropology, or in the world, if ever there were such times. Irving Louis Horowitz, in his The Decomposition of Sociology 1994 , has argued that the discipline, while arriving from a distinguished lineage and tradition , is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs. Furthermore A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivismto an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing this drains sociology of much needed potential. Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. Randall Collins, the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the Social Evolution History journal, has voiced similar sentiments we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other. In 2007, The Times Higher Education Guide published a list of 'The most cited authors of books in the Humanities' including philosophy and psychology . Seven of the top ten are listed as sociologists Michel Foucault 1 , Pierre Bourdieu 2 , Anthony Giddens 5 , Erving Goffman 6 , Jurgen Habermas 7 , Max Weber 8 , and Bruno Latour 10 . The most highly ranked general journals which publish original research in the field of sociology are the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review. The Annual Review of Sociology, which publishes original review essays, is also highly ranked. Many other generalist and specialized journals exist.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology
"Sociology of leisure or leisure sociology is the study of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. Studies of leisure have determined that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's situation presence or lack of family, age, and other factors . Sociology of leisure is a fairly recent subfield of sociology, compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education it saw most of its development in the second half of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies. As John Wilson and others have noted, it is difficult to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non work activity the third further excludes family and household obligations and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings. There are some unresolved questions concerning the definition of work in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering various individuals may or may not classify such activities as leisure . The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies and vice versa , and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for colleagues to be off time friends and to share similar, work based leisure activities. Apart from a definition of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time budget studies have noted that a given amount of time for example, an hour may have different values, depending on when it occurswithin a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, the study of the sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom ongoing since 1971 . In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research interviews . Over time, emphasis in studies of leisure has shifted from the work leisure relation, particularly in well researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted that there are two approaches in the study of leisure formal and historical theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure such as the sociology of sport . The historical theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and social change, often from structural functionalist and neo Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism the American approaches concentrate on the social psychological tradition. Many sociologists have assumed that a given type of leisure activity is most easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. This has yielded fewer results than expected income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable. Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and country club activities such as golf or sailing are significantly correlatedbut so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost . Education is correlated with having a wide range of leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them. As Kelly noted, Predicting a person's leisure behavior on the basis of his socioeconomic position is all but impossible. On the other hand, type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situationwhether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age. Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound. The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle. Specific findings in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late 1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours of leisure time each weekday, and more on weekendssix hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During the second half of the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction. a There were few sociological studies of leisure before the second half of the 20th century. One of the earliest and most celebrated was Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class 1899 .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology%20of%20leisure
"Socompa is a large stratovolcano at the border of Argentina and Chile. Part of the Chilean and Argentine Andean Volcanic Belt AVB , it is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the various segments of the AVB. This part of the Andean volcanic arc begins in Peru and runs first through Bolivia and Chile, and then through Argentina and Chile, and contains about 44 active volcanoes. Socompa lies close to the pass of the same name, where the Salta Antofagasta railway crosses the border. Socompa is known for its large debris avalanche, which was formed 7,200 years ago when most of the northwestern slope collapsed and slid down, forming an extensive deposit. It was at first considered to be either a moraine or a nuee ardende deposit, until the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens prompted awareness of the instability of volcanic edifices and the existence of large scale collapses on them. The Socompa collapse is among the largest known with a volume of 19.2 cubic kilometres 4.6 cu mi and covers a surface area of 490 square kilometres 190 sq mi , and its features are well preserved by the arid climate. Notable are the large toreva blocks which were left behind within the collapse crater. After the landslide, the volcano was rebuilt by the effusion of lava flows and much of the scar is now filled in. Socompa is also noteworthy for the high altitude biotic communities that are bound to fumaroles on the mountain and form well above the regular vegetation in the region. The climate on the mountain is cold and dry. Socompa is situated on the border between Argentina and Chile, due east of Monturaqui. The SaltaAntofagasta railway crosses the border between the two countries just below Socompa, rendering the volcano easily accessible despite its remote location. The same pass was an important route between the two countries and reportedly between 1940 and 1970 the Carabineros de Chile had a post there. Rails and roads at Socompa go up to an elevation of 3,860 metres 12,660 ft from there the volcano can be climbed from its southern, eastern and northern flank. The summit, like many other mountains in the region, features a mountain sanctuary. The volcano is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of the four volcanic zones of the Andean Volcanic Belt. The Central Volcanic Zone spans Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and contains about 44 active volcanoes, plus a number of monogenetic volcanoes and silicic caldera volcanoes. A number of older inactive volcanoes are well preserved owing to the dry climate of the region. Many of these systems are in remote regions and thus are poorly studied but pose little threat to humans. The largest historical eruption in the Central Volcanic Zone occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina in Peru, and the recently most active volcano is Lascar in Chile. Socompa is a 6,051 metre 19,852 ft high composite volcano consisting of a central cone and several lava domes it is the most voluminous conical volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone. Several dacitic lava flows form the summit area of the volcano, the youngest of which originates in a summit dome. This summit dome is capped off by a summit crater at an altitude of 5,850 metres 19,190 ft , and four additional craters occur northeast of the summit at altitudes of 5,600 to 5,800 metres 18,40019,000 ft . Northwest of the summit, a dacitic lava dome is the source of a 500 metre 1,600 ft high talus slope. The summit area is surrounded by an inwards dropping scarp that opens to the northwest and whose southern margin is buried by lava flows. Pyroclastic flows crop out beneath lava flows in the northwestern segment of the volcano, within the scarp. On the southern and eastern side the scarp is 5 kilometres 3.1 mi long and 200400 metres 6601,310 ft high, while the southern side is about 9 kilometres 5.6 mi long. A large wedge shaped scar is recognizable on the northwestern flank, delimited by prominent scarps running through the western and northern flanks of the edifice. The existence of a lake in the summit area within the scarps at elevations of 5,300 metres 17,400 ft has been reported. On the northeastern flank a pumice deposit is clearly visible. Lava domes are recognizable in the southern and western slopes, while lava flows appear mainly on the eastern and northern slopes. The whole edifice has a diameter of 16 kilometres 9.9 mi and, like many Central Andes volcanoes, probably originally consisted of lava domes, lava flows and various pyroclastic formations. The volcano apparently developed within a northwest striking valley, the southern part of which now contains Laguna Socompa. This lake lies at an elevation of 3,400 metres 11,200 ft to the north the volcano is bordered by the 3,200 metre 10,500 ft high Monturaqui basin. A water table exists at depths of 100200 metres 330660 ft , but surface runoff is only ephemeral. Socompa suffered a major sector collapse during the Holocene, forming one of the largest terrestrial collapse deposits. The deposit left by the collapse was first discovered on aerial photography in 1978 but the correct interpretation as a landslide occurred in 1985 at first it was interpreted as a form of moraine, then as a large pyroclastic flow and the collapse scar as a caldera. The collapse removed about 70 about 12 kilometres 7.5 mi of Socompa's circumference on its northwestern side, descended over a vertical distance of about 3,000 metres 9,800 ft and redeposited it over distances of over 40 kilometres 25 mi , at a modelled speed of c. 100 metres per second 220 mph . As it descended, the collapse landslide accumulated sufficient energy that it was able to override topographic obstacles and climb an elevation of about 250 metres 820 ft secondary landslides occurred on the principal deposit and there is evidence that the landslide was reflected back from its margins. The collapse occurred in several steps, with the first parts to fail ending up at the largest distances from the volcano it is not established whether the collapse happened in a single event or as several separate failures. The total volume of material removed was about 19.2 cubic kilometres 4.6 cu mi , which was dilated as it flowed and eventually ended up as a deposit with a volume of 25.7 cubic kilometres 6.2 cu mi thorough mixing of the avalanche material occurred as the landslide progressed. The summit of the volcano was cut by the collapse and some lava domes embedded within the volcano were exposed in the rim of the collapse amphitheatre before the collapse the volcano was about 6,300 metres 20,700 ft high. The collapse scar was partly filled by blocks left over by the collapse. The walls of the amphitheatre were about 2,000 metres 6,600 ft high, so high that secondary landslides occurred. The largest of these detached from a dome northwest of the summit and descended a horizontal distance of 6 kilometres 3.7 mi , forming a landslide structure notable in its own right and covering about 12 square kilometres 4.6 sq mi . The central section of the collapse amphitheatre was not a simple collapse structure, but instead contained a secondary scarp. At the mouth of the collapse scar, the walls were lower, about 300 metres 980 ft . After the principal collapse, lava flows and pyroclastic flows some of which emerge from the western rim of the collapse scar filled up the scar left by the collapse. A similar collapse was observed in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. In fact, the occurrence of a large landslide at Mount St. Helens probably aided in the subsequent identification of the Socompa deposit as a landslide remnant. Other volcanoes have suffered from large scale collapses as well this includes Aucanquilcha, Lastarria and Llullaillaco. In the case of Socompa, the occurrence of the collapse was probably influenced by a northwest tilt of the basement the volcano was constructed on it caused the volcano to slide downward in its northwestern sector and made it prone to a collapse in that direction. The collapse happened about 7,000 years ago, with a date of 7,200 years before present indicated by radiocarbon dating on the deposit it was not witnessed in historical records. This age and the age of similar collapses on Parinacota volcano also in Chile and Mount Meru in Africa coincide with the 8.2 kiloyear event volcanic sector collapses often occur just after glacial maxima, suggesting climatic influence on the occurrence of mass failures of volcanoes. This event probably lasted only 12 minutes based on simulations. There is evidence in the collapse deposit that a lava flow was being erupted on the volcano when the landslide occurred, which together with the presence of pyroclastic fallout on the southwestern side of Socompa implies the collapse may have been started by volcanic activity. The quantity of water in the edifice rocks on the other hand was probably minor. Another theory assumes that the volcanic edifice was destabilized by ductile and mechanically weak layers beneath Socompa under the weight of the volcano these layers can deform and flow outward from the edifice, causing the formation of thrusts at its foot. Evidence of such spreading of the basement under Socompa has been found. The collapse generated a large amount of energy, about 380 petajoules 1.11011 kWh . Some evidence in the form of tephra suggests that the collapse was accompanied by a lateral blast, but other research found no such evidence. Such sector collapse events are catastrophic phenomena, and the debris avalanches associated with them can reach large distances from the original volcano. The fragmentation of rocks during the landslide and the fine material generated during this process might enhance the fluidity of the avalanche, allowing it to extend far away from the source. The collapse deposit covers a surface area of 490 square kilometres 190 sq mi , and is thus not as large as the deposit left by the Mount Shasta collapse or by the Nevado de Colima collapse. It forms the Negros de Aras surface northwest of the volcano and the El Cenizal surface due north where it has a hook like surface distribution the name Negros de Aras was given to the deposit before it was known that it had been formed by a landslide. The thickness of the deposit varies, with thin segments in the extreme southeastern and southwestern parts being less than 10 metres 33 ft thick and the central parts reaching 90 metres 300 ft . The deposit spreads to a maximum width of 20 kilometres 12 mi and is bounded by levees higher than 40 metres 130 ft , which are less prominent on the eastern side. As later parts of the collapse overrode the earlier segments, they formed a northeast trending scarp in the deposit, across which there is a striking difference in the surface morphology of the collapse. The landslide deposit has been stratigraphically subdivided into two units, the Monturaqui unit and the El Cenizal unit. The first unit forms most of the surface and consists itself of several subunits, one of which includes basement rocks that were integrated into the collapse as it occurred. Likewise, the El Cenizal unit included basement rocks as well, such as playa deposits. The amount of basement material is noticeably large and might form as much as 80 of the landslide volume the topography of the northwestern side of the volcano may have prevented the mass failure from being localized along the basement edifice surface area, explaining the large volume of basement involved. Further, the basement derived material was probably mechanically weak and thus allowed the landslide to move over shallow slopes. This basement material forms part of the white surfaces in the landslide deposit other bright areas are formed by fumarolically altered material. The basement material was originally considered to be pumice. The landslide deposit contains large blocks, so called toreva blocks, which were torn from the mountain and came to a standstill unmodified, forming ridges up to several 100 metres 330 ft high the largest such blocks are 2.5 kilometres 1.6 mi long and 1 kilometre 0.62 mi wide and their total volume is about 11 cubic kilometres 2.6 cu mi . These blocks form an almost closed semicircle at the mouth of the collapse amphitheatre and in part retain the previous stratigraphy of the volcano. Such toreva blocks are far more frequent in submarine landslides than subaerial ones and their occurrence at Socompa may reflect the relatively non explosive nature of the collapse and material properties of the collapsed mass. Aside from the toreva blocks, individual blocks with sizes of up to 25 metres 82 ft occur in the deposit and form large boulder fields. In addition to the blocks, the surface of the landslide deposit contains hummock like hills and small topographic depressions. Part of the landslide deposit was later covered by pyroclastic flows, and this covered area is known as the Campo Amarillo. As it descended, the landslide deposit filled a shallow valley that previously existed northwest of the volcano, as well as a larger northeast striking depression. A lava flow was rafted on the avalanche to the El Cenizal area and ended up there almost unmodified. The collapse deposit is well preserved by the arid climate, among the best preserved such deposits in the world. However, because of its sheer size its structure and stratigraphy were only appreciated with the help of remote sensing. Pleistocene lava flows and a northwest striking drainage were buried by the landslide but can still be discerned from aerial imagery apart from these and some hills most of the area covered by the landslide was relatively flat. At La Flexura, part of the basement beneath the avalanche crops out from the ground. Volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate in the Peru Chile Trench at a rate of 79 centimetres per year 2.83.5 in year . It does not cause volcanism among the entire length of the trench where the slab is subducting beneath the South America Plate at a shallow angle there is no recent volcanic activity. The style of subduction has changed over time. About 27 million years ago, the Farallon Plate which hitherto had been subducting beneath South America broke up and the pace of subduction increased, causing increased volcanism. Around the same time, after the Eocene, the subduction angle increased beneath the Altiplano and caused the development of this plateau either from magmatic underplating and or from crustal shortening eventually the crust there became much thicker. Socompa forms a northeast trending alignment with neighbouring volcanoes such as Pular and Pajonales, which reach elevations of about 6,000 metres 20,000 ft . Monogenetic volcanoes were active in the area as well during the Pliocene and Quaternary and generated lava flows. One of these centres is El Negrillar just north of the collapse deposit, which was active during the Pleistocene and formed andesite basaltic andesite lavas unlike the eruption products of Socompa itself. A 200 kilometre 120 mi long lineament known as the Socompa Lineament is associated with the volcano. Other volcanoes such as Cordon de Puntas Negras and the rim of the large La Pacana caldera farther north are also influenced by this lineament. To the west Socompa is bordered by the Sierra de Alameida or Almeida , which farther north merges into the Cordon de Lila. To the east the 6,000 metre 20,000 ft high Salin volcano neighbours Socompa other volcanoes in the area are the 5,340 metre 17,520 ft high Cerro Bayo and the 5,200 metre 17,100 ft high Socompa Cairis, all of which show evidence of glacial activity unlike the younger Socompa. The basement at Socompa is formed by Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations and by Quaternary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The former crop out in the Sierra de Alameida and Alto del Inca west of Socompa and the latter as the 250 metre 820 ft thick Quebrada Salin Beds east of the volcano. Part of these beds were taken up into the avalanche as it collapsed and form the Flexura inliner, others appear in the Loma del Inca area north and the Monturaqui area due west of Socompa. The basement rocks are subdivided into three named formations, the Purilactus Formation of Paleozoic Mesozoic age, the San Pedro and Tambores formations of Oligocene Miocene age and the Miocene Pliocene Salin formation part of the latter formation may have been erupted by Socompa itself. The volcano is situated at the point where the Sierra de Alameida meets the Puna block. During the Pliocene this basement was covered by the Arenosa and Tucucaro ignimbrites 2.5 and 3.2 million years ago by potassium argon dating, respectively which also crop out west of Socompa Socompa is probably constructed on top of these ignimbrites. The Arenosa ignimbrite is about 30 metres 98 ft thick while the Tucucaro reaches a thickness of 5 metres 16 ft . Some normal faults appear in the area north of Socompa and appear to run through the edifice. While they are not visible in the edifice itself, Socompa was uplifted on its southeastern side by the fault motion. This might have aided in the onset of edifice instability and the collapse event. In addition, directly north northwest of Socompa lie three anticlines probably formed under the influence of the mass of both Socompa and Pajonales The Loma del Inca, Loma Alta and La Flexura. Socompa has erupted andesite and dacite, with dacite dominating. Phenocrysts found in the rocks of the avalanche include the minerals augite, hornblende, hypersthene, magnetite and plagioclase dacites also contain biotite while andesites also contain olivine. In the summit area, clay, silt and sulfur bearing rocks are also found. There are few data on climate at Socompa. The area is windy and dry given that the volcano lies in the Desert Puna, with frequent snow cover but no glaciers. The relatively low cloud cover means that insolation is high. Weather data collected in 1991 found an average temperature of 5.5 C 22.1 F , a large diurnal air temperature cycle and a larger soil temperature cycle of c.60 10 C 14014 F and low evaporation. The present day precipitation has been estimated to be 400 millimetres per year 16 in year , with other estimates assuming less than 200 millimetres per year 7.9 in year . Periglacial landforms indicate that in the past the area was wetter, possibly thanks to the Little Ice Age. There is however no evidence for Pleistocene glaciation including no cirques, which may be due to the volcano's young age. Socompa features autotrophic communities associated with fumaroles and thermal anomalies at high altitude, between 5,7506,050 metres 18,86019,850 ft of elevation. The autotrophic communities on Socompa are the highest known in the world, and they occur both on the actual fumaroles and on cold fumaroles . The various species are often extremophiles since the environment on Socompa is harsh, and the communities also include heterotrophic species. Such heterotrophs include ascomycota and basidiomycota, the latter of which have noticeable similarity to Antarctic basidiomycota. The fumaroles on Socompa also feature stands of bryophytes such as liverworts and mosses as well as lichens and algae, and animals have been found in the stands. These stands are among the highest in the world and cover noticeably large surface areas despite their elevation, and are fairly remote from other plant life in the region. There is a noticeable diversity between separate stands, and the vegetation is quite dissimilar to the vegetation in the surroundings but resembles that found in the paramo and cloud forests in South America and the subantarctic islands. A sparse vegetation cover is also found on the lower slopes of Socompa. Activity at Socompa commenced with the extrusion of andesites, which were followed later by dacites. Several Plinian eruptions have occurred on Socompa. Several dates have been obtained on Socompa rocks, including 2,000,000 1,000,000, 1,300,000 500,000, 800,000 300,000 and less than 500,000 years ago. After the sector collapse 7,200 years ago, activity continued filling the collapse scar. The explosion craters on the summit are the youngest volcanic landforms on Socompa, there are no dates available for the lava domes and flows within the collapse scar. The youngest eruption was dated to have occurred 5,250 years before present. The absence of moraines on Socompa suggests that volcanic activity occurred during the post glacial time. The volcano also has a young appearance, similar to historically active Andean volcanoes such as San Pedro, implying recent volcanic activity. There is no evidence for historical activity at Socompa and the volcano is not considered an active volcano, but both fumarolic activity and the emission of CO2 have been observed. The fumarolic activity is relatively weak anecdotal reports indicate a smell of sulfur on the summit. Groundwater is warmer and richer in CO2 the closer to Socompa it is pumped, also suggesting that volcanic gas fluxes still occur at the volcano and that the volcano influences groundwater systems. Hot springs are found at Laguna Socompa as well. In 2011, the Chilean mining company Escondida Mining was considering building a geothermal power plant on Socompa to supply energy the Argentine Servicio Geologico Minero agency started exploration work in January 2018 for geothermal power production.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socompa
"The Socorro springsnail, scientific name Pyrgulopsis neomexicana, is an endangered species of minute freshwater snail with a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk or micromollusk in the family Hydrobiidae, the mud snails. This tiny snail previously inhabited a small group of thermal springs in the State of New Mexico, USA. Its survival is seriously endangered because its habitat is both vulnerable and severely threatened. The current status of the population of this snail and its habitat area is unknown. The Socorro springsnail has been listed as endangered by the governments of the United States and New Mexico. Very little is known about this snail in general, because of its minute size, its very restricted range, and the fact that the places where it currently lives are on private property which allows no access. The Socorro springsnail was originally described from warm springs in Socorro, New Mexico. The collector and date of the unique first sample are unknown. Specimens came from the collection of American mineralogist Charles Moore Wheatley 1822 Essex, England 1882, Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. and were likely collected in the 19th century. The species was formally described and named Amnicola neomexicana by American malacologist mollusk expert Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1916. Pilsbry's original type description, the text where the species is officially named and described, reads as follows Socorro, New Mexico, in warm springs. Types no. 121,113 in the Wheatley collection, deposited in Mus. A. N. S. P. This species, known by many specimens, is smaller than Amnicola micrococcus, with a narrow aperture, straight inner lip and less impressed suture. Nearly all of the shells are eroded, the spire being deeply corroded in fully adult individuals. This gives an abrupt outline of the suture, in front view. In 1982, American zoologist John B. Burch reclassified the Socorro springsnail as Fontelicella neomexicana. In 1987, two other American zoologists, Robert Hershler from the National Museum of Natural History and Fred Gilbert Thompson from the Florida State Museum now the Florida Museum of Natural History assigned members of the genus Fontelicella, including F. neomexicana, to the genus Pyrgulopsis. The Socorro springsnail has an elongate ovate conical shell that is light tan and short spired, in other words the shell is low and rounded, without much of a pointed tip to it. The shell has 3.54.5 whorls. The protoconch is usually eroded. The internal callus is reddish brown to amber, and the operculum is pale. The height of the shell is 1.62.3 mm, and its aperture is ovate. The body, head, snout and tentacles are dark gray to black in color. The tentacles range from black or dark gray at the base, to pale gray at the tips. Female snails are larger than males. In the male, the penis has a long glandular strip on the terminal lobe, a long penial gland, and three shorter dorsal glandular strips. A detailed description of the reproductive system of this snail species was provided by Hershler in 1994. The animal respires by using a type of gill known as a ctenidium a comb like respiratory apparatus which in this species has 20 tall and narrow ctenidial filaments. In all of the species in the genus Pyrgulopsis, the radula a strong rasping feeding ribbon covered in microscopic teeth is of taenioglossan type seven teeth in each row, i.e. one middle, two laterals and 4 marginals. The radula of Pyrgulopsis neomexicana was described in detail by Hershler 1994 . This species is endemic to Socorro County in central New Mexico in the southwestern United States. The original specimen of the Socorro springsnail reportedly came from a thermal spring near Socorro, New Mexico. It is now extinct at the type locality, but the date and cause of the extinction are uncertain. The species has been reported from other springs in Socorro County Landye 1981 , although there is disagreement on whether the species historically occurred there. Currently, the Socorro springsnail is known from only one spring the Torreon Spring in Socorro County, New Mexico, where it was located in 1979. The Socorro springsnail is entirely aquatic, occurring in low velocity slow moving water near spring sources in a thermal habitat, i.e. near hot springs. More precisely, it is found in the uppermost layer of an organic muck substrate or surface. The principal spring source where the Socorro springsnail is currently found has been impounded artificially enclosed, blocked off or dammed , and this has reduced the flowing water habitat to a very small pool. Only one tiny spring source remains, and this has a small improved pool less than 1 m2 in area , with a water temperature of 17 C. The species is abundant on rootlets in this pool, but is not found in the ditches and ponds radiating from the spring into irrigation structures. Other mollusks found in the vicinity include Physa mexicana, Lymnaea modicella, and Pisidium casertanum. In 1981, the colony of Socorro springsnails was found to occupy not only the source, but also the outflow tributary about 2.5 m 8 ft long to an irrigation ditch. No snails were found in the irrigation flow itself however. In 1991, the total population of the Socorro springsnail in the spring outflow was estimated at 5,000 individuals. The snail had formerly occurred throughout the thermal springs west of the city of Socorro, living in the same habitats as the Socorro isopod Thermosphaeroma thermophilum. This species is herbivorous. It feeds on algae and other materials that occur in the organic film which is found on the surface of plants and debris. The females of the Socorro springsnail are oviparous, in other words, they lay eggs. They probably deposit eggs in spring and summer. The limited range and precise habitat demands of the Socorro springsnail makes this species vulnerable to habitat loss or alteration. Potential threats to the species include all activities that would significantly reduce either spring flow or availability of the food source that supports this springsnail species. Alterations to the watersheds, springs, or associated runs could cause a reduction in water flow, a change in water temperature or water quality, or could modify the habitat or food source. This could have a devastating impact on the existing populations of the snail. This snail species has extremely limited dispersal capabilities, which means it has little or no ability to find, and disperse to, other suitable habitats, or to move out of a habitat where the conditions have changed such that it is no longer suitable. Consequently, these snails are unable to avoid contaminants or other unfavorable changes to their habitat. The population of the Socorro springsnail is thought to be limited to a single pool which is less than 1 m2 in area, and an outflow ditch about 2.5 m 8 ft in length. Several of the springs that formerly contained the Socorro springsnail have been impounded, and this has eliminated the precise habitat that is critical for the species survival. Perhaps the greatest threat facing this species is the potential loss of water flow. Excessive pumping from the aquifer that supplies water to the springs could destroy both the springs themselves and the species along with them. Potential pollution of the spring could negatively impact this species and perhaps could also cause its extinction. The effects of climate change, if they include widespread drought, decreased spring discharge, or a change in water chemistry, are a newly recognized threat that could eliminate the species. The State of New Mexico listed the Socorro springsnail as endangered, group 2, on March 28, 1985 Section 17237 through 17246 NMSA 1978 . On October 30, 1991, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also listed this species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Because of the extremely limited distribution, the recovery strategy for this species has its foundation in the maintenance of their habitat. While it is possible that additional populations might be established in other thermal springs, this possibility is contingent upon finding springs within the species presumed historic range that have the physical and biologic attributes, including terrestrial habitat components, that the springsnail requires to survive, and which do not support their own endemic fauna. The locality is on private land and access to the spring has been denied since 1995. Because of this, the recent population numbers are unknown, the status of the habitat is unknown, and the magnitude of current threats is also unknown. Lack of cooperation by the private land owner and impacts caused by their actions were not specifically identified as a threat. However the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommendations for further actions suggested that efforts should continue in an attempt to gain access to the spring. If and when access is granted, it was recommended that life history studies should be carried out, monitor population numbers should be monitored, the attributes of suitable habitat should be determined qualities like the exact nature of the preferred substrate, the water temperature limits, pH, hardness, alkalinity etc. and that long term monitoring of discharge and temperature should be set up. If on the other hand, access continues to be denied, the recommendation was to attempt to set up a one time visit to the spring in order to collect individuals for a captive refugium population. A decision was made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service not to implement the part of the Endangered Species Act which allows the authorities to acquire land as necessary if it is critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species, because it was felt in this situation that making the land public would actually expose the remaining population to an even greater risk of extinction from threats such as vandalism and collection by unauthorized parties. A habitat management plan had not yet been written for the species as of 2008, as was directed by the 1994 recovery plan, which also covered another species, the Alamosa springsnail. The 1994 recovery plan is out of date and needs to be revised and updated. It was recommended that a separate plan should be created.

"Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro 10 October 1884 3 February 1959 , also known as Phramongkolthepmuni Thai , was the abbot of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen from 1916 until his death in 1959. He founded the Thai Dhammakaya meditation school in the early 20th century. As the former abbot of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, he is often called Luang Pu Wat Paknam, meaning 'the Venerable Father of Wat Paknam'. He became a well known meditation master during the interbellum and the Second World War, and played a significant role in developing Thai Buddhism during that period. He is considered by the Dhammakaya Movement to have rediscovered Vijja Dhammakaya, a meditation method believed to have been used by the Buddha himself. Since the 2000s, some scholars have pointed out that Luang Pu Sodh also played an important role in introducing Theravada Buddhism in the West, a point previously overlooked. Luang Pu Sodh was born as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a relatively well off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102 km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, and he had to take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This affected him thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years. When Sodh was twenty two years old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his hometown and was given the Pali language monastic name Candasaro. Phra phra meaning 'monk, venerable' Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, from the first day following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season third year after monk's ordination , Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, and was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, including Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation. Although Phra Candasaro had studied with many masters, and had mastered many important Pali texts, he was not satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat vassa after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple where he used to receive education as a child. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of meditation. He meditated for three hours on the mantra samma araham, which means righteous Absolute of Attainment which a human being can achieve. Then his mind became still and firmly established at the very centre of his body, and he experienced a bright and shining sphere of Dhamma at the centre of his body, followed by new spheres, each brighter and clearer. According to Luang Pu Sodh, this was the true Dhamma body, or Dhammakaya, the spiritual essence of the Buddha and nibbana exists as a literal reality within the human body, and the true Self as opposed to the non self . According to MacKenzie, Luang Phaw Sot sought to relate his breakthrough to the Satipatthana Sutta. He interpreted a phrase which is normally understood as contemplating the body as a body as contemplating the body in the body. Convinced that he had attained the core of the Buddha's teaching, Phra Candasaro started a new chapter in his life, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition. Phra Candasaro devoted the rest of his life to teaching and furthering the depth of knowledge of Dhammakaya meditation, a meditation method which he also called Vijja Dhammakaya , 'the direct knowledge of the Dhammakaya'. Temples in the tradition of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, together called the Dhammakaya Movement, believe that this method was the method the Buddha originally used to attain Enlightenment, but was lost five hundred years after the Buddha passed away. The event of the attainment of the Dhammakaya is usually described by the Dhammakaya movement in miraculous and cosmic terms. For example, it is mentioned that heavy rains preceded the event. Phra Candasaro spent much time teaching. Even when he was still at Wat Pho, he would teach Pali language in his own kuti monastic living space to other monks and novices. He had also restored an abandoned temple in his hometown Song Phi Nong and set up a school for Dhamma studies for lay people in Wat Phrasriratanamahathat in Suphanburi. He enrolled for the reformed Pali examinations, but did not pass. He did not enroll again, even though he was a more than capable scholar he believed that having obtained an official Pali degree, he might be recruited for administrative work in the Sangha monastic community , which he did not aim for. Nevertheless, because of his work, he was noticed by leading monks in the Sangha. Still in 1916, Somdet Phuean, the monastic governor of Phasi Charoen, appointed Phra Candasaro as caretaker abbot Thai of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, located in Thonburi. From then onward, he was usually referred to as Luang Por Sodh or Luang Pu Sodh . In 1916, Thonburi was not part of Bangkok yet, and had no bridge to connect it to Bangkok. Wat Paknam faced social and disciplinary problems, and required a good leader. Luang Pu Sodh promoted and enforced strict monastic discipline. He was able to change Wat Paknam Bhascharoen, a temple that was neglected and almost vacant, into a temple with hundreds of monks, a school for Buddhist studies, but also a government approved primary school with a mundane curriculum, and a kitchen to make the temple self sufficient. Apart from monastic residents, the kitchen would also provide food for all the lay visitors of the temple. Wat Paknam became a popular center of meditation teaching. Luang Pu Sodh emphasized the development of people more than construction besides developing a large community of monks in the temple in 1959, five hundred monks, the highest in Thailand at the time , he also set up a community of mae chis nuns , with separate kutis and meditation rooms. Mae chis played an important role in Wat Paknam's Dhamma and meditation propagation. In the first period, Luang Pu Sodh's work was not appreciated by some lay people who, according to biographies, had illegal business with the temple and did not appreciate Luang Pu Sodh changing the temple. Once he was even shot at, though not hurt. Soon after his appointment as temporary abbot, he was appointed fully as abbot of Wat Paknam, where he remained until his death in 1959. For his life and work he was given monastic and royal honorific names, that is Phrakhru Samanadham samathan in 1921 , Phrabhavanakosolthera in 1949 , Phramongkolratmuni in 1955 , and finally Phramongkolthepmuni in 1957 . The last three royal titles were given late, due to the fact that the temple was not under royal patronage, and therefore received less attention from the royal family than other temples. During a ministry of over half a century, Luang Pu Sodh taught Dhammakaya meditation continuously, guiding meditation every Thursday and preaching on Buddhism on Sundays and Uposatha days. Luang Pu Sodh would distribute an introductory book about meditation to practitioners. At first, the Dhammakaya meditation method drew criticism from the Thai Sangha authorities, because it was a new method. Discussion within the Sangha led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but it was concluded that Luang Pu Sodh's method was correct. In teaching meditation, Luang Pu Sodh would challenge others to meditate so that they might verify for themselves the benefits of Dhammakaya meditation. He organized a team of his most gifted meditation practitioners and set up a 'meditation factory of direct knowledge' Thai . These practitioners, mostly monks and mae chis, would meditate in an isolated location at the temple, in shifts for twenty four hours a day, one shift lasting for six hours. Their brief was to devote their lives to meditation research for the common good of society. In the literature of the Dhammakaya movement many accounts are found about Dhammakaya meditation solving problems in society and the world at large. Dhammakaya meditation wasand still isbelieved to bring forth certain psychic powers Pali abhinna , such as travelling to other spheres of existence, and reading people's minds. Publications describe that Dhammakaya meditation was used during the Second World War to prevent Thailand from being bombed. Luang Pu Sodh also used meditation in healing people, for which he became widely known. An often quoted anecdote is the story of Somdet Puean, the abbot of Wat Pho, who, after meditating with Luang Pu Sodh, recovered from his illness. An important student in the meditation factory was Maechi Chandra Khonnokyoong, who Luang Pu Sodh once described as first among many, second to none in terms of meditation skill, according to the biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh promoted the study of Buddhism as well. In this combination he was one of the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more time to study the Dhamma. Luang Pu Sodh took part in the construction of the Phutthamonthon, an ambitious project of Prime Minister Phibun Songkhram in the 1950s. The park was built to host the 2500 Buddha Jayanti celebrations. Judging from the chapel at the centre of the Phutthamonthon, dedicated to Luang Pu Sodh and Dhammakaya meditation, as well as the amulets Luang Pu Sodh issued to raise funds for the park, Newell speculates Luang Pu Sodh assumed a significant role in building the park and had an important relation with PM Phibun. According to the biography by Wat Phra Dhammakaya, Luang Pu Sodh did not endorse magical practices that are common in Thai Buddhism, such as fortune telling and spells for good luck. He did, however, often heal people through meditation, and Luang Pu Sodh's amulets wereand are stillwidely venerated for their attributed powers. Luang Pu Sodh had a great interest to introduce Dhammakaya meditation outside of Thailand. Wat Paknam already published international magazines and leaflets in the time Kapilavaddho, his first Western student, started living under the guidance of Luang Pu Sodh. The periodical of the temple was in both Thai and English, and at certain occasions booklets would be published in Chinese as well. In old periodicals of the temple visits from high standing monks from Japan and China have been recorded, and Dhammakaya meditation is still passed on by Japanese Shingon Buddhists that used to practice at Wat Paknam. Luang Pu Sodh was one of the first Thai preceptors to ordain people outside Thailand as Buddhist monks. He ordained the Englishman William Purfurst a.k.a. Richard Randall with the monastic name Kapilavaddho Bhikkhu at Wat Paknam in 1954. Kapilavaddho returned to Britain to found the English Sangha Trust two years later. Former director of the trust Terry Shine described Kapilavaddho as the man who started and developed the founding of the first English Theravada Sangha in the Western world . He was the first Englishman to be ordained in Thailand, but disrobed in 1957, shortly after his mentor Phra Thitavedo had a disagreement with Luang Pu Sodh and left Wat Paknam. He was ordained again in England, and became the director of the English Sangha Trust in 1967. Luang Pu Sodh ordained another British monk, Peter Morgan, with the name Pannavaddho Bhikkhu. After his death he would continue under the guidance of Ajahn Maha Bua. Phra Pannavaddho remained in the monkhood until his death in 2004, when he had ordained for the longest of all westerners in Thailand. A third monk, formerly known as George Blake, was a Brit of Jamaican origin, and was the first Jamaican to be ordained as a Buddhist monk. He was ordained as Vijjavaddho, and later disrobed, becoming a well known therapist in Canada. The ordination of Vijjavaddho, Pannavaddho and another British monk called Saddhavaddho Robert Albison was a major public event in Thailand, attracting an audience of ten thousand people. Namgyal Rinpoche Leslie George Dawson , a teacher in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, also studied for a while under Luang Por Sodh, but he was not ordained under him. One of the last Western students in the time of Luang Pu Sodh was Terrence Magness, who learnt Dhammakaya meditation at Wat Paknam as well, from the lay teacher Acharn Kalayawadee. He was ordained under the name Suratano, and wrote a biography about Luang Pu Sodh. In summary, Luang Pu Sodh had a significant impact on Thai Buddhism, both in Thailand and abroad. He helped pioneer the combination of study and meditation, traditionally two separate monastic vocations. Newell points out that in this he even preceded Phra Phimontham, the administrator monk who introduced the New Burmese meditation Method in Thailand. Luang Pu Sodh ordained a British monk that helped pioneer Buddhism in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, he started many developments that were continued by Wat Phra Dhammakaya, later to become the largest temple of Thailand. In 1954, Luang Pu Sodh made an announcement that he would die soon, and instructed his students to continue their duties without him, especially to propagate Dhammakaya meditation. Two years later, he was diagnosed with hypertension. Luang Pu Sodh died in 1959. His body was not cremated, but embalmed, so that after his death people would still come and support Wat Paknam. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya a memorial hall was built in honor of Luang Pu Sodh, and in Wat Paknam, a charity foundation was started in his name.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luang%20Pu%20Sodh%20Candasaro
"Sodium is a chemical element with the symbol Na from Latin natrium and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell, which it readily donates, creating a positively charged ionthe Na cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite, and rock salt NaCl . Many salts of sodium are highly water soluble sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans. Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide lye is used in soap manufacture, and sodium chloride edible salt is a de icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans. Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid ECF and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia. By means of the sodium potassium pump, living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40 1, and sodium, about 1 10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulsean action potentialwhen the charge is dissipated sodium plays a key role in that activity. Sodium at standard temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in the air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, which are the conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting 98 C and boiling 883 C points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides. In a flame test, sodium and its compounds glow yellow because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a photon when they fall from 3p to 3s the wavelength of this photon corresponds to the D line at about 589.3 nm. Spin orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two, at 589.0 and 589.6 nm hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines. Twenty isotopes of sodium are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is created in the carbon burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star of at least three solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation 22Na has a half life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half life of 15 hours all other isotopes have a half life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer lived one being 24mNa with a half life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na. Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, one more than the extremely stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ mol, the sodium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high 4562 kJ mol , because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na cation. The most common oxidation state for sodium is 1. It is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium. Sodium metal is highly reducing, with the standard reduction potential for the Na Na couple being 2.71 volts, though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials. Sodium compounds are of immense commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt NaCl , soda ash Na2CO3 , baking soda NaHCO3 , caustic soda NaOH , sodium nitrate NaNO3 , di and tri sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate Na2S2O35H2O , and borax Na2B4O710H2O . In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions and is viewed as a hard Lewis acid. Most soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Sodium soaps have a higher melting temperature and seem harder than potassium soaps. Like all the alkali metals, sodium reacts exothermically with water, and sufficiently large pieces melt to a sphere and may explode. The reaction produces caustic soda sodium hydroxide and flammable hydrogen gas. When burned in air, it forms primarily sodium peroxide with some sodium oxide. Sodium tends to form water soluble compounds, such as halides, sulfates, nitrates, carboxylates and carbonates. The main aqueous species are the aquo complexes Na H2O n , where n 48 with n 6 indicated from X ray diffraction data and computer simulations. Direct precipitation of sodium salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically have a high affinity for water an exception is sodium bismuthate NaBiO3 . Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol for example, only 0.35 g L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15 crown 5, may be used as a phase transfer catalyst. Sodium content in bulk may be determined by treating with a large excess of uranyl zinc acetate the hexahydrate UO2 3ZnNa CH3CO2 96H2O precipitates and can be weighed. Caesium and rubidium do not interfere with this reaction, but potassium and lithium do. Lower concentrations of sodium may be determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion selective electrodes. Like the other alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the coordination complex Na NH3 6 , with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions cryptands permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands. For example, 15 crown 5 has a high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of 15 crown 5 is 1.72.2 A, which is enough to fit the sodium ion 1.9 A . Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, also have a high affinity for the sodium ion derivatives of the alkalide Na are obtainable by the addition of cryptands to solutions of sodium in ammonia via disproportionation. Many organosodium compounds have been prepared. Because of the high polarity of the C Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions salts with organic anions . Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide NaC5H5 and trityl sodium C6H5 3CNa . Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na , a strong reducing agent. Sodium forms alloys with many metals, such as potassium, calcium, lead, and the group 11 and 12 elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 4090 potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium calcium alloys are by products of the electrolytic production of sodium from a binary salt mixture of NaCl CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl CaCl2 BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with sodium. In a liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolytically on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 are some of the known sodium lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold NaAu2 and silver NaAg2 . Group 12 metals zinc, cadmium and mercury are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg. Because of its importance in human metabolism, salt has long been an important commodity, as shown by the English word salary, which derives from salarium, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic suda, meaning headache, as the headache alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times. Although sodium, sometimes called soda, had long been recognized in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. In 1809, the German physicist and chemist Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert proposed the names Natronium for Humphry Davy's sodium and Kalium for Davy's potassium . The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published in 1814 by Jons Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols, and is an abbreviation of the element's New Latin name natrium, which refers to the Egyptian natron, a natural mineral salt mainly consisting of hydrated sodium carbonate. Natron historically had several important industrial and household uses, later eclipsed by other sodium compounds. Sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames. As early as 1860, Kirchhoff and Bunsen noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test, and stated in Annalen der Physik und Chemie In a corner of our 60 m3 room farthest away from the apparatus, we exploded 3 mg of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From the weight of the sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1 20 millionth weight of sodium. The Earth's crust contains 2.27 sodium, making it the seventh most abundant element on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind aluminium, iron, calcium, and magnesium and ahead of potassium. Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08104 milligrams per liter. Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble, such as amphibole and zeolite. The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate. Atomic sodium has a very strong spectral line in the yellow orange part of the spectrum the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights . This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely spaced lines split by a fine and hyperfine structure. The strength of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form rather than ionised . This corresponds to stars of roughly F type and cooler. Many other stars appear to have a sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation. Sodium has also been detected in numerous Solar System environments, including Mercury's atmosphere, the exosphere of the Moon, and numerous other bodies. Some comets have a sodium tail, which was first detected in observations of Comet Hale Bopp in 1997. Sodium has even been detected in the atmospheres of some extrasolar planets via transit spectroscopy. Employed only in rather specialized applications, only about 100,000 tonnes of metallic sodium are produced annually. Metallic sodium was first produced commercially in the late 19th century by carbothermal reduction of sodium carbonate at 1100 C, as the first step of the Deville process for the production of aluminium The high demand for aluminium created the need for the production of sodium. The introduction of the HallHeroult process for the production of aluminium by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium. A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886. Sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, based on a process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700 C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide . The market for sodium is volatile due to the difficulty in its storage and shipping it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide. Though metallic sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds millions of tons of sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti icing and de icing and as a preservative examples of the uses of sodium bicarbonate include baking, as a raising agent, and sodablasting. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions such as the aldol reaction in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry. Metallic sodium is used mainly for the production of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective. Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma vapor lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry. In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohol and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution, it can be used to reduce alkynes to trans alkenes. Lasers emitting light at the sodium D line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land based visible light telescopes. Liquid sodium is used as a heat transfer fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient normal pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium 24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. Another heat transfer application is poppet valves in high performance internal combustion engines the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves. In humans, sodium is an essential mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate MSG , sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda sodium bicarbonate , and sodium benzoate. The U.S. Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3 grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4 grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2 g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mm Hg. It has been estimated that such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17 fewer cases of hypertension. Hypertension causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide each year. Note that salt contains about 39.3 sodium the rest being chlorine and trace chemicals thus, 2.3 g sodium is about 5.9 g, or 5.3 ml, of saltabout one US teaspoon. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 1.5 g of sodium per day. One study found that people with or without hypertension who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine and therefore were taking in less than 3 g d had a higher risk of death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7 g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5 g. The reninangiotensin system regulates the amount of fluid and sodium concentration in the body. Reduction of blood pressure and sodium concentration in the kidney result in the production of renin, which in turn produces aldosterone and angiotensin, which stimulates the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream. When the concentration of sodium increases, the production of renin decreases, and the sodium concentration returns to normal. The sodium ion Na is an important electrolyte in neuron function, and in osmoregulation between cells and the extracellular fluid. This is accomplished in all animals by Na K ATPase, an active transporter pumping ions against the gradient, and sodium potassium channels. Sodium is the most prevalent metallic ion in extracellular fluid. Unusually low or high sodium levels in humans are recognized in medicine as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. These conditions may be caused by genetic factors, ageing, or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. In C4 plants, sodium is a micronutrient that aids metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding in the opening and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. Halophytes have adapted to be able to flourish in sodium rich environments. Sodium forms flammable hydrogen and caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes in the presence of water due to the formation of hydrogen highly explosive and sodium hydroxide which dissolves in the water, liberating more surface . However, sodium exposed to air and ignited or reaching autoignition reported to occur when a molten pool of sodium reaches about 290 C displays a relatively mild fire. In the case of massive non molten pieces of sodium, the reaction with oxygen eventually becomes slow due to formation of a protective layer. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are workable with sodium. An effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is Met L X. Other effective agents include Lith X, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand. Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas. Pool type sodium fires are prevented using different design measures called catch pan systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium
"SODO is a light rail station located in Seattle, Washington. It is situated between the Beacon Hill and Stadium stations on the Red Line, which runs from SeattleTacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington as part of the Link light rail system. The station consists of two at grade side platforms at the intersection of the SODO Busway and South Lander Street in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. SODO station was first proposed in the late 1980s, but was ignored in subsequent light rail proposals until the addition of the Beacon Hill Tunnel to the Central Link route in 1998 now part of the Red Line . It was built between 2005 and 2006 by Kiewit Pacific and opened to Link service on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station twenty hours a day on most days the headway between trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. SODO station is also served by several Sound Transit Express and King County Metro buses that stop on the SODO Busway adjacent to the platforms. SODO station is situated along the SODO Busway in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The entrances to its two side platforms is located at the intersection of the SODO Busway and South Lander Street, adjacent to a United States Postal Service parking garage. The area surrounding the station consists of a mixture of industrial and low density commercial areas without residences, employing over 12,000 workers. Major employers in the area include Starbucks, who has their headquarters at the Starbucks Center five blocks west of the station, and Seattle Public Schools at the John Stanford Center. The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects SODO station to Stadium station at South Royal Brougham Way. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend the trail to Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle a connector trail on Forest Street to a segregated cycletrack on Airport Way is also being considered. The earliest proposal for a light rail station at South Lander Street in SODO came from the Puget Sound Council of Governments in 1986, as part of a northsouth line from Lynnwood to Federal Way, following the Duwamish River from Downtown Seattle to the SeattleTacoma International Airport. The station was omitted from the 1993 Regional Transit Project proposal, and the two Sound Transit proposals in 1995 and 1996, with the latter being approved to follow Interstate 90 toward the Rainier Valley. Sound Transit added several alternative routes to Central Link in 1998, including Route C1 consisting of an at grade segment parallel to the existing SODO Busway and a tunnel under Beacon Hill, with stations at South Royal Brougham Way, South Lander Street and under Beacon Hill. Route C1 was selected as the final route for Central Link now the Red Line in 1999, with a station at South Lander Street being approved ahead of the deferred Royal Brougham and Beacon Hill stations. A groundbreaking ceremony for the Central Link project was held at SODO station in November 2003, with construction beginning after utility poles located next to the SODO Busway were relocated to clear the track's right of way. The Sound Transit Board officially named the station after the SoDo neighborhood on January 13, 2005, replacing the provisional name of South Lander Street. The first rails on Central Link were laid between Holgate and Lander streets in August 2005, with the first piece of station art being installed at SODO station during the same month. The station itself was built by Kiewit Pacific in less than a year, with opening ceremonies for SODO and Stadium stations held on May 30, 2006, celebrating the completion of the first two Central Link stations. Light rail testing on the 1.3 mile long 2.1 km , at grade SoDo segment was carried out by Sound Transit between March 2007 and February 2008, allowing the agency to declare the segment substantially complete in June 2008. SODO station was opened to the public on July 18, 2009, during the first day of Central Link service. SODO station consists of two 400 foot long 120 m at grade side platforms, located 160 feet 49 m north of the station's entrance at South Lander Street. The station includes the largest bicycle facility in the Link light rail system, with 64 covered spaces at a bicycle parking station and 24 bicycle lockers adjacent to the nearby SODO Trail. SODO station also houses a free standing art installation as part of the STart program, which allocates a percentage of project construction funds to art projects to be used in stations. Located at east side of the station entrance, Michael Davis's Made in USA consists of a 24 foot high 7.3 m by 14 foot wide 4.3 m archway that is made of an oversized try square, spirit level, and carpenter pencil, installed in August 2005 to honor the industrial heritage of SoDo. The plaza also includes seating made of sliced steel I beams and a cog, with cast bronze replicas of workbench tools soldered onto the granite tops the seating is meant to humanize the industrial environment, illustrating the process of transforming ideas and raw materials into a completed project. The station's pictogram, an anvil, represents the industrial heritage of the SODO area. It was created by Christian French as part of the Stellar Connections series and its points represent nearby destinations, including the Starbucks Center, the Link railyard, Rainier Brewery, and the Beacon Hill Tunnel. SODO station is part of Sound Transit's Red Line, which runs from SeattleTacoma International Airport through the Rainier Valley and Downtown Seattle to the University of Washington. It is the ninth northbound station from Angle Lake station and eighth southbound station from University of Washington station, and is situated between Beacon Hill and Stadium stations. Red Line trains serve SODO twenty hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5 00 am to 1 00 am, and eighteen hours on Sundays, from 6 00 am to 12 00 am during regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every six to ten minutes during rush hour and midday operation, respectively, with longer headways of fifteen minutes in the early morning and twenty minutes at night. During weekends, Red Line trains arrive at SODO station every ten minutes during midday hours and every fifteen minutes during mornings and evenings. The station is approximately 27 minutes from SeaTac Airport station and eleven minutes from Westlake station in Downtown Seattle. In 2017, an average of 2,180 passengers boarded Link trains at SODO stadium on weekdays. Stadium station is also served by several bus routes on the SODO Busway, which runs parallel to the Red Line, at a pair of bus stops west of the station platforms at South Lander Street. Three Sound Transit Express routes stop at the station on their way to Tacoma, Lakewood, and Gig Harbor. King County Metro operates three all day routes through the SODO Busway that serve West Seattle, the Rainier Valley, Renton, Tukwila, and Kent. Metro also runs four peak direction routes through the SODO Busway towards Renton, Fairwood, Federal Way, and Redondo Heights. In addition to regular bus service, Metro also runs the Route 97 Link Shuttle, a shuttle service serving Link stations along surface streets during Link service disruptions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SODO%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29
"Soedjatmoko born Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat 10 January 1922 21 December 1989 , familiarly called Bung Koko, was an Indonesian intellectual and diplomat. Born to a noble father and mother in Sawahlunto, West Sumatra, after finishing his primary education, he went to Batavia modern day Jakarta to study medicine in the city's slums, he saw much poverty, which became an academic interest later in life. After being expelled from medical school by the Japanese in 1943 for his political activities, Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and practised medicine with his father. In 1947, after Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to Lake Success, New York, to represent Indonesia at the United Nations UN . They helped secure international recognition of the country's sovereignty. After his work at the UN, Soedjatmoko attempted to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration now the John F. Kennedy School of Government however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first charge d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959 he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self imposed unemployment in Indonesia. After Sukarno was replaced by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in Yogyakarta. Soedjatmoko was born on 10 January 1922 in Sawahlunto, West Sumatra, with the name Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat. He was the eldest son of Saleh Mangoendiningrat, a Javanese physician of noble descent from Madiun, and Isnadikin, a Javanese housewife from Ponorogo the couple had three other children, as well as two adopted children. Soedjatmoko's younger brother, Nugroho Wisnumurti, went on to work at the United Nations. When he was two years old, he and his family moved to the Netherlands after his father received a five year scholarship. After returning to Indonesia, Soedjatmoko continued his studies at an elementary school for European called ELS in Manado, North Sulawesi. Soedjatmoko later attended the Surabaya HBS secondary school and graduated in 1940. The school introduced him to Latin and Greek, and one of his teachers introduced him to European art he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists. He then continued to medical school in Batavia modern day Jakarta . Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta, he was drawn to the issue of poverty this later became an academic interest of his. However, during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah and participation in protests against the occupation. After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and studied Western history and political literature, which led to an interest in socialism. Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein. While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information. In 1946, at the request of Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch language weekly, Het Inzicht Inside , as a counter to the Dutch sponsored Het Utzicht Outlook . The next year, they launched a socialist oriented journal, Siasat Tactics , which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture. In 1947, Sjahrir sent Soedjatmoko to New York as a member of the Indonesian Republic's observer delegation to the United Nations UN . The delegation travelled to the United States via the Philippines after a two month stay in Singapore while in the Philippines, President Manuel Roxas guaranteed support of the nascent nation's case at the United Nations. Soedjatmoko stayed in Lake Success, New York, the temporary location of the UN, and participated in debates over international recognition of the new country. Towards the end of his stay in New York, Soedjatmoko enrolled at Harvard's Littauer Center as, at the time, he was still part of the UN delegation, he commuted between New York and Boston for seven months. After being released from the delegation, he spent most of a year at the Center for a period of three months, however, he was charge d'affaires the nation's first at the Dutch East Indies desk of the Dutch embassy in London, serving in a temporary capacity while the Indonesian embassy was being established. In 1951, Soedjatmoko moved to Washington D.C. to establish the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved to be too much for him and he dropped out of the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly. Upon returning to Indonesia, Soedjatmoko once again became an editor of Siasat. In 1952, he was one of the founders of Socialist Party daily Pedoman Guidance this was followed by a political journal, Konfrontasi Confrontation . He also helped to establish the Pembangunan publishing house, which he directed until 1961. Soedjatmoko joined the Indonesian Socialist Party Partai Sosialis Indonesia, or PSI in 1955, and was elected as a member of Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in the 1955 elections until the dissolution of the assembly in 1959. He served with the Indonesian delegation at the Bandung Conference in 1955. Later the same year, he founded the Indonesian Institute of World Affairs and became its Secretary General for four years. Soedjatmoko married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. Together they had three daughters. Towards the end of the 1950s, Soedjatmoko and President Sukarno, with whom he had had a warm working relationship, had a falling out over the president's increasingly authoritarian policies. In 1960 Soedjatmoko co founded and headed the Democratic League, which attempted to promote democracy in the country he also opposed Sukarno's Guided Democracy policy. When the effort failed, Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at Cornell University. When he returned to Indonesia in 1962, he discovered that key members of the PSI had been arrested and the party banned both Siasat and Pedoman were closed. To avoid trouble with the government, Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965, when he became co editor of An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography. After the failed coup d'etat in 1965 and the replacement of Sukarno by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. He served as vice chairman of the Indonesian delegation at the UN in 1966, becoming the delegation's adviser in 1967. Also in 1967, Soedjatmoko became adviser to foreign minister Adam Malik, as well as a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London based think tank the following year he became Indonesian ambassador to the United States, a position which he held until 1971. During his time as ambassador, Soedjatmoko received honorary doctorates from several American universities, including Cedar Crest College in 1969 and Yale in 1970. He also published another book, Southeast Asia Today and Tomorrow 1969 . Soedjatmoko returned to Indonesia in 1971 upon his return he became Special Adviser on Social and Cultural Affairs to the Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency. That same year, he became a board member of the London based International Institute for Environment and Development, a position which he held until 1976 he also joined the Club of Rome. In 1972 Soedjatmoko was selected to the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, in which position he served 12 years also in 1972 he became a governor of the Asian Institute of Management, a position which he held for two years. The following year he became a governor of the International Development Research Center. In 1974, based on falsified documents, he was accused of planning the Malari incident of January 1974, in which students protested and eventually rioted during a state visit by Prime Minister of Japan Kakuei Tanaka. Held for interrogation for two and a half weeks, Soedjatmoko was not allowed to leave Indonesia for two and a half years for his suspected involvement. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, often called Asia's Nobel Prize. The citation read, in part Encouraging both Asians and outsiders to look more carefully at the village folkways they would modernize, is fostering awareness of the human dimension essential to all development. ... is writings have added consequentially to the body of international thinking on what can be done to meet one of the greatest challenges of our time how to make life more decent and satisfying for the poorest 40 percent in Southeastern and southern Asia. In response, Soedjatmoko said he felt humbled, because of awareness that whatever small contribution may have made is dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem of persistent poverty and human suffering in Asia, and by the realization of how much still remains to be done. In 1980 Soedjatmoko moved to Tokyo, Japan. In September of that year he began service as the rector of the United Nations University, replacing James M. Hester he remained in that position until 1987. In Japan he published two further books, The Primacy of Freedom in Development and Development and Freedom. He received the Asia Society Award in 1985, and the Universities Field Staff International Award for Distinguished Service to the Advancement of International Understanding the following year. Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest on 21 December 1989 when he was lecturing at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soedjatmoko
"Soeman Hasibuan Perfected Spelling Suman Hasibuan 4 April 1904 8 May 1999 better known by his pen name Soeman Hs, was an Indonesian author recognized for pioneering detective fiction and short story writing in the country's literature. Born in Bengkalis, Riau, Dutch East Indies, to a family of farmers, Soeman studied to become a teacher and, under the author Mohammad Kasim , a writer. He began working as a Malay language teacher after completing normal school in 1923, first in Siak Sri Indrapura, Aceh, then in Pasir Pengaraian, Rokan Hulu, Riau. Around this time he began writing, publishing his first novel, Kasih Tak Terlarai, in 1929. In twelve years he published five novels, one short story collection, and thirty five short stories and poems. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies 19421945 and subsequent revolution, Soemanthough he remained a teacherbecame active in politics, serving first on a representatives' council and then as part of the Indonesian National Committee for Pasir Pengaraian in Pekanbaru. Following the Netherlands' recognition of Indonesia's independence in 1949, Soeman was made the head of the regional department of education, working to rebuild damaged infrastructure and to establish new schools, including the first senior high school in Riau and the Islamic University of Riau . He remained active in education until his death. As an author, Soeman wrote stories which emphasized suspense and humour, drawing on Western detective and adventure fiction as well as classical Malay literature. His written Malay, with a vocabulary heavily influenced by his east Sumatran background, flowed readily and avoided excessive verbosity. Soeman's most popular work was his novel Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan 1932 , whereas his short story collection Kawan Bergeloet 1941 has been considered his most interesting from a literary perspective. Though considered a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period, Soeman has been recognized with an eponymous library and his books have been taught at schools. Soeman was born in Bengkalis, Riau, Dutch East Indies, in 1904. His father, Wahid Hasibuan, and mother, Turumun Lubis, had been born in Kotanopan in what is now Mandailing Natal , but moved to Bengkalis after marriage to avoid conflict between the Hasibuans and a rival clan. In a 1989 interview, Soeman stated that he was not sure of the conflict's source, but he suspected that his father, who was descended from a Mandailing king, felt as though his honour had been impugned. In Bengkalis, Wahid and Turumun farmed pineapples and coconuts. Wahid also taught Quran reading, which provided supplementary income for the Muslim family. As his father taught at their home, Soeman began learning to read the Quran at a young age. Meanwhile, from the traders who visited Wahid, he also heard stories of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where his teachers reinforced the importance of reading. Soeman took this lesson to heart, reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918. Hoping to become a teacher, Soeman tried out for a course for potential teachers in Medan, North Sumatra, soon after graduation. After he was accepted, he spent two years studying in that city. Among his teachers was Mohammad Kasim , whose later short story collection Teman Doedoek 1937 became the first such work in the Indonesian literary canon. Outside of class, Soeman would listen to Kasim's stories about authors and the creative writing process this sparked his interest in becoming a writer. After two years in Medan, Soeman continued to a normal school in Langsa, Aceh, where he stayed until 1923. There he met his future wife, Siti Hasnah. After graduation, Soeman found employment at HIS Siak Sri Indrapura, a Dutch language school for indigenous students in Siak Sri Indrapura, Aceh. Soeman worked as a Malay language teacher there for seven years, until 1930, when he met a young teacher from Java who was involved in the nationalist movement. Soeman and several other teachers joined him for discussion and to furtively play the song Indonesia Raya , which was under a ban from the Dutch colonial government. When this was discovered, Soeman was transferred to Pasir Pengaraian, Rokan Hulu, Riau. Despite repeated requests for transfer, Soeman remained in Pasir Pengaraian until the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in 1942, eventually being made principal. Soeman began writing in 1923, shortly after finishing his studies. Inspired by his father, who stopped using the clan name Hasibuan in Malay dominated Bengkalis, he took the pen name Soeman Hs. He submitted his first novel, Kasih Tak Terlarai Undivided Love , to the state publisher Balai Pustaka. The book, about a young orphan who elopes with his beloved but must remarry her in disguise after she returns home, was published in 1929. Soeman received a total of 37 gulden for the publication. This was followed by Pertjobaan Setia A Test of Faithfulness in 1931, a novel about a young man named Sjamsoeddin who is required to go on the hajj before he can marry Hajjah Salwiah, a rich merchant's daughter. When Sjamsoeddin returns from his trip, he suffers an accident and is tricked by a man who lusts after Salwiah. Ultimately, however, Sjamsoeddin's friend Djamin is able to reveal the treachery, allowing Sjamsoeddin and Salwiah to marry. The following year, two translations of Soeman's novels were published by Balai Pustaka Kasih Tak Terlarai was translated into Javanese as Asih tan Kena Pisah by Soehardja, while Pertjobaan Setia was translated into Sundanese as Tjotjoba by Martaperdana. Soeman published another novel, Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan Seeking a Maiden's Kidnapper , in 1932. It follows Sir Joon, a man whose betrothal to Nona was called off after her father, Gadi, was offered a higher bride price. When Nona is apparently kidnapped, Joon offers his services to help find her. He builds distrust between Gadi and Nona's would be husband, and ultimately that betrothal too is called off. Afterwards Joon leaves the village with Nona, whom he had taken from her home, and the couple lives happily in Singapore. For this novel, again published by Balai Pustaka, Soeman received 75 gulden. Over the subsequent decades, it became his most popular publication, and it has been identified as the first detective novel in the Indonesian literary canon. Between 1932 and 1938, Soeman published two further novels, Kasih Tersesat Lost Love serialized in Pandji Poestaka in 1932 and Teboesan Darah Blood Payment published in Doenia Pengalaman in 1939 . This latter novel marked the return of Sir Joon, who had featured in several other detective stories by other authors. Soeman also published thirty five short stories and poems, mostly in the magazine Pandji Poestaka but also in Pedoman Masjarakat and Poedjangga Baroe. Seven of Soeman's Pandji Poestaka stories were compiled in Kawan Bergeloet Playmate , together with five original stories. With this collection, published in 1941, Soeman became one of the first short story writers in the Indonesian literary canon. After the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman was made a school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shusangikai, a Japanese sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, because he had been elected rather than selected by the Japanese forcesand thus had strong backing among the community, which could be used for revolutionhe had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia. Though the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence was made on 17 August 1945, news did not reach Riau until September. In the following months, Soeman was elected to the newly formed Indonesian National Committee for Pasir Pengaraian, and later made its chairman. In this capacity, he had to strike a balance between former colonial staff who were looking forward to a Dutch return and those who supported an independent Indonesia Dutch forces were returning to Java, and physical conflict had already broken out between Allied forces and the Indonesian republicans in Surabaya. The following year, Soeman was elected to the Regional Representatives' Council for Riau, based out of Pekanbaru. Following Operation Kraai in 1948, in which Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and captured much of the Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau. Aside from continuing the fight, he was tasked with finding new fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long term schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. Though his troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch allied indigene troops several times. Once the revolution concluded following the DutchIndonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru and made the head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. Desks had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on voluntary contributions from the populace. This was followed by a period of building further education infrastructure. To help elementary school teachers further their studies, Soeman took part in establishing a private junior high school in 1953. The following year he helped establish the Setia Dharma Senior High School, the first senior high school in Riau. Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony, where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared that the people of Riau had been treated like stepchildren. He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma. Though Yamin objected to Soeman's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma, he did arrange for a state senior high school to be opened in Riau. Soeman continued working to establish new schools in Riau. In the late 1950s, seeing the development of schools by Christian organizations, Soeman, working with other Muslims in Riau, began establishing Islamic schools at the kindergarten, elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level. In 1961, Governor of Riau Kaharuddin Nasution approached Soeman and asked him to join the Daily Governance Body of the provincial government. He did so and, working with the government, the Islamic Education Foundation established the Islamic University of Riau . Soeman conducted the formal inauguration ceremony in 1962. Though he had formally retired as a teacher to join the Daily Governance Body, from the 1960s Soeman was involved with several education foundations. He served as general director of the Institutions of Islamic Education Foundation as well as the chairman of the Setia Dharma managing board, the Riau Education Foundation, and the Riau Social and Cultural Society. He also maintained ties with the provincial government in 1966, he formally became part of the Regional Representatives' Council, and in 1976, at the recommendation of Governor Arifin Achmad, he went on the hajj using state funds. Soeman died in Pekanbaru on 8 May 1999, having remained active in various aspects of education in Riau until the previous year. Soeman credited the adventure stories of Alexandre Dumas and similar authors, which he read in translation, for his interest in the adventure and detective genres. Soeman was interested in these stories' use of suspense, which set them apart from the works of traditionally influenced Malay authors such as Marah Rusli. According to the cultural critic Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Soeman, in his construction of suspense, mimicked that of Western detective stories, rather than adapt the style for an Eastern setting. Traditional influences did surface in Soeman's works, however. He credited his short stories' comedic elements to the humorous aspects of Malay folk literature such as the Lebai Malan Unfortunate Quranic Teacher tales. The poet Eka Budianta notes that a common theme in Soeman's works was the strength of love and its ability to overcome obstacles. Soeman wrote of the power of romance and marriage for love in response to the treatment of women in adat traditional culture. Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption. Some of Soeman's characters are not identified as indigenous Indonesians, including Nona her name being common among the ethnic Chinese and Sir Joon a Eurasian . This was, in part, a bid to attract readers of different cultural backgrounds, as well as those living in Singapore. It also served to soften Soeman's criticism. In an interview, Soeman recalled My stories always challenged the stiff adat. So to show this, my characters were always outsiders, who could be better accepted if they went against adat. That was my strategy, as an author, so my stories could be accepted. Soeman's diction in his short stories was strongly influenced by his east Sumatran background, with extensive Malay vocabulary and less Javanese influence than many contemporary writers. However, as with his fellow writers of the Poedjangga Baroe generation, he avoided frequently using classical Malay terms such as alkisah 'it is told' and maka 'thus' . He was critical of the extensive verbosity of earlier literature, instead attempting to use a more succinct and direct style and avoid embellishments. In a 1936 article, Alisjahbana wrote that, in Soeman's hands, the stiff and frozen, heavily formalised, Malay language becomes fluid again . Soeman's works were often used for teaching literature to junior and senior high school students, particularly in Riau, where in the 1970s they were distributed by the provincial government. One of Soeman's short stories, Papan Reklame Billboards , was included in a Cornell University Press published reader for foreign students of Indonesian, and HB Jassin included one of Soeman's poems, Iman Faith , in the anthology Pudjangga Baroe 1963 . In 1993, Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan was adapted into a television serial by August Melasz. Towards the end of Soeman's life, his books were only rarely republished and discussed, and a 2014 profile by the Tanjungpinang Center for Preserving Cultural Values describes Soeman as a forgotten educator and writer. However, Soeman's works are still anthologized, and in 2008 the Soeman Hs Library in Pekanbaru was named for him. Designed to resemble a rehal and thus reflect Islamic Malay culture, the six storey, glass walled library is operated by the government of Riau. In 2010, the Sagang Foundation posthumously awarded Soeman the Sagang Kencana Prize for his dedication to preserving Malay culture. Soeman has been categorized as a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw writes that, though Soeman's poetry maintained a conventional form, his detective stories were unpretentious but pleasantly written . However, he considers Soeman's short story collection, Kawan Bergeloet, his most interesting contribution to literature, owing to its well observed and realistically described sketches. Alisjahbana, meanwhile, praised Soeman's innovative use of Malay but considered the author's plotlines to be at times inconsequential and illogical, with the narrative acting as a child who quick as lightning shows his toys, then hides them again to pique his friends' curiosity . He considered Soeman's work best read for its entertainment value. In a film commemorating Soeman made by the Lontar Foundation, Budianta concluded You can say he only wrote a few works. You can say that his works are not that popular, not that monumental, but the presence of Soeman Hs as a writer of humorous and detective stories cannot be ignored. If we try to tell of the pioneers of humour and detective fiction, well Soeman Hs was their father. He can be considered the father of humorous and detective stories.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soeman%20Hs
"Mr. Raden Soeprapto 27 March 1894 2 December 1964 was the fourth Attorney General of Indonesia. Born in Trenggalek, East Java, Soeprapto studied law in Jakarta, finding work in the legal system soon after graduating in 1920. After transferring often, in the early 1940s he had reached Pekalongan and become the head of the court for Native Indonesians. Escaping Pekalongan during Operatie Product with the help of a prisoner he had just sentenced, Soeprapto made his way to Yogyakarta and began to work as a prosecutor. When the government moved to Jakarta in 1950, Soeprapto went with it. In January 1951, he was selected to be Prosecutor General of Indonesia, serving until 1 April 1959. As prosecutor general, Soeprapto was noted for trying state ministers and generals despite them outranking him, a quality which Amir Hasan Ketaren of the Prosecutors' Commission finds lacking from subsequent officeholders. He was declared Father of the Prosecutor's Office on 22 July 1967, with a bust of him erected outside the Prosecutor General's Office. Soeprapto was born in Trenggalek, East Java, Dutch East Indies on 27 March 1894 to Hadiwiloyo, a tax collector, and his wife. He took his elementary studies at a Europesche Lagere School, then considered better than schools for Native Indonesians, eventually graduating in 1914. He then moved to Batavia modern day Jakarta , where he studied at Rechtschool with future state minister Wongsonegoro. After graduating from the Rechtschool in 1920, Soeprapto went directly to working at the Landraad court for Native Indonesians in his hometown. For fifteen years he worked at Landraad in various locations, including in Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, and Denpasar. He eventually rose to Head of the Landraad in Cirebon and Kuningan, serving from 1937 to 1941. From there, he transferred to the Landraad for Salatiga and Boyolali, then to Besuki, before settling as head of the landraad in Pekalongan. While in Pekalongan, Soeprapto befriended a local prosecutor Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo, father of Hoegeng. Although Soeprapto was able to lead the court peacefully during the Japanese occupation, after the start of the Indonesian National Revolution the situation in Pekalongan became unstable. Although the nascent army was able to hold the peace during riots at the end of 1945, when the Dutch began a major assault on Java, Soeprapto was forced to flee south to Indonesian held areas with his family. In this, Soeprapto was assisted by Kutil, a man whom he had only recently sentenced to death, and Kutil's other captive accomplices. Soeprapto's wife later remembered that Kutil and his men had carried briefcases containing paperwork related to their cases ... and even Soeprapto's children, without showing any vengeance. Although Kutil and his men escaped after evacuating, they were later recaptured, with Soeprapto serving as a witness against them. After his escape from Pekalongan, Soeprapto and his family first went to Cirebon. They then went to Yogyakarta, where Soeprapto became a judge at the high court. He later began work as a prosecutor, rising quickly through the ranks several of his coworkers attributed it to the Kutil case, where Soeprapto demonstrated that he believed in the supremacy of law. In 1950, Soeprapto returned to Jakarta and continued his work as a prosecutor. In January 1951, he was chosen to replace Tirtawinata as Prosecutor General of Indonesia. At the time, the prosecutor general's office was a division of the Ministry of Justice, and as such Soeprapto was under the Minister of Justice. During his time as prosecutor general, Soeprapto handled several high profile cases, going after ministers and generals that outranked him politically. In 1953, he brought Sultan Hamid II, then a minister without portfolio, to trial for his involvement in the APRA Coup d'etat Hamid was sentenced to 10 years in prison by Supreme Court Justice Wirjono Prodjodikoro on 8 April 1953. Soeprapto also investigated Head of the Armed Forces Abdul Haris Nasution for his involvement in the affair. Other cases included the trials of revolutionary groups and foreigners accused of undermining the Indonesian government. He also oversaw an increasing number of prosecutors, drawn from Indonesian law schools. However, Soeprapto also came into conflict with Minister of Justice Moeljatno over the role of the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, under the control of the Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957. After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably dismissed on 1 April 1959. the dismissal has been reported in several sources to be related to the acquittal of dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime. Soeprapto married three times. He first married Soeratinah of Purworejo, with whom he had a son. He then married Djenab Oetari of Bogor, with whom he had a daughter. His last marriage was to Soekarti, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He died on 2 December 1964, and was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta. Soeprapto was posthumously declared the Father of the Prosecutor's Office on 22 July 1967 by Prosecutor General Soegiharto, which was formally recognized by Letter of Recommendation Number KEP 061 D.A 1967. That same year, a bust of him was placed in front of the prosecutor general's office in Jakarta. Several streets are named after Soeprapto, including in Gresik, Malang, and Surabaya. Amir Hasan Ketaren of the Prosecutors' Commission stated in 2010 that Soeprapto was an example of what a prosecutor general should be firm, knowledgeable, and unwilling to allow outside intervention in his investigations even from the president. This quality, he said, was lacking in subsequent officeholders. The following year, Asvi Warman Adam of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences stated that there had yet to be another prosecutor general like Soeprapto, for rather than investigating cases of corruption and keeping politics out of the position subsequent holders of the office had often been corrupt themselves.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soeprapto%20%28prosecutor%29
"Soft Cuddly is a horror arcade adventure game released for the ZX Spectrum home computer, developed by John George Jones and published by The Power House. It was released in September 1987 in the United Kingdom and in early 1988 in Spain. The player assumes the role of a man armed with a laser gun and a jet pack, whose mother, the Android Queen, has been dismembered. The player's task is to locate the scattered body parts of the Android Queen and sew her back together. Jones had previously developed a game called Go to Hell. In an interview he stated that he developed the game for his own amusement he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others. Soft Cuddly is a surreal arcade adventure game set in a fantasy horror world of 256 rooms. The player controls the son of the Android Queen. The Queen has imprisoned her husband, the player character's father, in a refrigerator. The Queen has been dismembered in an accident, leaving her husband in danger of being attacked by evil spirits. The object of the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back together again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen. The location of the refrigerator is randomized at the beginning of each new game. The game world consists of a number of rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location. Soft Cuddly was developed for The Power house by John George Jones. Jones had previously developed Go to Hell for Triple Six. Go to Hell was published in 1985 and featured ...revolting, crude and downright vile images. When interviewed by Sinclair User, in the October 1987 issue, the programmer was asked Whatever possessed you to write a game like Soft and Cuddly... . To this Jones responded, I didn't write the game because I'm a horrible person, I wrote it to amuse myself. Jones also stated I love the reaction people give, I can't stand 'nice' inoffensive things... . The original version of the game was more gruesome the babies were being torn apart rather than stretched and ...the sheep was bouncing up and down on a corpse. When asked how long he would retain interest in computers, Jones stated that he had already lost interest. Soft Cuddly was released by The Power house during September 1987 in the United Kingdom. The game was later released in Spain during the first quarter of 1988. The game featured in a competition printed in the November 1987 issue of Sinclair User. The first prize was a day in the company of The Power House's staff including a trip to the London Dungeon. Other prize winners received a copy of Soft Cuddly or a poster of the game's inlay artwork. Soft Cuddly received average review scores from critics. The game's graphics were praised Sinclair User reviewer Jim Douglas stated Graphically, it is certainly unusual, and occasionally brilliant. Crash magazine's three reviewers also praised the graphics but raised some issues. Nick Roberts described them as smooth and slick, but stated that they were a mite sketchy . Roberts also stated colour is used very well. Paul Sumner stated There are some cleverly animated and attractively coloured graphics . Robin Candy said they are the game's greatest asset. Reviewers held differing opinions on the game's setting and themes. Sumner stated the game is dragged down by distasteful graphics and a horribly grim inlay. Roberts described the game as sick , adding I only recommend Soft Cuddly to those of you who cut your toenails with a carving knife Douglas was critical of the game's themes he described playing Soft Cuddly as watching very large and unpleasant graphics jigging up and down like a box of offal . Tony Lee of Your Sinclair was more positive, stating, This is a very sick game indeed, but fortunately I have a very sick sense of humour. The overall game received a more positive reception from Lee and MicroHobby magazine's reviewer as opposed to the reviewers from Crash and Sinclair User. MicroHobby's reviewer called Soft Cuddly a typical arcade adventure with a performance worthy of a horror movie. Douglas stated, The actual playing of the game is, unfortunately, a rather tiresome business. He criticized the game for consisting of character movement coupled with occasional item gathering. Douglas described the game's enemies as being bog standard cannon fodder aliens , saying they drift around being annoying and sapping your energy. Candy stated that It's very easy to get into, but boring. He added that exploration is the best part of the game but becomes repetitive. Sumner stated all there is to Soft Cuddly is graphics. The gameplay is repetitive. Lee said that the game is fun I love this one.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft%20%26%20Cuddly
"Soft Light is the twenty third episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X Files. It originally aired on the Fox network on May 5, 1995. It was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner. The episode is a Monster of the Week story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology, or overarching fictional history. Soft Light received a Nielsen rating of 8.5 and was watched by 8.1 million households. The episode generally received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder David Duchovny and Dana Scully Gillian Anderson who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X Files. In this episode, an ex student of Scully's Kate Twa asks the agents to help her with her first investigation concerning a number of disappearances with very few clues. Mulder ponders the idea of spontaneous human combustion but rethinks it when they find a man, Chester Ray Banton Tony Shalhoub , who is afraid of his own shadow. Banton is a scientist researching dark matter, and his shadow has somehow developed the ability to disintegrate people who come across it. Soft Light was the first The X Files episode written by Gilligan, who would go on to write several acclaimed episodes such as Pusher , Bad Blood and Memento Mori . Soft Light was one of the first episodes written by someone not on the main writing staff for The X Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow to be able to move independently, but it was rewritten to save on animation costs. In addition, the character of X Steven Williams was not in the script initially. His character was added to give Banton a legitimate fear of the government. At a hotel in Richmond, Virginia, Chester Ray Banton Tony Shalhoub reaches a room and frantically knocks on the door while shouting the name Morris. Banton's shouts attract the attention of Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his shadow to slip beneath Newirth's door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene. The case of Newirth's death, the latest in several of its kind, is assigned to local detective Kelly Ryan Kate Twa . She seeks help from Dana Scully Gillian Anderson , her former instructor at the FBI Academy. Fox Mulder David Duchovny also takes part in the investigation, believing Newirth died from spontaneous human combustion. While searching the home of an earlier victim, the agents realize that both she and Newirth had recently traveled by train. Meanwhile, Banton sits in a train station, cautiously looking at the floor because the room is lit by soft light, his shadow cannot be seen. After he leaves, Banton is confronted by two police officers patrolling the area. Despite Banton's warnings, the officers step into his shadow and disappear, leaving more burn marks. The following day, while reviewing the station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton staring at the floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. At Polarity Magnetics, the agents meet scientist Christopher Davey Kevin McNulty , who identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory in which he was locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles. His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory. The agents find Banton at the train station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He declares that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself to be taken to a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Ryan and her superior stop the questioning and declare the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X Steven Williams , who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, X's associates are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital. Banton returns to Polarity Magnetics and is confronted by Ryan, whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when she tries to arrest him. Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the particle accelerator, but Davey reveals that he has been helping the government hunt him down. Davey locks Banton in with the particle accelerator, but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after, seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him, and tells X to never contact him again. The case is considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton. Soft Light was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner. Prior to writing this episode, Gilligan, who had long been a fan of the show, learned that his agent was a relative of series creator Chris Carter. Thanks to this connection, he was allowed to meet Carter. During this meet, Carter asked Gilligan if he had any episode ideas, to which quickly noted that he had been observing his shadow and thought it would be creepy if it began moving independently. Carter asked Gilligan to develop a script based on the idea as a freelance project although when the episode was finished, Carter offered Gilligan a job as a permanent writer . This episode was thus one of the first episodes to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow to be able to move independently Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect, which ended up sav an enormous amount of money in animation costs , according to Gilligan. After reading the first draft, Carter also felt that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be more than just paranoia . He thus wrote X into the story writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, It had been a long time since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow. Gilligan himself inserted a reference to the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first season episodes Squeeze and Tooms in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode guest stars Tony Shalhoub as Dr. Banton. Shalhoub, who had a recurring role on the NBC series Wings, was not familiar with The X Files when he was offered the part because at the time he did not watch much television. However, after reading the script for Soft Light , he enjoyed the story due to its The Twilight Zone esque nature. When Shalhoub informed people that he had secured a part in The X Files, he claimed that the response was unbelievable . Shalhoub was impressed with the on location filming that the series did he noted, Ninety nine percent of our filming on Wings is done on a soundstage, while most of The X Files is shot on location in and around Vancouver. It's an ideal city because it gives producers so many options. Both the Pacific Central Station and the Pacific Marine Training Institute in Vancouver stood in for the train station featured in the episode. Initially, the Pacific Marine Training Institute would only give the series permission to film after 5pm, but the show's producers eventually talked the dean of the station into letting production begin at 2 in the afternoon. Because he was a fan of the series, Gilligan traveled to Vancouver and video recorded the filming of Soft Light . Soft Light was originally aired in the United States on the Fox Broadcasting Company on May 5, 1995, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on February 13, 1996 on BBC One. In its original broadcast, it was watched by 8.1 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received an 8.5 rating and 15 share among viewers, meaning that 8.5 percent of all households in the United States and 15 percent of all people watching television at the time, viewed the episode. Soft Light received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B and noted that the episode gains points for the obscure subject matter but loses them for the strained conspiratorial element . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also gave it a B . He praised the cold open for its strangeness and X's involvement, but thought that the explanation for Banton's shadow was not satisfactorily fleshed out. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe A Critical Guide to The X Files, Millennium The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the episode's case, calling it one wherein Mulder and Scully get to investigate properly, coming up with theories that they later build on or retract. Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the episode's conclusion, noting that there's no better illustration for distrusting the government than the brilliant closing scene which features Shalhoub fixed to a chair, bombarded with flashes of light, as one single tear rolls down his terrified face. Other reviews were decidedly more critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 5 out of 10 and wrote, Overall, this episode falls short due to a completely ludicrous central concept, only partially countered by an interesting resolution highlighting the more sinister side of Informant X. Much like last seasons final few episodes, this season is ending with plenty of hints that Mulder and Scully are pushing the wrong buttons.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft%20Light%20%28The%20X-Files%29
"The Soft Parade is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Doors, released on July 18, 1969 by Elektra Records. Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors' first three albums develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer Jim Morrison, who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, leaving guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, but it failed to retain audiences in the UK and other European countries that their previous album, Waiting for the Sun, had succeeded in engaging. Three preceding singles, Touch Me , Wishful Sinful , and Tell All the People , were included on The Soft Parade, with the former becoming another Top 10 hit for the Doors. Another single, Runnin' Blue , also followed the album's distribution. Upon release, The Soft Parade was denounced by both music critics and the band's underground music scene followers, who viewed the album as the Doors' trending into popular music. Over time, historians have reassessed the album and its critical standing has slightly improved, but it is still widely considered the group's weakest effort with Morrison. By mid 1968, the Doors had established themselves as one of the most popular groups in the US. The band's third studio album, Waiting for the Sun, released in July of the same year, became the Doors' only number one hit on the Billboard 200, while also spawning their second single to peak at number one with Hello, I Love You . The album was the first commercial breakthrough for the band in the UK, reaching number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. After the release of Waiting for the Sun, the Doors commanded vast sums of money to perform before large crowds in arenas such as the L.A. Forum, the Hollywood Bowl, and Madison Square Garden. Additionally, local Los Angeles Top 40 radio stations, particularly KHJ Radio, which had previously refused to play the band's records, began sponsoring the Doors' live performances. On September 2, 1968, the group played dates in Europe, along with Jefferson Airplane, before ending their long, grueling touring schedule with nine concerts back in the US. While the 1968 tours managed to capitalize on the chart success of Waiting for the Sun, it also left little time for the Doors to compose new songs for The Soft Parade, having already exhausted all the material from Morrison's songbooks. Morrison, a self professed acid evangelist of rock , had been fascinated with the public media outlets and frequently coined buzzwords and phrases to generate attention for the Doors. The band's rise to stardom and publications drawing Morrison as a sex symbol, however, drastically modified his outlook on pop culture. Throughout 1968, Morrison's behavior became increasingly erratic he began drinking heavily and distanced himself from studio work to focus on his more immediate passions, poetry and film making. At the time, Morrison was also struggling with anxiety, and felt like he was on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He considered quitting the Doors, but was persuaded by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to finish recording The Soft Parade before making such a decision. In November 1968, the band entered the newly established studio Elektra Sound West on La Cienega Boulevard to commence work on The Soft Parade, a process that was not complete until June 1969. Without any album ready material to work with, record producer Paul A. Rothchild took control of the recording sessions and insisted on numerous retakes of songs, much to the group's indignation. It was like pulling teeth to get Jim into it , sound engineer Bruce Botnick recalled. It was bizarre ... the hardest I ever worked as a producer. Rothchild, who by this time was addicted to cocaine and incredibly strict in his leadership, caused severe strife in the studio, especially with his advisor Jac Holzman, who argued the drive for perfection was grinding them into the ground . The album was by far the most expensive by the group, costing US 80,000 to create in contrast to the US 10,000 required for their debut. The Doors wanted to capitalize on the experimental climate in popular music at the time that brought about groundbreaking works like The Beatles' The White Album and Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, while redefining what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated art rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept We'd always talk about using some jazz musicians let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see what it would be like to record with a string section and a big horn section , recalled Manzarek. Although Morrison was less involved in the Doors' studio sessions at this point, he demanded the band receive individual writing credits after initially refusing to sing Krieger's lyric, Can't you see me growing, get your guns on the track Tell All the People . As a result, The Soft Parade was the first Doors album to list band members separately rather than collectively as Songs by the Doors . Krieger continued to hone his songwriting skills to fill the void left by Morrison's absence. He wrote half of the album's tracks, while Morrison is credited with the other half they share co credits on Do It , ultimately creating an album that lacks the unified musical stance found on the Doors' early works. Krieger's songs, written almost independently from the rest of the band, most noticeably incorporated the jazz influences that had been a part of the prevailing trend of popular rock music. Only his tracks, Tell All the People , Touch Me , Runnin' Blue , and Wishful Sinful , were written to include string and horn arrangements Morrison, though not totally opposed to the concept, declined to go in the direction Densmore and Manzarek championed. Touch Me penned under the working titles Hit Me and I'm Gonna Love You was chosen as the first single taken from The Soft Parade, becoming one of the Doors' biggest hits. The band brought in the saxophone player Curtis Amy to perform a solo instrumental on the song, which was influenced by the works of John Coltrane. Morrison's Shaman's Blues and the title track were both examples of his penchant for using symbolism and autobiographical insights. The latter song, a stylistic return to a lengthy track closing a Doors album, was penned with the help of Rothchild who organized pieces of Morrison's poetry with him to align rhythmically and conceptually. Introduced with a mock fiery sermon by Morrison, The Soft Parade displays his Southern roots through his portrayal as a preacher. The song's ambiance is heightened by the striking imagery which outlines a need for sanctuary, escape, and pleasure. Critic Doug Sundling noted that The Soft Parade , with its display of acid rock and sunshine pop influences, is more diverse than any other Morrison composition. The Soft Parade was released on July 18, 1969. It peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, during a chart stay of 28 weeks, but fared poorly in the UK where the album failed to reach the charts. The album's front cover photograph was taken by Joel Brodsky, who had also been responsible for the cover of the Doors' debut album and Strange Days. Three singles had already been released prior to the album's distribution, much more than usual for a Doors album. The Touch Me single was released in December 1968 and became one of the band's biggest hits, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Two additional singles, Wishful Sinful and Tell All the People , were also distributed but fared less favorably, peaking at numbers 44 and 57 respectively. Following the release of The Soft Parade, the Doors earned another minor hit with the Runnin' Blue single, charting at number 64 upon its release in August 1969. Although the album was a success at establishing the Doors in the pop market, it was rejected by the group's original audience and the underground scene, particularly for the album's use of horns and strings. The underground press was less than complimentary, with David Walkey, writing in New York's East Village Other, stating the album was badly messed up by the syrupy arrangement of Paul Rothchild and could be renamed, 'The Rothchild Strings Play the Doors' . Another scathing review by Miller Francis Jr. of The Great Speckled Bird expressed disdain for the Doors' attempt at art rock, feeling The Soft Parade comes on so pretentious, like something written rather than something sung . Rob Cline of Northwest Passage questioned why a band like the Doors needed to record with violins and trombones when the group was best when getting it on straight and hard as witness to their first two albums . In Rolling Stone, Alec Dubro found much of the songs to be pale shadows of their earlier works . Reviewing for The Village Voice in January 1970, Robert Christgau wrote No one even thinks about the Doors any moresuch is famebut this is an acceptable record, with predictable pretensions and two or three first rate songs 'Touch Me,' 'Wild Child' . Nothing to get excited about, either way. Writer Richard Riegel evaluated the immediate impact of The Soft Parade on the Doors' reputation in the magazine Creem in 1981 If Waiting for the Sun set a lot of older hippies to questioning their former perceptions of the Doors as Avatars of the avant garde, then The Soft Parade finished off their interest in the group. In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger was slightly more positive, writing that about half the record is quite good, especially the huge hit 'Touch Me' their most successful integration of orchestration . However, Unterberger felt it is the weakest studio album recorded with Jim Morrison , as well as their weakest set of material, low lights including filler like 'Do It' and 'Runnin' Blue' . Writer James Riordan opined that, compared to prior albums, Morrison's contributions to The Soft Parade were lackluster, putting his credibility as a serious poet and songwriter on the line. Author Danny Sugerman in No One Here Gets Out Alive wrote overall the lyric impact was less than it had been on previous albums...horns by some of the top local studio jazz musicians further blurred the once lucid Doors sound . . A notable exception in reviewing the 40th anniversary remix for the August, 2007 issue of Downbeat Magazine correspondent Dan Ouellette declared it to be the apex of the band's creativity. The Soft Parade was remastered at 24 bit resolution by Botnick in 1999. It was reissued on the Perception box set in 2006 with a clip of the Doors performing the title track live. As a part of the group's 40th Anniversary album series, a remastered and remixed The Soft Parade was released on March 27, 2007. The album includes six bonus tracks, including the rarities Whisky, Mystics, and Men and Push Push .

"Sogdia sdi Sogdian sod or Sogdiana was an ancient Iranian civilization that at different times included territory located in present day Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, such as Samarkand, Bukhara, Khujand, Panjikent, and Shahrisabz. Sogdiana was also a province of the Achaemenid Empire, eighteenth in the list on the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great i. 16 . In the Avesta, Sogdiana is listed as the second best land that the supreme deity Ahura Mazda had created. It comes second, after Airyanem Vaejah, homeland of the Aryans , in the Zoroastrian book of Vendidad, indicating the importance of this region from ancient times. Sogdiana was first conquered by Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire. The region would then be annexed by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great in 328 BC. The region would continue to change hands under the Seleucid Empire, Greco Bactrian Kingdom, Kushan Empire, Hephthalite Empire, and Sasanian Empire. The Sogdian states, although never politically united, were centred on the main city of Samarkand. Sogdiana lay north of Bactria, east of Khwarezm, and southeast of Kangju between the Oxus Amu Darya and the Jaxartes Syr Darya , embracing the fertile valley of the Zeravshan ancient Polytimetus . Sogdian territory corresponds to the modern provinces of Samarkand and Bokhara in modern Uzbekistan as well as the Sughd province of modern Tajikistan. During the High Middle Ages, Sogdian cities included sites stretching towards Issyk Kul such as that at the archeological site of Suyab. Sogdian, an Eastern Iranian language, is no longer a spoken language, but its direct descendant, Yaghnobi, is still spoken by the Yaghnobis of Tajikistan. It was widely spoken in Central Asia as a lingua franca and even served as one of the Turkic Khaganate's court languages for writing documents. Sogdians also lived in Imperial China and rose to special prominence in the military and government of the Chinese Tang dynasty 618907 AD . Sogdian merchants and diplomats traveled as far west as the Byzantine Empire. They played an important part as middlemen in the trade route of the Silk Road. While originally following the faiths of Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Buddhism, and to a lesser extent, Nestorian Christianity from West Asia, the gradual conversion to Islam among the Sogdians and their descendants began with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana in the 8th century. The Sogdian conversion to Islam was virtually complete by the end of the Samanid Empire in 999, coinciding with the decline of the Sogdian language, as it was largely supplanted by Persian. Oswald Szemerenyi devotes a thorough discussion to the etymologies of ancient ethnic words for the Scythians in his work Four Old Iranian Ethnic Names Scythian Skudra Sogdian Saka. In it, the names provided by the Greek historian Herodotus and the names of his title, except Saka, as well as many other words for Scythian, such as Assyrian Askuz and Greek Skuthes, descend from skeud , an ancient Indo European root meaning propel, shoot cf. English shoot . skud is the zero grade that is, a variant in which the e is not present. The restored Scythian name is Skuda archer , which among the Pontic or Royal Scythians became Skula, in which the d has been regularly replaced by an l. According to Szemerenyi, Sogdiana Old Persian Suguda Uzbek Sug'd, Sug'diyona Persian Sogd Tajik , Sugd Chinese Mandarin sute Ancient Greek was named from the Skuda form. Starting from the names of the province given in Old Persian inscriptions, Sugda and Suguda, and the knowledge derived from Middle Sogdian that Old Persian gd applied to Sogdian was pronounced as voiced fricatives, , Szemerenyi arrives at Sua as an Old Sogdian endonym. Applying sound changes apparent in other Sogdian words and inherent in Indo European he traces the development of Sua from Skuda, archer, as follows Skuda Sukuda by anaptyxis Sukua Suka syncope Sua assimilation . Centuries before the conquest of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was gradually displaced by the Indo European migrations of the Iron Age. This large scale migration included Eastern Iranian speaking peoples such as the Sogdians. The original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, Tajikistan, spanning as far back as the 4th millennium BC and then at Kok Tepe, near modern day Bulungur, Uzbekistan, from at least the 15th century BC. Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great conquered Sogdiana while campaigning in Central Asia in 546539 BC, a fact mentioned by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus in his Histories. Darius I introduced the Aramaic writing system and coin currency to Central Asia, in addition to incorporating Sogdians into his standing army as regular soldiers and cavalrymen. A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his ultimately failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC. A Persian inscription from Susa claims that the palace there was adorned with lapis lazuli and carnelian originating from Sogdiana. Given the absence of any named satraps i.e. Achaemenid provincial governors for Sogdiana in historical records, modern scholarship has concluded that Sogdiana was governed from the satrapy of nearby Bactria. The satraps were often relatives of the ruling Persian kings, especially sons who were not designated as the heir apparent. Sogdiana likely remained under Persian control until roughly 400 BC, during the reign of Artaxerxes II. Rebellious states of the Persian Empire took advantage of the weak Artaxerxes II, and some, such as Egypt, were able to regain their independence. Persia's massive loss of Central Asian territory is widely attributed to the ruler's lack of control. However, unlike Egypt, which was quickly recaptured by the Persian Empire, Sogdiana remained independent until it was conquered by Alexander the Great. When the latter invaded the Persian Empire, Pharasmanes, an already independent king of Khwarezm, allied with the Macedonians and sent troops to Alexander in 329 BC for his war against the Scythians of the Black Sea region even though this anticipated campaign never materialized . During the Achaemenid period 550330 BC , the Sogdians lived as a nomadic people much like the neighboring Yuezhi, who spoke Bactrian, an Indo Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, and were already engaging in overland trade. Some of them had also gradually settled the land to engage in agriculture. Similar to how the Yuezhi offered tributary gifts of jade to the emperors of China, the Sogdians are recorded in Persian records as submitting precious gifts of lapis lazuli and carnelian to Darius I, the Persian king of kings. Although the Sogdians were at times independent and living outside the boundaries of large empires, they never formed a great empire of their own like the Yuezhi, who established the Kushan Empire 30375 AD of Central and South Asia. A now independent and warlike Sogdiana, led at first by Bessus, the Achaemenid satrap of Bactria and claimant to the throne after assassinating Darius III in his flight from the Macedonian Greek army, formed a border region insulating the Achaemenid Persians from the nomadic Scythians to the north and east. The Sogdian Rock or Rock of Ariamazes, a fortress in Sogdiana, was captured in 327 BC by the forces of Alexander the Great, the basileus of Macedonian Greece and conqueror of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Oxyartes, a Sogdian nobleman of Bactria, had hoped to keep his daughter Roxana safe at the fortress of the Sogdian Rock, yet after its fall Roxana was soon wed to Alexander as one of his several wives. Roxana, a Sogdian whose name Roshanak means little star , was the mother of Alexander IV of Macedon, who inherited his late father's throne in 323 BC although the empire was soon divided in the Wars of the Diadochi . After an extended campaign putting down Sogdian resistance and founding military outposts manned by his Macedonian veterans, Alexander united Sogdiana with Bactria into one satrapy. The Sogdian nobleman and warlord Spitamenes 370328 BC , allied with Scythian tribes, led an uprising against Alexander's forces. This revolt was put down by Alexander and his generals Amyntas, Craterus, and Coenus, with the aid of native Bactrian and Sogdian troops. With the Scythian and Sogdian rebels defeated, Spitamenes was allegedly betrayed by his own wife and beheaded. Pursuant with his own marriage to Roxana, Alexander encouraged his men to marry Sogdian women in order to discourage further revolt. This included Apama, daughter of the rebel Spitamenes, who wed Seleucus I Nicator and bore him a son and future heir to the Seleucid throne. According to the Roman historian Appian, Seleucus I named three new Hellenistic cities in Asia after her see Apamea . The military power of the Sogdians never recovered. Subsequently, Sogdiana formed part of the Hellenistic Greco Bactrian Kingdom, a breakaway state from the Seleucid Empire founded in 248 BC by Diodotus I, for roughly a century. Euthydemus I, a former satrap of Sogdiana, seems to have held the Sogdian territory as a rival claimant to the Greco Bactrian throne his coins were later copied locally and bore Aramaic inscriptions. The Greco Bactrian king Eucratides I may have recovered sovereignty of Sogdia temporarily. Finally the area was occupied by nomads when the Scythians and Yuezhis overran it around 145 BC. From then until about 40 BC the Yuezhi tepidly minted coins imitating and still bearing the images of the Greco Bactrian kings Eucratides I and Heliocles I, yet soon afterwards they began minting unique coins bearing the faces of their own rulers as a prelude to asserting themselves as a world power under the Kushan Empire. The American historian Homer H. Dubs offered the suggestion that a lost legion from the Roman army of Crassus that fought at Carrhae encountered and even fought a Chinese army of the Han Dynasty in the region ... Han expedition into central Asia, west of the Jaxartes River, apparently encountered and defeated a contingent of Roman legionaries. The Romans may have been the enslaved remnants of Crassus' army, defeated by the Parthians and forced to fight on their eastern frontier. Sogdiana modern Bukhara , east of the Oxus River, on the Polytimetus River, was apparently the most easterly penetration ever made by Roman forces in Asia. The margin of Chinese victory appears to have been their crossbows, whose bolts and darts seem easily to have penetrated Roman shields and armour. However, this interpretation has been disputed by scholars such as Schuyler V. Cammann. Most merchants did not travel the entire Silk Road but would trade goods through middlemen based in oasis towns such as Khotan or Dunhuang. The Sogdians, however, established a trading network across the 1500 miles from Sogdiana to China. In fact, the Sogdians turned their energies to trade so thoroughly that the Saka of the Kingdom of Khotan called all merchants suli, Sogdian , whatever their culture or ethnicity. Unlike the empires of antiquity, the Sogdian region was not a territory confined within fixed borders, but rather a network of city states, from one oasis to another, linking Sogdiana to Byzantium, India, Indochina and China. Sogdian contacts with China were initiated by the embassy of the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Emperor Wu r. 14187 BC of the former Han dynasty. Zhang wrote a report of his visit to the Western Regions in Central Asia and named the area of Sogdiana as Kangju . Following Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial Chinese relations with Central Asia and Sogdiana flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC. In his Shiji published in 94 BC, Chinese historian Sima Qian remarked that the largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members ... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out. In terms of the silk trade, the Sogdians also served as the primary middlemen between the Chinese Han Empire and the Parthian Empire of the Middle East and West Asia. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade between China and Central Asia along the Silk Roads as late as the 10th century, their language serving as a lingua franca for Asian trade as far back as the 4th century. Subsequent to their domination by Alexander the Great, the Sogdians from the city of Marakanda Samarkand became dominant as traveling merchants, occupying a key position along the ancient Silk Road. They played an active role in the spread of faiths such as Manicheism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism along the Silk Road. The Chinese Sui Shu Book of Sui describes Sogdians as skilled merchants who attracted many foreign traders to their land to engage in commerce. They were described by the Chinese as born merchants, learning their commercial skills at an early age. It appears from sources, such as documents found by Sir Aurel Stein and others, that by the 4th century they may have monopolized trade between India and China. A letter written by Sogdian merchants dated 313 AD and found in the ruins of a watchtower in Gansu was intended to be sent to merchants in Samarkand, warning them that after Liu Cong of Han Zhao sacked Luoyang and the Jin emperor fled the capital, there was no worthwhile business there for Indian and Sogdian merchants. Furthermore, in 568 AD a Turko Sogdian delegation travelled to the Roman emperor in Constantinople to obtain permission to trade and in the following years commercial activity between the states flourished. Put simply, the Sogdians dominated trade along the Silk Road from the 2nd century BC until the 10th century. Suyab and Talas in modern day Kyrgyzstan were the main Sogdian centers in the north that dominated the caravan routes of the 6th to 8th centuries. Their commercial interests were protected by the resurgent military power of the Gokturks, whose empire was built on the political power of the Ashina clan and economic clout of the Sogdians. Sogdian trade, with some interruptions, continued into the 9th century. For instance, camels, women, girls, silver, and gold were seized from Sogdia during a raid by Qapaghan Qaghan 692716 , ruler of the Second Turkic Khaganate. In the 10th century Sogdiana was incorporated into the Uighur Empire, which until 840 encompassed northern Central Asia. This khaganate obtained enormous deliveries of silk from Tang China in exchange for horses, in turn relying on the Sogdians to sell much of this silk further west. Peter B. Golden writes that the Uyghurs not only adopted the writing system and religious faiths of the Sogdians, such as Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Christianity, but also looked to the Sogdians as mentors while gradually replacing them in their roles as Silk Road traders and purveyors of culture. Muslim geographers of the 10th century drew upon Sogdian records dating to 750840. After the end of the Uyghur Empire, Sogdian trade underwent a crisis. Following the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana in the 8th century, the Samanids resumed trade on the northwestern road leading to the Khazars and the Urals and the northeastern one toward the nearby Turkic tribes. During the 5th and 6th century many Sogdians took up residence in the Hexi Corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao, which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty nine out of the thirty five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and the seller were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, alfalfa, and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught to read and write at the age of five, though their skill was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers. Historical knowledge about Sogdia is somewhat hazy during the period of the Parthian Empire 247 BC 224 AD in Persia. The subsequent Sasanian Empire of Persia conquered and incorporated Sogdia as a satrapy in 260, an inscription dating to the reign of Shapur I noting that its limits formed the northeastern Sasanian borderlands with the Kushan Empire. However, by the 5th century the region was captured by the rival Hephthalite Empire. Shortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istami, the Gokturk ruler of the Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines. Istami refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istami to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians. It appears, however, that direct trade with the Sogdians remained limited in light of the small amount of Roman and Byzantine coins found in Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era. Although Roman embassies apparently reached Han China from 166 AD onwards, and the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han dynasty Chinese imported Roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen 2012 wrote that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic 50727 BC or the Principate 27 BC 330 AD era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. However, Warwick Ball 2016 upends this notion by pointing to a hoard of sixteen Roman coins found at Xi'an, China formerly Chang'an , dated to the reigns of various emperors from Tiberius 1437 AD to Aurelian 270275 AD . The earliest gold solidus coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II r. 408450 and altogether only forty eight of them have been found compared to thirteen hundred silver coins in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage over the course of the 7th century. The fact that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans confirms the pre eminent importance of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome. Aside from the Sogdians of Central Asia who acted as middlemen in the Silk Road trade, other Sogdians settled down in China for generations. Although many Sogdians had fled Luoyang following the collapse of the Jin Dynasty's control over northern China in 311 AD, some Sogdians continued living in Gansu. Sogdian families living in Gansu created funerary epitaphs explaining the history of their illustrious houses. For instance, a sabao , from Sanskrit sarthavaha, meaning caravan leader from Anxi western Sogdiana or Parthia who lived in Jiuquan during the Northern Wei 386 535 AD , was the ancestor of An Tugen, a man who rose from a common merchant to become a top ranking minister of state for the Northern Qi 550 577 AD . Valerie Hansen asserts that around this time and extending into the Tang Dynasty 618 907 AD , the Sogdians became the most influential of the non Chinese groups resident in China, settling throughout Chinese territory, marrying Chinese women, purchasing land, with newcomers living there permanently instead of returning to their homelands in Sogdiana. They were concentrated in large numbers around Luoyang and Chang'an, and also Xiangyang in present day Hubei, building Zoroastrian temples to service their communities once they reached the threshold of roughly 100 households. From the Northern Qi to Tang periods, the leaders of these communities, the sabao, were incorporated into the official hierarchy of state officials. Their burial practices blended both Chinese forms such as carved funerary beds with Zoroastrian sensibilities in mind, such as separating the body from both the earth and water. In addition to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose to the position of a military governor jiedushi in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion 755 763 AD , which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath many of them were slain or changed their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that little is known about the Sogdian presence in North China since that time. Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li. During the Tang and subsequent Five Dynasties and Song Dynasty, a large community of Sogdians also existed in the multicultural entrepot of Dunhuang, Gansu, a major center of Buddhist learning and home to the Buddhist Mogao Caves. Although Dunhuang and the Hexi Corridor were captured by the Tibetan Empire after the An Lushan Rebellion, in 848 the ethnic Han Chinese general Zhang Yichao 799872 managed to wrestle control of the region from the Tibetans during their civil war, establishing the Guiyi Circuit under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang r. 846859 . Although the region occasionally fell under the rule of different states, it retained its multilingual nature as evidenced by an abundance of manuscripts religious and secular in Chinese and Tibetan, but also Sogdian, Khotanese another Eastern Iranian language native to the region , Uyghur, and Sanskrit. From the Chinese surnames listed in the Tang era Dunhuang manuscript Pelliot chinois 3319V containing the following text , the names of the Nine Zhaowu Clans , the prominent ethnic Sogdian families of China, have been deduced. Of these the most common Sogdian surname throughout China was Shi , generally given to those from Chach, modern Tashkent , whereas the surnames Shi , from Kesh, modern Shahrisabz , An , from Bukhara , Mi , from Panjakent , Kang , from Samarkand , Cao , from Kabudhan, north of the Zeravshan River , and He , from Kushaniyah appear frequently in Dunhuang manuscripts and registers. The influence of Sinicized and multilingual Sogdians during this Guiyijun period c. 850 c. 1000 AD of Dunhuang is evident in a large number of manuscripts written in Chinese characters from left to right instead of vertically, mirroring the direction of how the Sogdian alphabet is read. Sogdians of Dunhuang also commonly formed and joined lay associations among their local communities, convening at Sogdian owned taverns in scheduled meetings mentioned in their epistolary letters. Sogdians living in Turfan under the Tang dynasty and Gaochang Kingdom engaged in a variety of occupations that included farming, military service, painting, leather crafting and selling products such as iron goods. The Sogdians had been migrating to Turfan since the 4th century, yet the pace of migration began to climb steadily with the Muslim conquest of Persia and Fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, followed by the Islamic conquest of Samarkand in 712. Qutayba ibn Muslim 669716 , Governor of Greater Khorasan under the Umayyad Caliphate 661750 , initiated the Muslim conquest of Sogdia during the early 8th century, with the local ruler of Balkh offering him aid as an Umayyad ally. However, when his successor Al Jarrah ibn Abdallah governed Khorosan 717719 , many native Sogdians, who had converted to Islam, began to revolt when they were no longer exempt from paying the tax on non Muslims, the jizya, because of a new law stating that proof of circumcision and literacy in the Quran was necessary for new converts. With the aid of Turkic peoples, the Sogdians were able to expel the Umayyad Arab garrison from Samarkand and Umayyad attempts to restore power there were rebuffed until the arrival of Sa'id ibn Amr al Harashi fl. 720735 . The Sogdian ruler i.e. ikhshid of Samarkand, Gurak, who had previously overthrown the pro Umayyad Sogdian ruler Tarkhun in 710, decided that resistance against al Harashi's large Arab force was pointless and thereafter persuaded his followers to declare allegiance to the Umayyad governor. Divashtich r. 706722 , the Sogdian ruler of Panjakent, led his forces to the Zarafshan Range near modern Zarafshan, Tajikistan , whereas the Sogdians following Karzanj, the ruler of Pai modern Kattakurgan, Uzbekistan , fled to the Principality of Farghana, where their ruler at Tar or Alutar promised them safety and refuge from the Umayyads. However, at Tar secretly informed al Harashi of the Sogdians hiding in Khujand, who were then slaughtered by al Harashi's forces after their arrival. The Umayyads fell in 750 to the Abbasid Caliphate, which quickly asserted itself in Central Asia after winning the Battle of Talas along the Talas River in modern Talas Oblast, Kyrgyzstan in 751 against the Chinese Tang Dynasty. This conflict incidentally introduced Chinese papermaking to the Islamic world. The cultural consequences and political ramifications of this battle meant the retreat of the Chinese empire from Central Asia. It also allowed for the rise of the Samanid Empire 819999 , a Persian state centered at Bukhara in what is now modern Uzbekistan that nominally observed the Abbasids as their overlords, yet retained a great deal of autonomy and upheld the mercantile legacy of the Sogdians. Yet the Sogdian language gradually declined in favor of the Persian language of the Samanids the ancestor to the modern Tajik language , the spoken language of renowned poets and intellectuals of the age such as Ferdowsi 9401020 . So too did the original religions of the Sogdians decline Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Nestorian Christianity disappeared in the region by the end of the Samanid period. The Samanids were also responsible for converting the surrounding Turkic peoples to Islam, which presaged the conquest of their empire in 999 by an Islamic Turkic power, the Kara Khanid Khanate 8401212 . During the early 13th century Khwarezmia was invaded by the early Mongol Empire and its ruler Genghis Khan destroyed the once vibrant cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. However, in 1370 Samarkand saw a revival as the capital of the Timurid Empire. The Turko Mongol ruler Timur forcefully brought artisans and intellectuals from across Asia to Samarkand, transforming it not only into a trade hub but also one of the most important cities of the Islamic world. The 6th century is thought to be the peak of Sogdian culture, judging by its highly developed artistic tradition. By this point, the Sogdians were entrenched in their role as the central Asian traveling and trading merchants, transferring goods, culture and religion. During the Middle Ages, the valley of the Zarafshan around Samarkand retained its Sogdian name, Samarkand. According to the Encyclopdia Britannica, medieval Arab geographers considered it one of the four fairest regions of the world. Where the Sogdians moved in considerable numbers, their language made a considerable impact. For instance, during China's Han dynasty, the native name of the Tarim Basin city state of Loulan was Kroraina, possibly from Greek due to nearby Hellenistic influence. However, centuries later in 664 AD the Tang Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang labelled it as Nafupo , which according to Dr. Hisao Matsuda is a transliteration of the Sogdian word Navapa meaning new water. The Afrasiab paintings of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and events such as the arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, Tajikistan. In addition to revealing aspects of their social and political lives, Sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians' understanding of their religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Iranian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non Buddhist image similarly found in the paintings of Samarkand and Panjakent. The Sogdians spoke an Eastern Iranian language called Sogdian, closely related to Bactrian, Khwarazmian, and the Khotanese language Saka, widely spoken Eastern Iranian languages of Central Asia in ancient times. Sogdian was also prominent in the oasis city state of Turfan in the Tarim Basin region of Northwest China in modern Xinjiang . Judging by the Sogdian Bugut inscription of Mongolia written c. 581, the Sogdian language was also an official language of the Turkic Khaganate established by the Gokturks. Sogdian was written largely in three scripts the Sogdian alphabet, the Syriac alphabet, and the Manichaean alphabet, each derived from the Aramaic alphabet, which had been widely used in both the Achaemenid and Parthian empires of ancient Iran. The Sogdian alphabet formed the basis of the Old Uyghur alphabet of the 8th century, which in turn was used to create the Mongolian script of the early Mongol Empire during the 13th century. The Yaghnobi people living in the Sughd province of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates can be found in the modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language. Early medieval Sogdian costumes can be divided in two periods Hephtalitic 5th and 6th centuries and Turkic 7th and early 8th centuries . The latter did not become common immediately after the political dominance of the Gokturks but only in c. 620 when, especially following Western Turkic Khagan Ton jazbgu's reforms, Sogd was Turkized and the local nobility was officially included in the Khaganate's administration. For both sexes clothes were tight fitted, and narrow waists and wrists were appreciated. The silhouettes for grown men and young girls emphasized wide shoulders and narrowed to the waist the silhouettes for female aristocrats were more complicated. The Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization in the ensuing centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and sleeved coats became more common. The Sogdians practiced a variety of religious faiths. However, Zoroastrianism was most likely their main religion as demonstrated by material evidence. For instance, the discovery of murals depicting votaries making offers before fire holders and ossuaries from Samarkand, Panjakent and Er Kurgan held the bones of the dead in accordance with Zoroastrian ritual. At Turfan, Sogdian burials shared similar features with traditional Chinese practices, yet they still retained essential Zoroastrian rituals, such as allowing the bodies to be picked clean by scavengers before burying the bones in ossuaries. They also sacrificed animals to Zoroastrian deities, including the supreme deity Ahura Mazda. Zoroastrianism remained the dominant religion among Sogdians until after the Islamic conquest, when they gradually converted to Islam, as is shown by Richard Bulliet's conversion curve . The Sogdian religious texts found in China and dating to the Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang are mostly Buddhist translated from Chinese sources , Manichaean and Nestorian Christian, with only a small minority of Zoroastrian texts. But tombs of Sogdian merchants in China dated to the last third of the 6th century show predominantly Zoroastrian motifs or Zoroastrian Manichaean syncretism, while archaeological remains from Sogdiana appear fairly Iranian and conservatively Zoroastrian. However, the Sogdians epitomized the religious plurality found along the trade routes. The largest body of Sogdian texts are Buddhist, and Sogdians were among the principal translators of Buddhist sutras into Chinese. However, Buddhism did not take root in Sogdiana itself. Additionally, the Bulayiq monastery to the north of Turpan contained Sogdian Christian texts and there are numerous Manichaean texts in Sogdiana from nearby Qocho. The reconversion of Sogdians from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism coincided with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Sassanid Empire of Persia. From the 4th century onwards, Sogdian Buddhist pilgrims left behind evidence of their travels along the steep cliffs of the Indus River and Hunza Valley. It was here that they carved images of the Buddha and holy stupas in addition to their full names, in hopes that the Buddha would grant them his protection. The Sogdians also practiced the faith of Mani, Manichaeism, a faith that they spread to the Uyghurs. The Uyghur Khaganate 744840 AD developed close ties to Tang China once they aided the Tang in suppressing the rebellion of An Lushan and his Gokturk successor Shi Siming, establishing an annual trade relationship of one million bolts of Chinese silk for one hundred thousand horses. The Uyghurs relied on Sogdian merchants to sell much of this silk further west along the Silk Road, a symbiotic relationship that led many Uyghurs to adopt Manichaeism from the Sogdians. However, evidence of Manichaean liturgical and canonical texts of Sogdian origin remains fragmentary and sparse compared to their corpus of Buddhist writings. The Uyghurs were also followers of Buddhism. For instance, they can be seen wearing silk robes in the pranidhi scenes of the Uyghur Bezeklik Buddhist murals of Xinjiang, China, particularly Scene 6 from Temple 9 showing Sogdian donors to the Buddha. In addition to Puranic cults, there were five Hindu deities known to have been worshipped in Sogdiana. These were Brahma, Indra, Mahadeva Shiva , Narayana, and Vaishravana the gods Brahma, Indra, and Shiva were known by their Sogdian names Zravan, Adbad and Veshparkar, respectively. Durga, a mother goddess in Shaktism, may be represented in Sogdian art as a four armed goddess riding atop a lion. As seen in an 8th century mural from Panjakent, portable fire altars can be associated with Mahadeva Veshparkar, Brahma Zravan, and Indra Abdab, according to Braja Bihari Kumar. Among the Sogdian Christians known in China from inscriptions and texts were An Yena, a Christian from An country Bukhara . Mi Jifen a Christian from Mi country Maymurgh , Kang Zhitong, a Sogdian Christian cleric from Kang country Samarkand , Mi Xuanqing a Sogdian Christian cleric from Mi country Maymurgh , Mi Xuanying, a Sogdian Christian cleric from Mi country Maymurgh , An Qingsu, a Sogdian Christian monk from An country Bukhara . When visiting Yuan era Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China during the late 13th century, the Venetian explorer and merchant Marco Polo noted that a large number of Christian churches had been built there. His claim is confirmed by a Chinese text of the 14th century explaining how a Sogdian named Mar Sargis from Samarkand founded six Nestorian Christian churches there in addition to one in Hangzhou during the second half of the 13th century. Nestorian Christianity had existed in China earlier during the Tang Dynasty when a Persian monk named Alopen came to Chang'an in 653 to proselytize, as described in a dual Chinese and Syriac language inscription from Chang'an modern Xi'an dated to the year 781. Within the Syriac inscription is a list of priests and monks, one of whom is named Gabriel, the archdeacon of Xumdan and Sarag , the Sogdian names for the Chinese capital cities Chang'an and Luoyang, respectively. In regards to textual material, the earliest Christian gospel texts translated into Sogdian coincide with the reign of the Sasanian Persian monarch Yazdegerd II r. 438457 and were translated from the Peshitta, the standard version of the Bible in Syriac Christianity. Slavery existed in China since ancient times, although during the Han dynasty the proportion of slaves to the overall population was roughly 1 , far lower than the estimate for the contemporary Greco Roman world estimated at about 15 of the entire population . During the Tang period slaves were not allowed to marry a commoner's daughter, were not allowed to have sexual relations with any female member of their master's family, and although fornication with female slaves was forbidden in the Tang code of law it was widely practiced. Manumission was also permitted when a slave woman gave birth to her master's son, which allowed for her elevation to the legal status of a commoner, yet she could only live as a concubine and not as the wife of her former master. Sogdian and Chinese merchants regularly traded in slaves in and around Turpan during the Tang dynasty. Turpan under Tang dynasty rule was a center of major commercial activity between Chinese and Sogdian merchants. There were many inns in Turpan. Some provided Sogdian sex workers with an opportunity to service the Silk Road merchants, since the official histories report that there were markets in women at Kucha and Khotan. The Sogdian language contract buried at the Astana graveyard demonstrates that at least one Chinese man bought a Sogdian girl in 639 AD. One of the archaeologists who excavated the Astana site, Wu Zhen, contends that, although many households along the Silk Road bought individual slaves, as we can see in the earlier documents from Niya, the Turpan documents point to a massive escalation in the volume of the slave trade. In 639 a female Sogdian slave was sold to a Chinese man as recorded in an Astana cemetery legal document written in Sogdian. Khotan and Kucha were places where women were commonly sold, with ample evidence of the slave trade in Turfan thanks to contemporary textual sources that have survived. In Tang poetry Sogdian girls also frequently appear as serving maids in the taverns and inns of the capital Chang'an. Sogdian slave girls and their Chinese male owners made up the majority of Sogdian female Chinese male pairings, while free Sogdian women were the most common spouse of Sogdian men. A smaller number of Chinese women were paired with elite Sogdian men. Sogdian man and woman pairings made up eighteen out of twenty one marriages according to existing documents. A document dated 731 AD reveals that precisely forty bolts of silk were paid to a certain Mi Lushan, a slave dealing Sogdian, by a Chinese man named Tang Rong of Chang'an, for the purchase of an eleven year old girl. A person from Xizhou, a Tokharistani i.e. Bactrian , and three Sogdians verified the sale of the girl. In 1916 the French Sinologist and historian Paul Pelliot used Tang Chinese manuscripts excavated from Dunhuang, Gansu to identify an ancient Sogdian colony south of Lop Nur in Xinjiang Northwest China , which he argued was the base for the spread of Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity in China. In 1926 Japanese scholar Kuwabara compiled evidence for Sogdians in Chinese historical sources and by 1933 Chinese historian Xiang Da published his Tang Chang'an and Central Asian Culture detailing the Sogdian influence on Chinese social religious life in the Tang era Chinese capital city. The Canadian Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank published an article in 1952 demonstrating the presence of a Sogdian colony founded in Six Hu Prefectures of the Ordos Loop during the Chinese Tang period, composed of Sogdians and Turkic peoples who migrated from the Mongolian steppe. The Japanese historian Ikeda On wrote an article in 1965 outlining the history of the Sogdians inhabiting Dunhuang from the beginning of the 7th century, analyzing lists of their Sinicized names and the role of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism in their religious life. Yoshida Yutaka and Kageyama Etsuko, Japanese ethnographers and linguists of the Sogdian language, were able to reconstruct Sogdian names from forty five different Chinese transliterations, noting that these were common in Turfan whereas Sogdians living closer to the center of Chinese civilization for generations adopted traditional Chinese names.

"Soggade Chinni Nayana English The Young Man is a Charmer is a 2016 Indian Telugu language supernatural drama film directed by Kalyan Krishna Kurasala. In addition to producing the film under his Annapurna Studios banner, Akkineni Nagarjuna played dual roles. Ramya Krishna and Lavanya Tripathi were the film's female leads. Nassar, Pithamagan Mahadevan, Sampath Raj and Brahmanandam played key supporting roles. Written by Ram Mohan P, Soggade Chinni Nayana revolves around the soul of Bangarraju, a flirtatious zamindar whom Yama the god of the underworld sends back to earth to reconcile his son Ram Ramu Mohan and his wife Seetha they are on the brink of divorce. In the process, he learns about his death and its connection with a local Shiva temple. P. S. Vinod and Siddhardh Ramaswami provided the cinematography, and Anup Rubens composed the film's soundtrack and background score. Prawin Pudi edited the film. Principal photography for the film began on 19 November 2014 after it was launched in Hyderabad, and wrapped on 4 October 2015. Most of the film was shot in and around Rajahmundry and Mysore. Produced on a budget of 150200 million, Soggade Chinni Nayana was released worldwide on 15 January 2016 during the Makar Sankranti festival season in 800 900 screens. It received positive reviews from critics and was commercially successful, earning 750 million globally. The film was remade in Kannada as Upendra Matte Baa 2017 , starring Upendra, Prema and Sruthi Hariharan in the lead roles. Ram Ramu Mohan is a socially inept cardiologist practicing in the United States. His wife, Seetha, feels lonely since Ramu pays very little attention to her because of his work. They decide to divorce and leave for Sivapuram, Rajahmundry, where Ramu's mother Satyabhama lives. Satyabhama, shocked to learn that Ramu and Seetha are divorcing, shouts at a portrait of her deceased husband Bangarraju a benevolent, flirtatious zamindar who died nearly 30 years ago in an accident . Bangarraju's soul is in Naraka, where he continues to flirt. Yama, at Shiva's command, sends him back to earth because there is a mission only he can fulfil. Bangarraju, who can be seen and heard only by Satyabhama, tries to solve his family's problems. After several unsuccessful attempts, Bangarraju possesses Ramu's body on his birthday. He meets Ramu's young female cousins, and invites them to his home. On his way back Ramu meets Suri, a frightened drunk who runs away as Ramu and Bangarraju look identical. To free himself from guilt, Suri later admits that he murdered Bangarraju with a lorry after he was bribed. Before he can disclose more details, Suri dies in an accident and Bangarraju learns that his family is in danger. Ramu spends quality time with his cousins, making Seetha jealous. Bangarraju is confronted by Satyabhama, who is unaware of recent events. He suggests that she help Seetha impress Ramu. At Satyabhama's suggestion, Ramu and Seetha go to a theatre to watch a film. When she is taunted, Ramu possessed by Bangarraju overpowers her tormenters. Seetha is pleasantly surprised, since Ramu failed to confront the same group earlier in a similar situation. The couple slowly grow closer, and Seetha realises that Ramu does love her. Bangarraju learns from Athmanandam, a godman who can communicate with souls, that his uncle Rudraraju masterminded his murder. Rudraraju and his cousin, Veerababu, wanted to steal jewellery from a 1,000 year old temple to Shiva. They murdered Bangarraju, bribing Suri to silence him. After Rudraraju's son dies when he is bitten by a divine snake, a tantrik warns that only Bangarraju's descendants can open the lock others would be killed by the snake. The tantrik captures Bangarraju's soul and gives a few threads to Sampath, Rudraraju's grandson, telling him to tie them to the hands of every member of Bangarraju's family to keep his soul from communicating with them. After Sampath and the others leave, the snake kills the tantrik and saves Bangarraju's soul. Bangarraju reaches the temple, where Satyabhama can neither see nor hear him and he cannot possess Ramu. Rudraraju and Sampath attack Ramu and Seetha after the jewellery is removed from the treasury. Rudraraju tells his henchmen to put the couple in a car with the jewellery, which will make the villagers think that they are the thieves. The thread to Ramu's hand comes loose, and Bangarraju possesses him. Bangarraju fights them and retrieves the jewellery before leaving Ramu, who operates on an injured Seetha in a nearby hospital. Satyabhama removes the thread and can see Bangarraju. Ramu and Seetha reconcile, and Yama orders Bangarraju to come back in accordance with Shiva's instructions. When Satyabhama begs Bangarraju to stay, Yama gives him a chance to wipe away her tears. He asks her to keep smiling and live happily for his sake, and returns to Naraka. During the production of Manam 2014 , producer and lead actor Akkineni Nagarjuna liked the portions which were set against a village backdrop. He developed an interest in making a film based on Indian village life, feeling that audiences would see a new, yet traditional lifestyle, something fresh and interesting . After sketching the basic idea, Ram Mohan P approached Virinchi Varma to direct the film Mohan produced Varma's directorial debut, Uyyala Jampala 2013 . Varma declined the offer, since he wanted to film his own script. Nagarjuna then gave the synopsis to Kalyan Krishna Kurasala, who completed the script within a month. Kurasala was confirmed as director, marking his directorial debut in Telugu cinema. Nagarjuna approved the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as the ghost of Bangarraju and the divine snake guarding his family, on the condition that they be positive and not frightening. He played two roles Bangarraju, a flirtatious zamindar, and his son Ramu a socially inept doctor, born the day after Bangarraju's death . Ramu's character was based on Umakanth, a contestant on Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu a game show hosted by Nagarjuna . As Bangarraju, Nagarjuna wore a dhoti and a 1959 watch both were worn by his father, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, in his many village film starring roles. Ramya Krishnan and Lavanya Tripathi were the female leads Pranitha Subhash and Sonal Chauhan were considered before Tripathi was cast. Initially skeptical about playing a married woman, Tripathi agreed after listening to a script reading at the Annapurna Studios office. In a January 2016 interview with The Hindu, Nagarjuna mentioned that Bangarraju and Satyabhama played by Ramya would be a hot, romantic couple, in contrast to the innocent, cute Ramu and Seetha played by Tripathi . After being cast, Tripathi said that her character, a traditional Indian girl, would have a romantic touch. L. Satyanand wrote Soggade Chinni Nayana's screenplay, and Anup Rubens composed its soundtrack and score. P. S. Vinod and Siddhardh Ramaswami were the cinematographers. Prawin Pudi and Ravinder Reddy were in charge of the film's editing and art direction respectively. A launch ceremony was held on 19 November 2014 at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad, and principal photography began several hours later on a set erected in the Studios' premises. Anushka Shetty made a cameo appearance in the film. Hamsa Nandini confirmed her inclusion in the cast in December 2014 she played a supporting role and participated in a song with Nagarjuna. Raju Sundaram, Vishwa and Raghu choreographed the songs. Television presenter Anasuya Bharadwaj played Nagarjuna's cousin after Swati Reddy backed out, citing scheduling conflicts. Diksha Panth also made a cameo appearance her inclusion was confirmed in August 2015. Nagarjuna had to simultaneously complete his portions of Oopiri 2016 and Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu during 2015. Filming resumed on 11 February 2015 after completion of two schedules. Principal photography continued in Mysore on 10 March 2015 after key sequences were filmed in and around Rajahmundry. Several scenes were filmed at a 1,500 year old Vishnu temple in Mysore. In September 2015, with Soggade Chinni Nayana nearing completion, its film unit told Indo Asian News Service that a few key scenes would be re filmed on the advice of writer Sai Madhav Burra who changed some scenes to suit the story . The re filming delayed its release. Principal photography wrapped on 4 October 2015 in Mysore, and post production began shortly afterwards. Soggade Chinni Nayana was produced on a budget of 150200 million. Soggade Chinni Nayana was released worldwide on 15 January 2016 in 800 900 screens. Three other Telugu films Nannaku Prematho, Express Raja and Dictator were released at the same time, which affected its distribution. Nagarjuna defended his release decision, saying that the film's rural backdrop made it suitable for the Makar Sankranti season a harvest festival . He added, I announced the date two and a half months ago and blocked the theatres. Theres nothing I can do now ... Global Cinema acquired the film's theatrical rights for the Nizam region. The film received positive reviews from critics. Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave Soggade Chinni Nayana four out of five stars, praising Kurasala's narrative clarity and calling it wonderful overall for its consistent tempo. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo, in The Hindu, gave the film 3.5 stars out of five and said it was set in a familiar, comfort zone which guarantees a lot of fun . Dundoo found the temple and snake subplot engaging. Pranita Jonnalagedda of The Times of India also gave the film 3.5 stars out of five, calling it so uncomplicated, unfussy and unpretentious that viewers get hooked to its simplicity . Sify gave Soggade Chinni Nayana three stars out of five, comparing the film to Nageswara Rao's 1978 film Sri Rama Raksha. The reviewer praised Nagarjuna's performance and Kurasala's narrative clarity. L. Ravichander of The Hans India gave it a negative review, calling it an obsolete film with crass humor. Ravichander called Ramya's performance the lone bright spot ... all grace, charm and vigour.

Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from The Hindu wrote that Rubens' music complemented the film's rural backdrop. Sify called Rubens' music one of the film's biggest strengths, which perfectly gelled with the rustic storyline .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soggade%20Chinni%20Nayana
"The Sognsvann Line Norwegian Sognsvannsbanen is a rapid transit line on the Oslo Metro of Norway. It branches from the Common Tunnel at Majorstuen and runs 6.0 kilometers 3.7 mi to Sognsvann. After Ulleval stadion, the Ring Line branches off. The Sognsvann Line serves the northwestern and northern neighborhoods of Oslo, mostly within the borough of Nordre Aker. The line is owned and maintained by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and has nine stations. The western end of line 5 serves the entire line. Line 4 and the eastern end of line 5 serve the southern part of the line up to Ulleval stadion before branching off and continuing along the Ring Line. This gives an average five minute headway on the southern part and an average fifteen minute headway on the northern part of the line. The line opened on 10 October 1934 as a light rail. In 1993, it was upgraded to metro standard as the first light rail west of Oslo, with two stations being closed. The Ring Line opened in 2003. Forskningsparken has transfer to the Oslo Tramway and serves Rikshospitalet. Forskningsparken and Blindern both serve the University of Oslo, while Ulleval stadion serves Norway's largest football venue. North of there the line mainly serves residential areas. Sognsvann serves the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the recreational area Nordmarka. The first plans for a light rail along the route of the Sognsvann Line were launched by Holmenkolbanen in 1904. They called for a branch from Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line to Geitmyren and onwards to Sagene. The next proposal for a line was launched in 1917, when Aker Municipality established the company Akersbanerne. It started work planning the stensj Line as well as the Sognsvann Line. The neighborhoods of Sogn and Tasen were being built, and the municipality wanted to establish a good transport system to make the areas more attractive. Holmenkolbanen stated that they should be prioritized to build the system, since they already had a line in the area, but the municipality wanted to have political control over the development of the area. In 1920, Holmenkolbanen applied to build a branch from Fren via Tasen to Nydalen and Grefsen, along what is today the Ring Line. This proposal included a branch to Sognsvann. The Ministry of Labour granted the concession to Akersbanerne, who started construction in January 1922. However, due to a labor conflict, the work was put on hold in 1924. In 1924, the Ra Line at the time called the Smestad Line was taken over by Akersbanerne, but Holmenkolbanen retained the operation. After the first part of the Common Tunnel, from Majorstuen to Nationaltheatret, opened in 1928, Holmenkolbanen was in financial distress, and in 1932 Akersbanerne took over the majority of the shares of Holmenkolbanen. At the same time, the Ra and Sognsvann Lines were merged into Holmenkolbanen. Work commenced again in 1933 and the line opened on 10 October 1934. At first the line was built with double track from Fren to sthorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was converted to double track. The construction spurred a massive residential construction along the line giving a good foundation for ridership. After the municipal merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, and two years later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13. During the 1980s, the city decided to connect the four suburban lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line was selected as the first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two car to fitting four car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations. Fren Station was rebuilt so only the trains on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while Nordberg Station was closed. All the stations, except Ulleval stadion, were built in the same architectural style. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed Ulleval stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football. The upgrade also included the installation of third rail from Majorstuen to Stortinget in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line. The new service became operated with T1000 rolling stock. Following the 1991 decision to build a new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ulleval Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve the northern part of the Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ulleval stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. In 1991, Oslo Sporveier presented plans to connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring as part of the tramway, and have combined operation with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. The city council voted in favor of building the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party. Financing was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The first section opened from Ulleval stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003. With the opening, Line 4 was extended from Ulleval stadion to Storo. On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass. In 2002, the Sognsvann Line was closed during the summer vacations due to improvements of the track and third rail. In 2008, the line was closed for approximately one week, due to leaves that had covered the tracks. The operation of the line was replaced by buses that served temporary stops in Nordbergveien and Sognsveien. In 2010, a truck was stuck under the train bridge between Holstein and Kringsja over Carl Kjeldsens vei. The bridge was damaged, and allowed for only one way traffic for two weeks. Half the trains had to stop at Berg in the meantime. The line branches off from the Common Tunnel after Majorstuen, and heads northwards through the borough of Nordre Aker. The first two stations, Blindern and Forskningsparken, serve the Blindern campus of the University of Oslo. At Forskningsparken, there is transfer to the Ulleval Hageby Line of the Oslo Tramway, which allows connection with the two largest hospitals in the country Rikshospitalet and Ulleval University Hospital. Ulleval stadion serves Norway's largest sports venue, Ulleval Stadion, the home ground of Norwegian Premier League side Valerenga and the national football team. North of Ulleval stadion, just before reaching Berg, the Ring Line with services 3 and 4 branches off. The Ring Line serves three stations, Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen before reaching the Grorud Line. From Berg to Tasen, the line runs parallel to the motorway Ring 3. North of Berg, the Sognsvann Line mainly serves residential areas, including student dormitories at Sogn and Kringsja. The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the National Archival Services of Norway is served by Sognsvann Station. The station also serves the recreational area Nordmarka and the lake Sognsvann. The Sognsvann Line is served by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. Half of line 5 trains operate the full length of the Sognsvann Line, while line 4 and the other half of the line 5 trains branch off after Ulleval stadion and serve the Ring Line. All services operate with a fifteen minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ulleval stadion an average five minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T banedrift on contract with Ruter. Transfer to the Kolsas, Ra and Holmenkollen Lines is possible at Majorstuen. Transfer to Oslo Central Station, which serves all mainline trains in Eastern Norway, is available at Jernbanetorget. Most west bound mainline trains can also be reached at Nationaltheatret. The Oslo Tramway can be reached from Majorstuen and Forskningsparken, as well as in the city center from Jernbanetorget, Stortinget and Nationaltheatret.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sognsvann%20Line
"Soho is an area of the City of Westminster, part of the West End of London. Originally a fashionable district for the aristocracy, it has been one of the main entertainment districts in the capital since the 19th century. The area was developed from farmland by Henry VIII in 1536, when it became a royal park. It became a parish in its own right in the late 17th century, when buildings started to be developed for the upper class, including the laying out of Soho Square in the 1680s. St Anne's Church was established during the late 17th century, and remains a significant local landmark other churches are the Church of our Lady of the Assumption and Saint Gregory and St Patrick's Church in Soho Square. The aristocracy had mostly moved away by the mid 19th century, when Soho was particularly badly hit by an outbreak of cholera in 1854. For much of the 20th century Soho had a reputation as a base for the sex industry in addition to its night life and its location for the headquarters of leading film companies. Since the 1980s, the area has undergone considerable gentrification. It is now predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices, with only a small remnant of sex industry venues. London's gay community is centred on Old Compton Street in Soho. Soho's reputation as a major entertainment district of London stems from theatres such as the Windmill Theatre on Great Windmill Street and the Raymond Revuebar owned by entrepreneur Paul Raymond, and music clubs such as the 2i's Coffee Bar and the Marquee Club. Trident Studios was based in Soho, and the nearby Denmark Street has hosted numerous music publishing houses and instrument shops from the 20th century onwards. The independent British film industry is centred around Soho, including the British headquarters of Twentieth Century Fox and the British Board of Film Classification offices. The area has been popular for restaurants since the 19th century, including the long standing Kettner's which was visited by numerous celebrities. Near to Soho is London's Chinatown, centred on Gerrard Street and containing several restaurants. The name Soho first appears in the 17th century. The name may possibly derive from a former hunting cry. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, used soho as a rallying call for his men at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, half a century after the name was first used for this area of London. The Soho name has been reused by other entertainment and restaurant districts such as the Soho, Hong Kong entertainment zone and the cultural and commercial area of Soho in Malaga. The New York City neighborhood of SoHo, Manhattan, gets its name from its location South of Houston Street, but is also a reference to London's Soho. Soho is about 1 square mile 2.6 km2 in area, bounded by Cambridge Circus to the south, Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west, and Charing Cross Road to the east. However, apart from Oxford Street, all of these roads are 19th century metropolitan improvements, and Soho has never been an administrative unit, with formally defined boundaries. The area to the west is known as Mayfair, to the north Fitzrovia, to the east St Giles and Covent Garden, and to the south St James's. According to the Soho Society, Chinatown, the area between Leicester Square to the south and Shaftesbury Avenue to the north, is part of the area. Soho is part of the West End electoral ward which elects three councillors to Westminster City Council. The nearest London Underground stations are Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Leicester Square and Covent Garden. During the Middle Ages, the area that is now Soho was farmland that belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Abingdon and the master of Burton St Lazar Hospital in Leicestershire, who managed a leper hospital in St Giles in the Fields. In 1536, the land was taken by Henry VIII as a royal park for the Palace of Whitehall. The area south of what is now Shaftesbury Avenue did not stay in the Crown possession for long Queen Mary sold around 7 acres 2.8 ha in 1554, and most of the remainder was sold between 1590 and 1623. A small 2 acre 0.81 ha section of land remained, until sold by Charles II in 1676. In the 1660s, ownership of Soho Fields passed to Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, who leased 19 out of the 22 acres 89,000 m2 of land to Joseph Girle. He was granted permission to develop property and quickly passed the lease and development to bricklayer Richard Frith. Much of the land was granted freehold in 1698 by William III to William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, while the southern part of Soho was sold piecemeal in the 16th and 17th centuries, partly to Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester. Soho was part of the ancient parish of St Martin in the Fields, forming part of the Liberty of Westminster. As the population started to grow a new church was provided and in 1687 a new parish of St Anne was established for it. The parish stretched from Oxford Street in the north, to Leicester Square in the south and from what is now Charing Cross Road in the east to Wardour Street in the west. It therefore included all of contemporary eastern Soho, including the Chinatown area. The western portion of modern Soho, around Carnaby Street, was part of the parish of St James, which was split off from St Martin in 1686. Building progressed rapidly in the late 17th century, with large properties such as Monmouth House built for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, Charles II's eldest illegitimate son , Leicester House, Fauconberg House, Carlisle House and Newport House. Soho Square was first laid out in the 1680s on the former Soho Fields. Firth built the first houses around the square, and by 1691, 41 had been completed. It was originally called King Square in honour of Charles II, and a statue of him was based in the centre. Several upper class families moved into the area, including those of Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston and Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle. The square had become known as Soho Square by 1720, at which point it had fashionable houses on all sides. Only No 10 and No 15 from this period survived to the 21st century. Though the Earls of Leicester and Portland had intended Soho to be an upper class estate comparable to Bloomsbury, Marylebone and Mayfair, it never developed as such. Immigrants began to settle in the area from around 1680 onwards, particularly French Huguenots after 1688. The area became known as London's French quarter. The French church in Soho Square was founded by Huguenots and opened on 25 March 1893, with a coloured brick and terracotta facade designed by Aston Webb. A significant event in the history of epidemiology and public health was Dr. John Snow's study of an 1854 outbreak of cholera in Soho. He identified the cause of the outbreak as water from the public pump at the junction of Broad Street now Broadwick Street and Cambridge Street now Lexington Street , close to the rear wall of what is today the John Snow public house. Snow mapped the addresses of the sick, and noted that they were mostly people whose nearest access to water was the Broad Street pump. He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump, thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected. The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage. This is an early example of epidemiology, public health medicine and the application of sciencethe germ theory of diseasein a real life crisis. Science writer Steven Johnson has written about the changes related to the cholera outbreak, and notes that almost every building on the street that existed in 1854 has since been replaced. A replica of the pump, with a memorial plaque and without a handle to signify Snow's action to halt the outbreak was erected in 1992 near the location of the original. By the mid 18th century, the aristocrats who had been living in Soho Square or Gerrard Street had moved away, as more fashionable areas such as Mayfair became available. The historian and topographer William Maitland wrote that the parish so greatly abound with French that is an easy Matter for a Stranger to imagine himself in France. Soho's character stems partly from the ensuing neglect by rich and fashionable London, and the lack of the redevelopment that characterised the neighbouring areas. The aristocracy had mostly disappeared from Soho by the 19th century, to be replaced by prostitutes, music halls and small theatres. The population increased significantly, reaching 327 inhabitants per acre by 1851, making the area one of the most densely populated areas of London. Houses became divided into tenements with chronic overcrowding and disease. The 1854 cholera outbreak caused the remaining upper class families to leave the area. Numerous hospitals were built to cope with the health problem six were constructed between 1851 and 1874. Businesses catering to household essentials were established at the same time. The restaurant trade in Soho improved dramatically in the early 20th century. The construction of new theatres along Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road improved the reputation of the area, and a meal for theatre goers became common. Public houses in Soho increased in popularity during the 1930s, and were filled with struggling authors, poets and artists. Since the decline of the sex industry in Soho in the 1980s, the area has returned to being more residential. The Soho Housing Association was established in 1976 to provide reasonable rented accommodation. By the 21st century, it had acquired around 400 flats. St Anne's Church in Dean Street was refurbished after decades of neglect, and a Museum of Soho was established. On 30 April 1999, the Admiral Duncan pub on Old Compton Street, which serves the gay community, was damaged by a nail bomb that left three dead and 30 injured. The bomb was the third that had been planted by David Copeland, a neo Nazi who was attempting to stir up ethnic and homophobic tensions by carrying out a series of bombings. Soho is near the heart of London's theatre area. It is home to Soho Theatre, built in 2000 to present new plays and comedy. The Windmill Theatre was based on Great Windmill Street, and was named after a windmill at this location that was demolished in the 18th century. It initially opened as the Palais de Luxe in 1910 as a small cinema, but was unable to compete with larger venues and was converted into a theatre by Howard Jones. It re opened in December 1931, but was still unsuccessful. In 1932, the general manager Vivian Van Damm introduced a non stop variety show throughout the afternoon and evening. It was famous for its nude tableaux vivants, in which the models had to remain motionless to avoid the censorship laws then in place. The theatre claimed that, aside from a compulsory closure between 4 and 16 September 1939, it was the only theatre in London which did not close during World War II, leading to the slogan We never closed . Several prominent comedians including Harry Secombe, Jimmy Edwards and Tony Hancock began their careers at the Windmill. It closed on 31 October 1964 and was again turned into a cinema. The Raymond Revuebar at No. 11 Walkers Court was a small theatre specialising in striptease and nude dancing. It was owned by Paul Raymond and opened in 1958. The facade supported a brightly lit sign declaring it to be the World Centre of Erotic Entertainment. Raymond subsequently bought the lease of the Windmill and ran it as a nude entertainment venue until 1981. The upstairs became known as the Boulevard Theatre and in 1980 was adopted as a comedy club called The Comic Strip by a small group of alternative comedians including Rik Mayall, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Alexei Sayle and Adrian Edmondson, before they found wider recognition with the series The Comic Strip Presents on Channel 4. The name and control of the theatre but not the property itself were bought by Raymond's business associate Gerard Simi in 1996. The theatre suffered financial difficulties owing to increasing rent, leading to its closure in 2004. It became a gay bar and cabaret venue called Too2Much in 2005, Elton John staged a joint bachelor party there with his longtime partner David Furnish in anticipation of their civil partnership. The venue was subsequently renamed to the Soho Revue Bar, but closed in 2009. Soho is a centre of the independent film and video industry as well as the television and film post production industry. Twentieth Century House in Soho Square was built in 1937 for Twentieth Century Fox. The British Board of Film Classification, formerly known as the British Board of Film Censors, has been based in the square since 1950. Soho's key fibre communications network has been managed by Sohonet since 1995, which connects the Soho media and post production community to British film studios such as Pinewood and Shepperton, along with other locations worldwide include HBO and Warner Brothers. In the 2010s, research commissioned by Westminster City Council showed 23 per cent of the workforce in Soho works in the creative industries. Many small and easily affordable restaurants and cafes were established in Soho during the 19th century, particularly as a result of Greek and Italian immigration. The restaurants were not looked upon favourably at first, but their reputation changed at the start of the 20th century. In 1924, a guide reported of late years, the inexpensive restaurants of Soho have enjoyed an extraordinary vogue. Arthur Ransome's Bohemia in London 1907 mentions Old and New Soho, including details about Soho coffee houses including The Moorish Cafe and The Algerian. Kettner's was a restaurant on Romilly Street, established in 1867 by Napoleon III's chef Auguste Kettner. It was frequently visited by Albert, Prince of Wales where he is alleged to have dined with his mistress, Lillie Langtry and Oscar Wilde.

Among the original lineup here were Alexei Sayle, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson who broke away in 1980 to establish The Comic Strip team at Raymonds Revue Bar, before they found wider recognition with the series The Comic Strip Presents on Channel 4. The Gargoyle's success and Bohemian clientele led to other restaurants being founded around Soho, including the Eiffel Tower and Bellotti's. During the 1970s the building at 69 Dean Street housed another nightspot in its cellars, initially known as Billy's and run by Soho's only Jamaican club owner, Vince Howard. The Blitz Kids, a group of London clubgoers who spearheaded the New Romantic movement in the early 1980s, originally met at Billy's.

The first coffee bar to open was Moka at No. 29 Frith Street. It was formally opened in 1953 by the film star Gina Lollobrigida, and the frothed coffee produced from stainless steel machines was pioneering in British culture. Le Macabre on Wardour Street, had coffin shaped tables, fostered beat poetry, jive dance and political debate. The Goings On, in Archer Street, was a Sunday afternoon club organised by the beat poet Pete Brown, active in the mid 1960s. For the rest of the week, it operated as an illegal gambling den.

Eric Clapton and Brian Jones both lived for a time in Soho, sharing a flat with future rock publicist, Tony Brainsby. Trident Studios was based at 17 St Anne's Court, Soho and was a major London recording studio. It was established by Norman and Barry Sheffield in 1968, who wanted expand from the small studio they had above their music shop. It became immediately successful after The Beatles decided to record several tracks on The White Album there, as the facilities were better than Abbey Road studios. Queen were originally managed by the Sheffields, and recorded their first four albums and filmed the video for Bohemian Rhapsody at Trident. Other artists who recorded at Trident include David Bowie, Elton John, Free and Thin Lizzy. It closed as a general purpose recording studio in 1981, but has since reopened in various guises, including providing sound and mixing services for television. Although technically not part of Soho, the adjacent Denmark Street is known for its connections with British popular music, and is nicknamed the British Tin Pan Alley due to its large concentration of shops selling musical instruments. The Sex Pistols lived beneath No. 6 and recorded their first demos there. Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie have all recorded at studios on Denmark Street and Elton John wrote his hit Your Song in the street. Led Zeppelin's first rehearsal in 1968 was in a basement studio on Gerrard Street. The Soho area has been at the heart of London's sex industry for more than 200 years between 1778 and 1801, 21 Soho Square was location of the White House, a brothel described by the magistrate Henry Mayhew as a notorious place of ill fame . Shortly before World War I, two rival gangs, one led by Chan Nan also called Brilliant Chang and the other by Eddie Manning, controlled drugs and prostitution in Soho. Both were eventually arrested and imprisoned Manning died midway through a three year sentence in 1933. Following World War II, gangs set up rings of prostitutes in the area, concentrated around Brewer Street and Rupert Street. Photographers also visited Soho in the hope of being able to blackmail people caught in the act of visiting prostitutes. When the Street Offences Act 1959 drove prostitution off the streets, many clubs such as the Blue Lagoon at No. 50 Carnaby Street became fronts for it. Gangs controlled the clubs and the prostitutes, and the police were bribed. In 1960 London's first sex cinema, the Compton Cinema Club a members only club to get around the law , opened at 56 Old Compton Street. It was owned by Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser who later produced two early Roman Polanski films, including Repulsion 1965 . As post war austerity relaxed into the swinging '60s , clip joints also surfaced these unlicensed establishments sold coloured water as champagne with the promise of sex to follow, thus fleecing tourists looking for a good time. Harrison Marks, a glamour photographer and girlie magazine publisher, had a photographic gallery on Gerrard Street and published several magazines in the 1950s and '60s. The model Pamela Green prompted him to take up nude photography, and she remained the creative force in their business. By the 1970s, the sex shops had grown from the handful opened by Carl Slack in the early 1960s. From 1976 to 1982, Soho had 54 sex shops, 39 sex cinemas and cinema clubs, 16 strip and peep shows, 11 sex orientated clubs and 12 licensed massage parlours. The proliferation of sex shops dissuaded some people from visiting Soho. The growth of the sex industry in Soho during this time was partly caused by corruption in the Metropolitan Police. The vice squad at the time suffered from police officers enforcing against organised crime in the area, while simultaneously accepting bribes. This changed following the appointment of Robert Mark as chief constable, who began to crack down on corruption. In 1972 local residents started the Soho Society in order to control the increasing expansion of the sex industry in the area and improve it with a comprehensive redevelopment plan. This led to a series of corruption trials in 1975, following which several senior police officers were imprisoned. This caused a small recession in Soho which depressed property values at the time Paul Raymond had started buying freeholds there. By the 1980s, purges of the police force along with pressure from the Soho Society and new and tighter licensing controls by the City of Westminster led to a crackdown on illegal premises. The number of sex industry premises dropped from 185 in 1982 to around 30 in 1991. By 2000, substantial relaxation of general censorship, the ready availability of non commercial sex, and the licensing or closing of unlicensed sex shops had reduced the red light area to just a small area around Berwick Street. Although several walk ups on streets leading off Shaftesbury Avenue were bought up and closed or renovated for other uses during the mid 2000s, prostitution still takes place in walk ups in parts of Soho, and there is drug dealing on some street corners. Much of the business has been reported to have been run by Albanian gangs. By the end of 2014, gentrification and competition from the internet had reduced the number of flats in Soho used for prostitution, but the area remains a red light district and a centre of the sex industry in London. The National Hospital for Diseases of the Heart and Paralysis was established at No. 32 Soho Square in 1874. The property had previously been owned by the naturalist and botanist Sir Joseph Banks. It moved to Westmoreland Street in 1914, and then to Fulham Road in 1991. In July 2019, Soho was reported to be the unhealthiest place to live in Britain. Researchers from the University of Liverpool found that the area had the greatest access to takeaways, pubs and off licences and these were combined with high levels of air pollution and low levels of parks and green spaces.

Scott kept 39 Gerrard Street open for up and coming British Jazz musicians referred to as 'the Old Place' until the lease ran out in 1967. The 43 Club was based on Gerrard Street. It was one of the most notorious clubs in Soho, run as a cover for organised crime and illegal after hours selling of alcohol and following a police investigation, the owner Kate Meyrick was jailed in 1928. During the 1950s, the cheap rents on Gerrard Street attracted Chinese Londoners, many who moved from Poplar. By 1970, the street had become the centre of London's Chinatown, and it became pedestrianised and decorated with a Chinese gateway and lanterns. It continues to host numerous Chinese restaurants and shops into the 21st century. Golden Square is a garden square to the southwest of Soho. Built over land formerly used for grazing, its name is a corruption of gelding. Building began in 1675 and it was complete by the early 18th century. It was originally home to several upper class residents including Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, James Brydges later to become 1st Duke of Chandos , and Henry St John, 1st Viscount St John. By the mid 18th century, the aristocracy had moved west towards Mayfair, and a number of foreign embassies were established around the square.

"In Norse mythology, Saga Old Norse , possibly meaning seeress is a goddess associated with the wisdom Sokkvabekkr Old Norse sunken bank , sunken bench , or treasure bank . At Sokkvabekkr, Saga and the god Odin merrily drink as cool waves flow. Both Saga and Sokkvabekkr are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess and her associated location, including that the location may be connected to the goddess Frigg's fen residence Fensalir and that Saga may be another name for Frigg. The etymology of the name Saga is generally held to be connected to the Old Norse verb sja, meaning to see from Proto Germanic sehwan . This may mean that Saga is to be understood as a seeress. Since Frigg is referred to as a seeress in the poem Lokasenna, this etymology has led to theories connecting Saga to Frigg. Rudolf Simek says that this etymology raises vowel problems and that a link to saga and segja meaning say, tell is more likely, yet that this identification is also problematic. In the Poetic Edda poem Grimnismal, Sokkvabekkr is presented fourth among a series of stanzas describing the residences of various gods. In the poem, Odin disguised as Grimnir tells the young Agnar that Odin and Saga happily drink there from golden cups while waves resound In the Poetic Edda poem Helgakvia Hundingsbana I, the hero Sinfjotli references Saga in the name of a location found in a stanza where Sinfjotli flyts with Gumundr. The location name, nes Sagu, has been variously translated as Saga's Headland, Saga's Cape, and Saga's ness Part of the stanza may be missing and, due to this, some editors have joined it with the stanza prior. Saga is mentioned once in both the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skaldskaparmal, while Sokkvabekk is only mentioned once, in Gylfaginning. In chapter 35 of Gylfaginning, High tells Gangleri described as king Gylfi in disguise about the asynjur. High follows a description of Frigg and her dwelling Fensalir with Second is Saga. She dwells in Sokkvabekk, and that is a big place. In chapter 75 of the book Skaldskaparmal, Saga is present among a list of 27 asynjur, but no information is provided about her there. John Lindow says that due to similarity between Sokkvabekkr and Fensalir, Odin's open drinking with Saga , and the potential etymological basis for Saga being a seeress has led most scholars to understand Saga as another name for Frigg. Stephan Grundy states that the words Saga and Sokkvabekkr may be by forms of Frigg and Fensalir, respectively, used for the purpose of composing alliterative verse. Britt Mari Nasstrom theorizes that Frigg's role as a fertility goddess is revealed in the name of her abode, Fensalir ... , that Frigg is the same as Saga, and that both the names Fensalir and Sokkvabekkr imply a goddes living in the water and recall the fertility goddess Nerthus . Nasstrom adds that Sokkvabekkr, the subterranean water, alludes to the well of Urd, hidden under the roots of Yggdrasil and the chthonic function, which is manifest in Freyja's character. Rudolf Simek says that Saga should be considered one of the not closer defined Asyniur along with Hlin, Sjofn, Snotra, Var, and Vor, and that they should be seen as female protective goddesses. Simek adds that these goddesses were all responsible for specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons. 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm comments that the gods share their power and influence with goddesses, the heroes and priests with wise women. Grimm notes that Sokkvabekkr is described as a place where cool waters rush and that Odin and Saga day to day drink gladly out of golden cups. Grimm theorizes that the liquid from these cups is",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1ga%20and%20S%C3%B6kkvabekkr
"Sol Old Norse Sun or Sunna Old High German, and existing as an Old Norse and Icelandic synonym see Wiktionary sunna, Sun is the Sun personified in Norse mythology. One of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations, written in the 9th or 10th century CE, attests that Sunna is the sister of Sinthgunt. In Norse mythology, Sol is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda she is described as the sister of the personified Moon, Mani, is the daughter of Mundilfari, is at times referred to as Alfroull, and is foretold to be killed by a monstrous wolf during the events of Ragnarok, though beforehand she will have given birth to a daughter who continues her mother's course through the heavens. In the Prose Edda, she is additionally described as the wife of Glenr. As a proper noun, Sol appears throughout Old Norse literature. Scholars have produced theories about the development of the goddess from potential Nordic Bronze Age and Proto Indo European roots. One of the two Merseburg Incantations the horse cure , recorded in Old High German, mentions Sunna, who is described as having a sister, Sinthgunt. The incantation describes how Phol and Wodan rode to a wood, and there Balder's foal sprained its foot. Sinthgunt sang charms, her sister Sunna sang charms, Friia sang charms, her sister Volla sang charms, and finally Wodan sang charms, followed by a verse describing the healing of the foal's bone. In the poem Voluspa, a dead volva recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future to the disguised god Odin. In doing so, the volva recounts the early days of the universe, in which Benjamin Thorpe translation Henry Adams Bellows translation In the poem Vafrunismal, the god Odin tasks the jotunn Vafrunir with a question about the origins of the sun and the moon. Vafrunir responds that Mundilfari is the father of both Sol and Mani, and that they must pass through the heavens every day to count the years for man In a stanza Vafrunismal, Odin asks Vafrunir from where another sun will come from once Fenrir has assailed the current sun. Vafrunir responds in a further stanza, stating that before Alfroull Sol is assailed by Fenrir, she will bear a daughter who will ride on her mother's paths after the events of Ragnarok. In a stanza of the poem Grimnismal, Odin says that before the Sun referred to as the shining god is a shield named Svalinn, and if the shield were to fall from its frontal position, mountain and sea would burn up . In stanza 39 Odin disguised as Grimnir says that both the Sun and the Moon are pursued through the heavens by wolves the Sun, referred to as the bright bride of the heavens, is pursued by Skoll, while the Moon is pursued by Hati Hrovitnisson. In the poem Alvissmal, the god Thor questions the dwarf Alviss about the Sun, asking him what the Sun is called in each of the worlds. Alviss responds that it is called sun by mankind, sunshine by the gods, Dvalinn's deluder by the dwarves, everglow by the jotnar, the lovely wheel by the elves, and all shining by the sons of the sir . Sol is referenced in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, where she is introduced in chapter 8 in a quote from stanza 5 of Voluspa. In chapter 11 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri described as King Gylfi in disguise asks the enthroned figure of High how the Sun and Moon are steered. High describes that Sol is one of the two children of Mundilfari, and states that the children were so beautiful they were named after the Sun Sol and the Moon Mani . Mundilfari has Sol married to a man named Glenr. High says that the gods were angered by this arrogance and that the gods had the two placed in the heavens. There, the children were made to drive the horses Arvakr and Alsvir that drew the chariot of the sun. High says that the gods had created the chariot to illuminate the worlds from burning embers flying from the fiery world of Muspelheim. In order to cool the horses, the gods placed two bellows beneath their shoulders, and that according to the same lore these bellows are called Isarnkol. In chapter 12 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri tells High that the sun moves quickly, almost as if she were moving so quickly that she fears something, that she could not go faster even if she were afraid of her own death. High responds that It is not surprising that she moves with such speed. The one chasing her comes close, and there is no escape for her except to run. Gangleri asks who chases her, to which High responds that two wolves give chase to Sol and Mani. The first wolf, Skoll, chases Sol, and despite her fear, Skoll will eventually catch her. Hati Hrovitnisson, the second wolf, runs ahead of Sol to chase after Mani, whom Hati Hrovitnisson will also catch. In chapter 35, Sol's status as a goddess is stated by High, along with Bil. In chapter 53, High says that after the events of Ragnarok, Sol's legacy will be continued by a daughter that is no less beautiful than she, who will follow the path she once rode, and, in support, Vafrunismal stanza 47 is then quoted. In the Prose Edda book Skaldskaparmal, Sol is first presented in chapter 93, where the kennings daughter of Mundilfri , sister of Mani , wife of Glen , fire of sky and air are given for her, followed by an excerpt of a work by the 11th century skald Skuli orsteinsson In chapter 56, additional names for Sol are given day star , disc , ever glow , all bright seen , fair wheel , grace shine , Dvalinn's toy , elf disc , doubt disc , and ruddy . In chapter 58, following a list of horses, the horses Arvakr and Alsvir are listed as drawing the sun, and, in chapter 75, Sol is again included in a list of goddesses. Scholars have proposed that Sol, as a goddess, may represent an extension of an earlier Proto Indo European deity due to Indo European linguistic connections between Norse Sol, Sanskrit Surya, Common Brittonic Sulis, Lithuanian Saule, Latin Sol, and Slavic Tsar Solnitse. Regarding Sol's attested personifications in Norse mythology, John Lindow states that even kennings like 'hall of the sun' for sky may not suggest personification, given the rules of kenning formation that in poetry only stanzas associated with Sol in the poem Vafrunismal are certain in their personification of the goddess and that Sol is female and Mani male probably has to do with the grammatical gender of the nouns Sol is feminine and Mani is masculine. Lindow states that, while the Sun seems to have been a focus of older Scandinavian religious practices, it is difficult to make a case for the placement of the sun in a central role in surviving sources for Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek states that Nordic Bronze Age archaeological finds, such as rock carvings and the Trundholm sun chariot, provide ample evidence of the Sun having been viewed as a life giving heavenly body to the Bronze Age Scandinavians, and that the Sun likely always received an amount of veneration. Simek states that the only evidence of the Sun assuming a personification stems from the Old High German Incantation reference and from Poetic Edda poems, and that both of these references do not provide enough information to assume a Germanic sun cult. On the other hand , Simek posits, the great age of the concept is evident by the Trundholm sun chariot, which specifically supports the notion of the Sun being drawn across the sky by horses. Simek further theorizes that the combination of sun symbols with ships in religious practices, which occur with frequency from the Bronze Age into Middle Ages, seem to derive from religious practices surrounding a fertility god such as the Vanir gods Njorr or Freyr , and not to a personified sun.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B3l%20%28sun%29
"Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams is the second studio album by American R B singer and songwriter Solange Knowles. It was released on August 26, 2008, by Geffen Records. Knowles was heavily influenced by the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s prior to the album's recording, prompting her to work with several like minded producers and songwriters such as Jack Splash, CeeLo Green, Mark Ronson, and former HollandDozierHolland member Lamont Dozier. Exploring the lyrical theme of independence, it also incorporates elements of downbeat and electronic music that she had familiarized herself with on previous trips to Europe. Deviating from the R B and dance pop of Knowles' debut album, Solo Star 2002 , Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams featured promotion that aimed at an intellectual, backpacking, coffee shop, digital kid audience, according to her record label. The album debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 46,000 copies in its first week, and spawned three singles that reached number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. Upon its release, Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams received generally positive reviews from most music critics. As of April 2009 , it has sold 138,000 copies in the United States. Knowles had been working on her second studio album on and off since 2005 following her return home to Houston, Texas, and her divorce from Daniel Smith, with whom she had lived following the birth of their son Daniel Julez in October 2004. The follow up to the critical and commercial disappointment of 2003's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007. Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, and by her mother Tina, a one time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, who used to play music by the likes of Dusty Springfield and Martha Reeves to her. Knowles decided to distance herself from the teen pop and dance pop oriented R B sound mainly associated with her previous effort, Solo Star. Willed to create a concept album revolving around her growth as a musical artist instead, she eventually got into the idea of a sweet, soulful record ... based around the Sixties and Seventies, telling stories of where I have been the last couple years. Also borrowing elements from downbeat and electronic music she discovered on recent trips to Europe, her vision of the album eventually resulted in a mixture that Knowles has described as a '60s 70s vintage soul record with hints of electronica. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Geffen Records chairman Ron Fair said of the album prior to release, Her record is totally bananas ... It's not what people would expect from her. The music is more electric and international. She's in her own lane. Although Knowles had previously worked with a wide range of high profile producers and songwriters on earlier projects, she struggled to convince her wishlisted musicians to contribute to Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, production wise. This was due to no producer signing on to the project before hearing any material for the album. I don't think it was offensive, Knowles admitted. I understand that these are people that want to take on credible passionate projects. So before I would work with them I would schedule a meeting and play them the record. And then they were more convinced and willing to get on board. Cee Lo Green and Mark Ronson were not consulted until late into the production of the album, both having been persuaded by Knowles at the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony I had to party with Cee Lo too to get him to work on the record ... but once he did he signed on immediately. Knowles collaborated with several studio personalities, including Jack Splash, Shea Taylor, Mr. Familiar, Lamont Dozier, production teams Soulshock Karlin and Bama Boyz, as well as singers and rappers Pharrell Williams, Bilal, Q Tip and Lil Wayne respectively. In addition, Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry lent vocals to the unreleased recording Wanna Go Back , while Raphael Saadiq and British singer Estelle demoed the track Same Song, Different Man , which didnt make it to the final track listing. In an interview with Starpulse, Knowles later said of the experience By the end of the project, I had worked with all of the producers and artists I had ever dreamed of including Q Tip, Boards of Canada and Mark Ronson ... When I got a call saying the legendary Lamont Dozier would take the time out to write with little old me I was ecstatic beyond words. Inspired by the aspirations of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston My father took me there one day and told me he was going to build a studio, she said in an interview with the Daily Mail. The title is a tribute to his vision. He had a plan and he saw it through. That was a real eye opener for me. It inspired me to dig out my old Marvin Gaye albums and start writing songs. Leading up to its release, Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams featured promotional photography of Knowles in an array of costumes and wigs that evoke late 1960s and early 1970s fashion styles. The record companies of its release, Geffen and Music World Entertainment, aimed at an intellectual, backpacking, coffee shop, digital kid audience in promoting the album. Released on August 26, 2008, the album debuted at number three on the US Billboard Top R B Hip Hop Albums chart, and at number nine on the Billboard 200, with first week sales of 46,000 copies. By April 2009, the album had sold 138,000 copies in the United States. The album's lead single, I Decided , was released on April 22, 2008. It charted at number 44 on the Billboard Hot R B Hip Hop Songs, at number one on the Hot Dance Singles Sales and Hot R B Hip Hop Singles Sales charts, and at number two on the Hot Singles Sales chart. It also peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 6 on the UK R B Singles Chart. ChampagneChroniKnightcap featuring American rapper Lil Wayne was released as a single on August 19. November 25 saw the release of Sandcastle Disco , which reached the number one spot on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. T.O.N.Y. was released as the fourth single on March 31, 2009, topping the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song also charted at number 31 on Billboard's Adult R B Songs, and number 62 on both the R B Hip Hop Airplay and Hot R B Hip Hop Songs. On August 17, 2010, Wanna Go Back was released as a single, and an EP of remixes for I Told You So was released the latter charted at number 5 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. A similar EP featuring remixes of Would've Been the One was released the following week on August 25, and it reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. On October 25, a remix EP was issued for 6 O'Clock Blues . Sol Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 14 reviews. Reviewing the album in The Village Voice, Rob Harvilla called it bizarrely mesmerizing and said that the idiosyncratic and unconventional lyrics of some songs invite inexplicable but highly favorable comparisons to Kate Bush. Ethereal but powerful, unhinged but in total command. Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe referred to the album as a smartly executed, classy set of songs that's miles away from the hoochie pop being turned out by young female R B vocalists these days . Pryia Elan of The Times declared it a modern classic , while Hartford Courant critic Dan LeRoy compared Knowles' music to that of her sister Beyonce. Solange combines retro warmth and current cool in ways her more commercially successful sibling probably can't , Leroy wrote. Jaimie Gill of Yahoo Music called Sol Angel a fine, rich and extremely likeable record , and Francis Jones from Hot Press found Solange's singing sassy and assured . Vibe's Keith Murphy named it one of the best R B albums of the year. Andy Kellman of AllMusic cited it as one of the year's more entertaining and easily enjoyable R B releases and found it fun, silly, slightly eccentric and, most importantly, fearless , with most of the songs soaked in bouncing pop soul . Some reviewers expressed reservations. In MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention and deemed Knowles privilege's child who runs through her options in a defiant but frothy manner, while naming Would've Been the One and I Decided as highlights. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian called its music savvy R B with a gloss you can check your reflection in , but ultimately observed a lack of both memorable tunes and the steely spined ardour that makes Beyonce so compelling. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was ambivalent towards its use of sampling on certain songs, but praised the mix of organic, old school instrumentation and more electronic elements , which he felt make it a loose, fun and reverent record. More critical was Rolling Stone's Jody Rosen, who found it embarrassing for Knowles to attempt Erykah Badu inspired psychedelic soul on tracks such as Cosmic Journey . He also remained unimpressed by her singing and the record's sound, comparing it to a woozy lava lamp glow.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol-Angel%20and%20the%20Hadley%20St.%20Dreams

"The Battle of Solachon was fought in 586 CE in northern Mesopotamia between the East Roman Byzantine forces, led by Philippicus, and the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan. The engagement was part of the long and inconclusive ByzantineSassanid War of 572591. The Battle of Solachon ended in a major Byzantine victory which improved the Byzantine position in Mesopotamia, but it was not in the end decisive. The war dragged on until 591, when it ended with a negotiated settlement between Maurice and the Persian shah Khosrau II r. 590628 . In the days before the battle, Philippicus, newly assigned to the Persian front, moved to intercept an anticipated Persian invasion. He chose to deploy his army at Solachon, controlling the various routes of the Mesopotamian plain, and especially access to the main local watering source, the Arzamon river. Kardarigan, confident of victory, advanced against the Byzantines, but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when Kardarigan reached Solachon. The Persians deployed as well and attacked, gaining the upper hand in the centre, but the Byzantine right wing broke through the Persian left flank. The successful Byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot the Persian camp, but Philippicus was able to restore order. Then, while the Byzantine centre was forced to form a shield wall to withstand the Persian pressure, the Byzantine left flank also managed to turn the Persians' right. Under threat of a double envelopment, the Persian army collapsed and fled, with many dying in the desert of thirst or from water poisoning. Kardarigan himself survived and, with a part of his army, held out against Byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before the Byzantines withdrew. In 572 the Byzantine ruler Justin II reigned 565578 refused to renew the annual payments to Sassanid Persia that had been part of the peace agreement concluded by his uncle, Justinian I r. 527565 and the Persian shah Khosrau I r. 531579 in 562. This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of ByzantinePersian relations over the previous years, which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery. Thus the Byzantines initiated contacts with the Central Asian Gokturks for a joint effort against Persia, while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian Axumites, allies of Byzantium. Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans, and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571572 as a pretext for refusing to continue the payments. Justin's refusal was tantamount to a declaration of war, the fourth fought between the two great powers of Late Antiquity in the 6th century. After initial Persian successes such as the capture of Dara, the conflict proved inconclusive and became a drawn out affair, with Byzantine victories followed by Persian successes, intermittent negotiations, and temporary truces. In 582, Maurice r. 582602 , who had served as a general in the war, ascended to the Byzantine throne at Constantinople by that time, the Persians had gained the upper hand in Mesopotamia through their capture of Dara in 574, while the Byzantines prevailed in Arzanene. Following the failure of another round of peace negotiations, about which little is known, Maurice appointed his brother in law Philippicus as the commander in chief for the Mesopotamian front magister militum per Orientem in 584. Philippicus raided the region around the major Persian fortress of Nisibis in 584, while in 585 he raided in Arzanene. The Persian commander, Kardarigan black hawk , an honorific title rather than a proper name responded with an unsuccessful siege of Philippicus' main base, Monokarton. In spring 586 Maurice rejected new Persian proposals involving the conclusion of peace in exchange for renewed payments in gold. The contemporary historian Theophylact Simocatta reports that Philippicus' army was eager to confront the Persians in battle, and the Byzantine commander marched south from his base at Amida, crossed the Arzamon river modern Zergan in south east Turkey and north east Syria to its eastern bank and advanced some 15 kilometres 9.3 mi east to the plain of Solachon, where he pitched his camp. This position, south of the fortresses of Mardes and Dara, allowed Philippicus' army to control the passage of the Arzamon river and forced the Persian army under Kardarigan to advance across the waterless plain, away from their supply routes, before meeting the Byzantine force. On the Persian side, Kardarigan was also eager to fight and confident of victory. He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he would take. His movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured a few of his men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines. Both armies appear to have been composed exclusively of cavalry, comprising a mix of lancers and horse archers, possibly with a few cataphract units included. When Philippicus' scouts reported the Persians' approach, he positioned his men on elevated ground facing the direction from which the Persian army advanced, with his left flank protected by the foothills of Mount Izalas. The Byzantines appear to have been arranged in a single battle line with three divisions. The left division was commanded by Eiliphredas, the dux of Phoenice Libanensis, and included a Hunnic contingent of horse archers under Apsich. The centre was commanded by the general Heraclius the Elder, later Exarch of Africa and father of Emperor Heraclius r. 610641 , while the right wing was commanded by the taxiarchos Vitalius. This arrangement was also adopted by the Persians as soon as they came into view of the Byzantine army. On the Persian side, the right division was under Mebodes, the centre under Kardarigan himself, and the left wing under Kardarigan's nephew, Aphraates. Unlike the Persian general, Philippicus remained with a small force at some distance behind the main battle line, directing the battle. After a short halt to leave their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly advanced on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw what had happened and reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back. To counter this, Philippicus ordered the men of the central division to dismount and form a shield wall with their lances projecting from it the fulcum formation . It is not clear what happened next, but apparently the Byzantine archers shot at the Persians' horses, breaking their momentum. At the same time, the Byzantine left managed to launch a successful counter thrust which drove back the opposing Persian right in disarray. Soon the Persian right broke and fled, pursued by the Byzantines. With both wings having disintegrated, the Persian centre was now subjected to an attack from the reformed Byzantine right, which drove them towards the area once occupied by the Persian right. Outnumbered and attacked from several sides, the Persians soon began to break and flee. The defeated army suffered greatly, not only from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols. Opening phase of the battle, with the two armies' initial dispositions. Second phase of the battle, with Vitalius's breakthrough on the Byzantine right. Final phase of the battle, with the success of the Byzantine left and the collapse of the Persian army. Following the battle Philippicus rewarded the soldiers who had distinguished themselves and divided the spoils of the defeated Persians among them. He then proceeded to invade Arzanene again. However, his attempt to capture the fortress of Chlomaron was thwarted when Kardarigan arrived with reinforcements. The Byzantine army retreated to the fortress of Aphumon, fighting rear guard actions with the shadowing Persians. The victory of Solachon allowed the Byzantines to regain the upper hand in the region of the Tur Abdin and, in its aftermath, they began to re establish their control over the region around Dara. The war continued for a few years without a decision until the revolt of Bahram Chobin caused the rightful Persian shah, Khosrau II r. 590628 , to find refuge in Byzantine territory. A joint expedition restored him to his throne and a peace treaty was concluded in 591 that left most of Armenia in Byzantine hands.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Solachon
"Valerie Jean Solanas April 9, 1936 April 25, 1988 was an American radical feminist and author best known for writing the SCUM Manifesto, which she self published in 1967, and attempting to murder Andy Warhol in 1968. Solanas had a turbulent childhood. She said her father regularly sexually abused her and she had a volatile relationship with her mother and stepfather after her parents' divorce. She was sent to live with her grandparents but ran away after being physically abused by her alcoholic grandfather. Solanas came out as a lesbian in the 1950s. After graduating with a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, Solanas relocated to Berkeley, California, where she began writing her most notable work, the SCUM Manifesto, which urged women to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex . Solanas moved to New York City in the mid 1960s. She met pop artist Andy Warhol and asked him to produce her play Up Your Ass. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing or stealing. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her 25. In 1967, Solanas began self publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in early 1968. On June 3, 1968, she went to The Factory, where she found Warhol. She shot at Warhol three times, the first two shots missing and the third wounding Warhol. She also shot art critic Mario Amaya and attempted to shoot Warhol's manager, Fred Hughes, point blank, but the gun jammed. Solanas then turned herself in to the police. She was charged with attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and pleaded guilty to reckless assault with intent to harm , serving a three year prison sentence, including treatment in a psychiatric hospital. After her release, she continued to promote the SCUM Manifesto. She died in 1988 of pneumonia in San Francisco. Solanas was born in 1936 in Ventnor City, New Jersey, to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo. Her father was a bartender and her mother a dental assistant. She had a younger sister, Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez. Her father was born in Montreal to parents who immigrated from Spain and her mother was an Italian American of Genoan and Sicilian descent born in Philadelphia. Solanas said that her father regularly sexually abused her. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, in 1949 her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David later David Blackwell by adoption , was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again. Despite this, she graduated from high school on time and earned a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was in the Psi Chi Honor Society. While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men. She was also an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s. She attended the University of Minnesota's Graduate School of Psychology, where she worked in the animal research laboratory, before dropping out and moving to attend Berkeley for a few courses. It was during this time that she began writing the SCUM Manifesto. In the mid 1960s Solanas moved to New York City, where she supported herself through begging and prostitution. In 1965 she wrote two works an autobiographical short story, A Young Girl's Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class , and a play, Up Your Ass, about a young prostitute. According to James Martin Harding, the play is based on a plot about a woman who 'is a man hating hustler and panhandler' and who ... ends up killing a man. Harding describes it as more a provocation than ... a work of dramatic literature and rather adolescent and contrived. The short story was published in Cavalier magazine in July 1966. Up Your Ass remained unpublished until 2014. In 1967, Solanas encountered Andy Warhol outside his studio, The Factory, and asked him to produce her play. He accepted the script for review, told Solanas it was well typed , and promised to read it. According to Factory lore, Warhol, whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity, thought the script was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap. Solanas contacted Warhol about the script, and was told that he had lost it. He also jokingly offered her a job at the Factory as a typist. Insulted, Solanas demanded money for the lost manuscript. Instead, Warhol paid her 25 to appear in his film I, a Man. In her role in I, a Man, she leaves the film's title character played by Tom Baker to fend for himself, explaining I gotta go beat my meat as she exits the scene. Solanas was satisfied with her experience working with Warhol and her performance in the film, and brought Maurice Girodias to see the film. Girodias described her as being very relaxed and friendly with Warhol. Solanas also had a nonspeaking role in Warhol's film Bikeboy, in 1967. In 1967, Solanas self published her best known work, the SCUM Manifesto, a scathing critique of patriarchal culture. The manifesto's opening words are Life in this society being, at best, an utter bore and no aspect of society being at all relevant to women, there remains to civic minded, responsible, thrill seeking females only to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex. Some authors have argued that the Manifesto is a parody of patriarchy and a satirical work and, according to Harding, Solanas described herself as a social propagandist , but Solanas denied that the work was a put on and insisted that her intent was dead serious . The Manifesto has been translated into over a dozen languages and is excerpted in several feminist anthologies. While living at the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas introduced herself to Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her next writing, and other writings . In exchange, Girodias paid her 500. She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that everything I write will be his. He's done this to me ... He's screwed me Solanas intended to write a novel based on the SCUM Manifesto, and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the Up Your Ass script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work. On May 31, 1968, Solanas went to writer Paul Krassner to ask him for 50, which he loaned to her. Krassner later speculated that Solanas could have used the money to buy the gun she used to shoot Warhol, as the shooting was only three days later. According to an unquoted source in The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at 9 00 a.m., Solanas arrived at the Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived. She asked for him at the desk but was told he was gone for the weekend. She remained for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available. In her 2014 biography Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty Fourth Street early that morning. Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind. Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble. Fahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden's then Margo Eden residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce her play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it. As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play a partial copy of an earlier draft of Up Your Ass and other personal papers. Fahs describes how Feiden then frantically called her local police precinct, Andy Warhol's precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol. In some instances, the police responded that You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol, and even asked Feiden Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times, Feiden said that she knew Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it. A New York Times assistant Metro editor responded to an online comment regarding the story, saying that the Times does not present the account as definitive. Fahs additionally cites Assistant District Attorney Roderick Lankler's handwritten notes on the case, written on June 4, 1968, which begin with Margo Feiden's stage name, Margo Eden , address, and telephone numbers at the top of the page. Later that day, Solanas arrived at the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and asked her what she was doing there, and she replied I'm waiting for Andy to get money . Morrissey tried to get rid of her by telling her that Warhol was not coming in that day, but she told him she would wait. At 2 00 p.m. she went up into the studio. Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not coming in and that she had to leave. She left but rode the elevator up and down until Warhol finally boarded it. She entered The Factory with Warhol, who complimented her on her appearance as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to beat the hell out of her and throw her out otherwise. The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head, but her gun jammed. Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table. Warhol was taken to ColumbusMother Cabrini Hospital, where he underwent a successful five hour operation. Later that day, Solanas turned herself in, gave up her gun, and confessed to the shooting, telling a police officer that Warhol had too much control in my life. She was fingerprinted and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York Daily News ran the front page headline Actress Shoots Andy Warhol. Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement that she was an actress. The Daily News changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating I'm a writer, not an actress. At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said it was for the opposite reason , that he has a legal claim on my works. Solanas told the judge that it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me. She told the judge she wanted to represent herself and she declared that she was right in what I did I have nothing to regret The judge struck her comments from the court record and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation. Valerie Solanas on her assassination attempt on Andy Warhol After a cursory evaluation, Solanas was declared mentally unstable and transferred to the prison ward of Elmhurst Hospital. Solanas appeared at New York Supreme Court on June 13, 1968. Florynce Kennedy represented her and asked for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that Solanas was being held inappropriately at Elmhurst. The judge denied the motion and Solanas returned to Elmhurst. On June 28, Solanas was indicted on charges of attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was declared incompetent in August and sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. That same month, Olympia Press published the SCUM Manifesto with essays by Girodias and Krassner. In January 1969, Solanas underwent psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. In June, she was finally deemed fit to stand trial. She represented herself without an attorney and pleaded guilty to reckless assault with intent to harm . She was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year of time served. The shooting of Warhol propelled Solanas into the public spotlight, prompting a flurry of commentary and opinions in the media. Robert Marmorstein, writing in The Village Voice, declared that Solanas has dedicated the remainder of her life to the avowed purpose of eliminating every single male from the face of the earth. Norman Mailer called her the Robespierre of feminism. Ti Grace Atkinson, the New York chapter president of the National Organization for Women NOW , described Solanas as the first outstanding champion of women's rights and a 'heroine' of the feminist movement , and smuggled ... out of the mental hospital where Solanas was confined. According to Betty Friedan, the NOW board rejected Atkinson. Atkinson left NOW and started another feminist organization, According to Friedan, the media continued to treat Ti Grace as a leader of the women's movement, despite its repudiation of her. Another NOW member, Florynce Kennedy, called Solanas one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement. English professor Dana Heller argued that Solanas was very much aware of feminist organizations and activism , but had no interest in participating in what she often described as 'a civil disobedience luncheon club.' Heller also stated that Solanas could reject mainstream liberal feminism for its blind adherence to cultural codes of feminine politeness and decorum which the SCUM Manifesto identifies as the source of women's debased social status. After Solanas was released from the New York State Prison for Women in 1971, she stalked Warhol and others over the telephone and was arrested again in November 1971. She was subsequently institutionalized several times and then drifted into obscurity. The attack had a profound impact on Warhol and his art, and security at the Factory scene became much stronger afterward. For the rest of his life, Warhol lived in fear that Solanas would attack him again. It was the Cardboard Andy, not the Andy I could love and play with, said close friend and collaborator Billy Name. He was so sensitized you couldn't put your hand on him without him jumping. I couldn't even love him anymore, because it hurt him to touch him. Solanas may have intended to write an eponymous autobiography. In a 1977 Village Voice interview, she announced a book with her name as the title. The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed to deal with the conspiracy that led to her imprisonment. In a corrective 1977 Village Voice interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion and that it would be about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would deal very intensively with the subject of bullshit , but she said nothing about parody. In the mid 1970s, in New York City, according to Heller, Solanas was apparently homeless , continued to defend her political beliefs and the SCUM Manifesto , and actively promoted her new Manifesto revision. A decade later, Ultra Violet tracked down Solanas in northern California and interviewed her over the phone. According to Ultra Violet, Solanas was then known as Onz Loh. Solanas stated that the August 1968 version of the manifesto had many errors, unlike her own printed version of October 1967, and that the book had not sold well. She also said that, until told by Violet, she was unaware of Warhol's death. On April 25, 1988, at the age of 52, Solanas died of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery. Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously. Composer Pauline Oliveros released To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation in 1970. In the work Oliveros seeks to explore how Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress. Solanas wished to be supported for her own creative work. In 1996, actress Lili Taylor played Solanas in the film I Shot Andy Warhol, which focused on Solanas's assassination attempt on Warhol played by Jared Harris . Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role. The film's director, Mary Harron, requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground, but was denied by Lou Reed, who feared that Solanas would be glorified in the film. Six years before the film's release, Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas, I Believe , on their concept album about Warhol, Songs for Drella 1990 . In I Believe , Reed sings, I believe life's serious enough for retribution... I believe being sick is no excuse. And I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself. Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol's death from a gallbladder infection 20 years after she shot him. Up Your Ass by Solanas was rediscovered in 1999 and produced in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. The copy Warhol had lost was found in a trunk of lighting equipment owned by Billy Name. Coates learned about the rediscovered manuscript while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a very funny satirist out of Solanas, not just showing her as Warhol's attempted assassin. Solanas's life has inspired three plays. Valerie Shoots Andy 2001 , by Carson Kreitzer, starred two actors playing a younger Heather Grayson and an older Lynne McCollough Solanas. Tragedy in Nine Lives 2003 , by Karen Houppert, examined the encounter between Solanas and Warhol as a Greek tragedy and starred Juliana Francis as Solanas. Most recently, in 2011, Pop , a musical by Maggie Kate Coleman and Anna K. Jacobs, focused mainly on Warhol played by Tom Story . Rachel Zampelli played Solanas and sang Big Gun , described as the evening's strongest number by The Washington Post. Swedish author Sara Stridsberg wrote a semi fictional novel about Solanas called Dromfakulteten English The Dream Faculty , published in 2006. The book's narrator visits Solanas toward the end of her life at the Bristol Hotel. Stridsberg was awarded the Nordic Council's Literature Prize for the book. The novel was later translated into and published in English under the title Valerie, or, The Faculty of Dreams A Novel in 2019. Solanas was featured in a 2017 episode of the FX series American Horror Story Cult, Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins Scumbag . She was played by Lena Dunham. The episode portrayed Solanas as the instigator of most of the Zodiac Killer murders. Solanas's role as a cult figure was solidified with the publication of the SCUM Manifesto and her shooting of Warhol. Harding explained that, by declaring herself independent from Warhol, after her arrest she aligned herself with the historical avant garde's rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater , and that her anti patriarchal militant hostility ... pushed the avant garde in radically new directions. Harding believed that Solanas' assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance. At the shooting, she left on a table at the Factory a paper bag containing a gun, her address book, and a sanitary napkin. Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance, and called attention to basic feminine experiences that were publically taboo and tacitly elided within avant garde circles. Feminist philosopher Avital Ronell compared Solanas to an array of people Lorena Bobbitt a girl Nietzsche Medusa the Unabomber and Medea. Ronell believed that Solanas was threatened by the hyper feminine women of the Factory that Warhol liked and felt lonely because of the rejection she felt due to her own butch androgyny. She believed Solanas was ahead of her time, living in a period before feminist and lesbian revolutionaries such as the Guerrilla Girls and the Lesbian Avengers. Solanas has also been credited with instigating radical feminism. Catherine Lord wrote that the feminist movement would not have happened without Valerie Solanas. Lord believed that the reissuing of the SCUM Manifesto and the disowning of Solanas by women's liberation politicos triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to Vivian Gornick, many of the women's liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing the first wave of radical feminism. At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and Victor Bockris. Breanne Fahs describes Solanas as a contradiction that alienates her from the feminist movement. Fahs argues that Solanas never wanted to be in movement but nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking NOW members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in her lifestyle as a lesbian who sexually serviced men, her claim to be asexual, a rejection of queer culture, and a non interest in working with others despite a dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas's life. She is described as a victim, a rebel, and a desperate loner, yet Solanas' cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a groovy childhood. Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, despite claiming that he sexually abused her. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity. Writer Andrea Long Chu has discussed the influence of Solanas The SCUM Manifesto on her own work It exhilarated me the grandeur, the brutal polemics, the raw, succulent style of the whole thing. Solanas was cool. Chu praised Solanas statement that if men were wise, they would seek to become really female. Solanas statement resonated with her, Chu explained, because it presented a vision of transsexuality as separatism, an image of how male to female gender transition might express not just disidentification with maleness but disaffiliation with men. Here, transition, like revolution, was recast in aesthetic terms, as if transsexual women decided to transition, not to confirm some kind of innate gender identity, but because being a man is stupid and boring.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie%20Solanas
"Solar 2 is an open world sandbox video game developed by Australian developer Jay Watts' video game studio, Murudai. It was released on 17 June 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on 19 June 2011 on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. The game was developed with Microsoft's XNA tools, and its development was inspired by indie games such as flOw. The game follows the player in their mission to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects, eventually becoming a Big Crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. The game is a sequel to Solar 2009 , and features most of the same key gameplay elements of its predecessor, expanded and polished considerably. It was developed over ten months and includes a score composed by sound designer and musician JP Neufeld. Solar 2 received mainly positive reviews from video game journalists, scoring 72 out of 100 on aggregate website Metacritic. It was awarded the first prize at the 2011 Microsoft Dream Build Play competition, and was among the video games showcased at the 10th Penny Arcade Expo. Solar 2 is an open world sandbox video game played from a two dimensional perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects. The game ends when and if the player manages to accumulate enough mass to become a Big Crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, and is able to stay at the form of the object of their preference. Eight different objects are available in the game asteroid, small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star, neutron star and black hole. The game takes place in a borderless and randomly generated universe, filled with asteroids, planets, stars and solar systems. Life forms are also present in the game. They appear on planets sufficiently big to store life, and are represented by a variety of ships of different size and attack power. Spaceships are coloured green if they belong to the player's planet, or to a planet that belongs to the player's solar system red if they belong to an enemy planet or solar system and white if they don't belong to any planet or system. All the spaceships in the map are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence AI , and they will constantly engage in combat against enemy ships, asteroids or planets to destroy them. At the beginning of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player is able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi star systems by selecting planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star. Growing the star will increase its gravitational force, which increases the number of planets the solar system can have. They are also able to attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from a small star to a life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from a small planet to an asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided. Solar 2 also includes a variety of achievements and object oriented missions that can be played at any time. Missions can be found following the directional arrows in the interface, and the AI keeps track of which missions the player has finished. The game also keeps record of several accomplishments the player has reached, such as the distance travelled, the number of objects and enemies destroyed by the player or the spaceships belonging to the player. Solar 2 allows the player to save progress at any point. A save system feature is also present it allows the player to save specific configurations of stars and planets that the player has created. The player can respawn from them at any time. Solar 2 was developed by Jay Watts under his video game studio Murudai. Watts, who received a degree in biotechnology from an Australian college, had no previous knowledge of video game development prior to coding Solar 2's predecessor, Solar, for the Xbox 360. Development of Solar started in July 2008 as a Flash game. Many of the key gameplay elements featured in the sequel, such as the infinite sandbox, were envisioned during this timespan. In an interview with FleshEatingZipper, Watts revealed that Thatgamecompany's indie game flOw was an inspiration for him I loved the simplicity of the game and the ambiance. Solar, released in 2009, became a commercial success it sold 30,000 copies and allowed Watts to work full time on its sequel. Development of Solar 2 lasted for at least ten months. The game was developed using Microsoft XNA, a set of tools focused on video game development created by Microsoft. According to Watts, Solar 2 was mainly expanding on Solar's original idea and polishing it to perfection. However, he commented that the concept of both games took several design iterations to reach its final version I played with many, many ideas before finally settling on what I have now. Sound designer and musician JP Neufeld composed the game's score. According to Watts, this was done because there was no way I could do music as good as he can. Both the Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game were developed simultaneously. About the Xbox 360 version, Watts commented that the lack of keyboards and the aging Xbox 360 hardware were a bit tricky, and updating the Xbox version is a huge pain to do. Solar 2 was released on 17 June 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on 19 June 2011 on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. On July 2012, Watts announced that he was working on Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game. However, given that the original game was developed using the Windows only XNA platform, he expected the ports to be ready sometime before the end of the year. In October 2012, the Mac port was announced and released on Steam. The iPad version of the game was released in March 2013. An Android version was also made available on March 2013. Solar 2 received a positive response from video game journalists upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 72 based on 8 reviews. Most critics praised the physics based gameplay and soundtrack, but criticized the exceedingly difficult missions and somewhat repetitive gameplay. However, the game won the US 20,000 first prize at the 2011 Microsoft Dream Build Play competition, and became a finalist at the 2011 IndieCade festival. Solar 2 was also among the ten indie video games showcased at the 10th Penny Arcade Expo, held in August 2011. IGN's Gord Goble criticized the difficulty of the missions but praised the game's soundtrack, which he called a combination of new age meets Alan Parsons Project meets Pink Floyd meets 2001 A Space Odyssey audioscape. He also highlighted several features he would have liked to see in the game, such as a more complex universe to explore and the ability to control the life forms in the planets controlled by the player. Graham Smith from PC Gamer was also critical of the missions' difficulty, although concluded that it was a good price for a universe. GamePro's Nate Ralph mentioned the life forms as the only negative aspect of the game. The iPad and Android versions of Solar 2 were also well received. App Spy's Andrew Nesvadba, on his review of the iPad version of the game, highlighted the overall sense that nothing about the game feels like a waste of time or effort, but criticized the lack of control over the life forms. Meanwhile, Andrew Martonik from Android Central acknowledged that Solar 2 had all the elements necessary for a great game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%202
"The solar eclipse of May 20, 2012 May 21, 2012 local time in the Eastern Hemisphere was an annular solar eclipse that was visible in a band spanning through Eastern Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and North America. As a partial solar eclipse, it was visible from northern Greenland to Hawaii, and from eastern Indonesia at sunrise to northwestern Mexico at sunset. A solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus ring . An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. The annular eclipse was the first visible from the contiguous United States since the solar eclipse of May 10, 1994 Saros 128 , and the first in Asia since the solar eclipse of January 15, 2010 Saros 141 . The path of the eclipse's antumbra included heavily populated regions of China and Japan, and an estimated 100 million people in those areas were capable of viewing annularity. In the western United States, its path included 8 states, and an estimated 6 million people were capable of viewing annularity. It was the 58th eclipse of the 128th Saros cycle, which began with a partial eclipse on August 29, 984 AD and will conclude with a partial eclipse on November 1, 2282.

The longest duration of annularity was 5 minutes and 43 seconds, occurring just south of the Aleutian Islands. The eclipse began on a Monday and ended on the previous Sunday, as it crossed the International Date Line. The annular eclipse commenced over the Chinese province of Hainan at sunrise, at 6 06 a.m. China Standard Time. Travelling northeast, antumbra of the eclipse approached and passed over the cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Xiamen, reaching Taipei, Taiwan by 6 10 a.m NST. After crossing the East China Sea, it passed over much of eastern Japan, including Nagoya and Tokyo at 7 28 a.m and 7 32 a.m JST respectively, before entering the Pacific Ocean. The penumbra of the eclipse was visible throughout Eastern Asia and various islands in the Pacific Ocean until noon. The path of the antumbra over highly populated areas allowed at least an estimated 100 million people to view annularity. Because the eclipse took place during the summer monsoon season in Southeast Asia, viewing conditions were not ideal in some areas, including Hong Kong. After traveling approximately 4,000 miles 6,500 kilometers across the Pacific Ocean, the antumbra entered North America between the coastlines of Oregon and California, reaching the coastal city of Eureka, California at 6 28 p.m PDT. After passing over Medford, Oregon and Redding, California, it had reached Reno, Nevada by 6 31 p.m PDT. The eclipse continued to travel southeast, passing 30 miles 48 km north of Las Vegas, Nevada, over St. George, Utah, and reaching the Grand Canyon by approximately 6 35 p.m MST. After passing over Albuquerque, New Mexico and Lubbock, Texas, the eclipse terminated above central Texas at sunset, 8 39 p.m. CST. An estimated 6.6 million people lived under the path of the antumbra. The penumbra was visible throughout most of North America, including the islands of Hawaii. This eclipse is a member of the 20112014 solar eclipse semester series. An eclipse in a semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days and 4 hours a semester at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit. This eclipse is a member of the Solar Saros cycle 128, which includes 73 eclipses occurring in intervals of 18 years and 11 days. The series started with partial solar eclipse on August 29, 984 AD. From May 16, 1417 through June 18, 1471 the series produced total solar eclipses, followed by hybrid solar eclipses from June 28, 1489 through July 31, 1543, and annular solar eclipses from August 11, 1561 through July 25, 2120. The series ends at member 73 as a partial eclipse on November 1, 2282. All eclipses in this series occurs at the Moons descending node. This eclipse is a part of a tritos cycle, repeating at alternating nodes every 135 synodic months 3986.63 days, or 11 years minus 1 month . Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee , but groupings of 3 tritos cycles 33 years minus 3 months come close 434.044 anomalistic months , so eclipses are similar in these groupings. The metonic series repeats eclipses every 19 years 6939.69 days , lasting about 5 cycles. Eclipses occur in nearly the same calendar date. In addition, the octon subseries repeats 1 5 of that or every 3.8 years 1387.94 days . All eclipses in this table occur at the Moon's descending node. This eclipse is a part of the long period inex cycle, repeating at alternating nodes, every 358 synodic months 10,571.95 days, or 29 years minus 20 days . Their appearance and longitude are irregular due to a lack of synchronization with the anomalistic month period of perigee . However, groupings of 3 inex cycles 87 years minus 2 months comes close 1,151.02 anomalistic months , so eclipses are similar in these groupings.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20eclipse%20of%20May%2020%2C%202012
"Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of ever evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis. It is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity. The United Nations Development Programme in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,57549,837 exajoules EJ . This is several times larger than the total world energy consumption, which was 559.8 EJ in 2012. In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer term benefits. It will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared . The Earth receives 174 petawatts PW of incoming solar radiation insolation at the upper atmosphere. Approximately 30 is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near infrared ranges with a small part in the near ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150300 watts m2, or 3.57.0 kWh m2 per day. Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans which cover about 71 of the globe and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived. The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000 exajoules EJ per year. In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year. Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth's non renewable resources of coal, oil, natural gas, and mined uranium combined, The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire. Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the Sun and reduce the light available for solar cells. In addition, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established. Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than Geothermal power and Tidal power, derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun. Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar thermal collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies. In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,57549,837 EJ per year see table below . Quantitative relation of global solar potential vs. the world's primary energy consumption Source United Nations Development Programme World Energy Assessment 2000 Solar thermal technologies can be used for water heating, space heating, space cooling and process heat generation. In 1878, at the Universal Exposition in Paris, Augustin Mouchot successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine, but couldn't continue development because of cheap coal and other factors. In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full scale steam engine powered by low pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912. Shuman built the world's first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt, between 1912 and 1913. His plant used parabolic troughs to power a 4552 kilowatts 6070 hp engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres 4,800 imp gal 5,800 US gal of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy. In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun. Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water. In low geographical latitudes below 40 degrees from 60 to 70 of the domestic hot water use with temperatures up to 60 C can be provided by solar heating systems. The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors 44 and glazed flat plate collectors 34 generally used for domestic hot water and unglazed plastic collectors 21 used mainly to heat swimming pools. As of 2007, the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 154 thermal gigawatt GWth . China is the world leader in their deployment with 70 GWth installed as of 2006 and a long term goal of 210 GWth by 2020. Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90 of homes using them. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 GWth as of 2005. In the United States, heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC systems account for 30 4.65 EJ yr of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50 10.1 EJ yr of the energy used in residential buildings. Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy. Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heatheat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment. A solar chimney or thermal chimney, in this context is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses. Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1 3 to 1 2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain. Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and pasteurization. They can be grouped into three broad categories box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers. The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in 1767. A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 90150 C 194302 F . Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of 315 C 599 F and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun. Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project STEP in Shenandoah, Georgia, US where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50 of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the right to dry clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors UTC are perforated sun facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 C 40 F and deliver outlet temperatures of 4560 C 113140 F . The short payback period of transpired collectors 3 to 12 years makes them a more cost effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres 380,000 sq ft had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 9,300 sq ft collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 14,000 sq ft collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds. Solar distillation can be used to make saline or brackish water potable. The first recorded instance of this was by 16th century Arab alchemists. A large scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas. The plant, which had solar collection area of 4,700 m2 51,000 sq ft , could produce up to 22,700 L 5,000 imp gal 6,000 US gal per day and operate for 40 years. Individual still designs include single slope, double slope or greenhouse type , vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi wick, and multiple effect. These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes. Double slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large scale applications. Solar water disinfection SODIS involves exposing water filled plastic polyethylene terephthalate PET bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water. Solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable. Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 19951999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99 , a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non solar applications. The salt melts at 131 C 268 F . It is kept liquid at 288 C 550 F in an insulated cold storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused irradiance heats it to 566 C 1,051 F . It is then sent to a hot storage tank. This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week. When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam generator to produce superheated steam for a turbine generator as used in any conventional coal, oil, or nuclear power plant. A 100 megawatt turbine would need a tank about 9.1 metres 30 ft tall and 24 metres 79 ft in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design. Several parabolic trough power plants in Spain and solar power tower developer SolarReserve use this thermal energy storage concept. The Solana Generating Station in the U.S. has six hours of storage by molten salt. The Maria Elena plant is a 400 MW thermo solar complex in the northern Chilean region of Antofagasta employing molten salt technology. Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics PV , or indirectly using concentrated solar power CSP . CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect. Solar power is anticipated to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption, respectively. In 2016, after another year of rapid growth, solar generated 1.3 of global power. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large concentrated solar power plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and or a feed in tariff. Worldwide growth of PV capacity grouped by region in MW 20062014 In the last two decades, photovoltaics PV , also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286 USD watt and reached efficiencies of 4.56 . By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20 , and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40 . Concentrating Solar Power CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history. Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese, who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth. The common features of passive solar architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion a low surface area to volume ratio , selective shading overhangs and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance. Urban heat islands UHI are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white, and to plant trees in the area. Using these methods, a hypothetical cool communities program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 C at an estimated cost of US 1 billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US 530 million from reduced air conditioning costs and healthcare savings. Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses. Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year round production and the growth in enclosed environments of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers. Development of a solar powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s. The World Solar Challenge is a biannual solar powered car race, where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3,021 kilometres 1,877 mi across central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. In 1987, when it was founded, the winner's average speed was 67 kilometres per hour 42 mph and by 2007 the winner's average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour 56.46 mph . The North American Solar Challenge and the planned South African Solar Challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles. Some vehicles use solar panels for auxiliary power, such as for air conditioning, to keep the interior cool, thus reducing fuel consumption. In 1975, the first practical solar boat was constructed in England. By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively. In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the Sun21 catamaran made the first solar powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 20062007. There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010. In 1974, the unmanned AstroFlight Sunrise airplane made the first solar flight. On 29 April 1979, the Solar Riser made the first flight in a solar powered, fully controlled, man carrying flying machine, reaching an altitude of 40 ft 12 m . In 1980, the Gossamer Penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics. This was quickly followed by the Solar Challenger which crossed the English Channel in July 1981. In 1990 Eric Scott Raymond in 21 hops flew from California to North Carolina using solar power. Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles UAV with the Pathfinder 1997 and subsequent designs, culminating in the Helios which set the altitude record for a non rocket propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres 96,864 ft in 2001. The Zephyr, developed by BAE Systems, is the latest in a line of record breaking solar aircraft, making a 54 hour flight in 2007, and month long flights were envisioned by 2010. As of 2016, Solar Impulse, an electric aircraft, is currently circumnavigating the globe. It is a single seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power. The design allows the aircraft to remain airborne for several days. A solar balloon is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface area to payload weight ratio is relatively high. Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon based fuels such as methanol from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons as plants do requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel cell electric power plants and the pure water by product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants. Hydrogen production technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures 2,3002,600 C or 4,2004,700 F . Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute of Science uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ZnO at temperatures above 1,200 C 2,200 F . This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen. Thermal mass systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or interseasonal durations. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high specific heat capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well designed systems can lower peak demand, shift time of use to off peak hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements. Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber's salt are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures approximately 64 C or 147 F . The Dover House in Dover, Massachusetts was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948. Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The Solar Two project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules 400,000 kWh in its 68 m3 storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99 . Off grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary. Pumped storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator. Beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum. The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the U.S. and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the U.S. SERI, now NREL , Japan NEDO , and Germany Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE . Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20 since 1999. Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154 GW as of 2007. The International Energy Agency has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer term benefits. It will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared. In 2011, a report by the International Energy Agency found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting climate change. The energy from the Sun could play a key role in de carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in energy efficiency and imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters. The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale . We have proved ... that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun. The International Organization for Standardization has established several standards relating to solar energy equipment. For example, ISO 9050 relates to glass in building while ISO 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20energy
"Solar Jetman Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multi directional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released in North America on 14 October 1990 and in Europe on 26 September 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is the third installment of the Jetman series and was later re released by Nintendo for their NES based PlayChoice 10 arcade system in the United States in 1990. In the game, series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship. The game is presented in a horizontal side view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet, which subjects Jetman's craft to various forms of inertia. Similar to its predecessors, Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels. The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare. Ports of the game for the Amiga, Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's presentation and graphics, however criticism was directed at the game's difficulty. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay. The game is a multi directional shooter that is presented in a horizontal side view, in a similar vein to earlier installments of the Jetman series. The game is set after the events of Lunar Jetman and involves series protagonist Jetman on his quest to gather all pieces of the Golden Warpship, a mythical starship that allows interstellar travel. The player controls Jetman's pod in either a clockwise or anti clockwise direction. The pod is subject to inertia but not drag physics depending on the level of gravity of the set planet. The constant pull of gravity changes every level, which makes stable flight challenging and manoeuvring the pod more difficult as the levels progress. Solar Jetman has twelve planets and one hidden planet, each with its own gravity and system of enemy infested caverns. The goal is to navigate these caverns with small jet pods launched from an immobile mothership, on each planet bringing back a piece of the Golden Warpship and enough fuel to journey to the next one. Items are collected with a tow cable that makes flight more difficult due to the drag of the item, and are released over the mothership or deposited in small wormholes deeper in the caverns. Points are earned by retrieving valuables and destroying enemies, and can be spent after every other stage to buy power ups for Jetman's pod. If a pod is destroyed, Jetman will eject out of the pod and walk around in an agile but vulnerable space suit. The player may be able to return to the mothership in order to collect a new pod. If the player dies outside of their pod, a life will be lost. Ste Pickford in a retrospective interview with Retro Gamer Solar Jetman was developed in joint by Mancunian developer Zippo Games and Leicestershire based Rare. Founded by brothers Ste and John Pickford, Zippo Games was known for developing Ironsword, a sequel to Rare's 1987 game Wizards Warriors. Impressed by the success of Ironsword, Rare purchased Zippo Games and commissioned them more development projects, a decision which was viewed unfavourably by Ste Pickford, as he wanted to focus on developing games independently. After the buy out, the Pickford brothers started development of Iota on 1 June 1989, a game which was conceived by programmer Steve Hughes to be an arcade shooter inspired by the Atari ST game Oids. Despite having initial creative control over Iota, Rare ordered Zippo Games to change the game into a Jetman title halfway through development. During the late 1980s, the Stamper brothers sold the rights of Ultimate Play the Game to U.S. Gold and shifted their focus from the British home computing market to broader home console games. The company became one of the first western developers to be granted a licence by Nintendo to produce games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, during which Rare began employing more staff and expanding their operations in order to develop more games for home consoles. After development switched to Solar Jetman, the Pickford brothers received little input from Rare, with Ste Pickford later speculating that the Stamper brothers had confidence in their abilities, despite being entrusted with their most revered series. In a retrospective interview, Ste Pickford stated that he drew inspiration for the mechanics of Solar Jetman from a ZX Spectrum game, Scuba Diving, admitting that the gravitational pulls of Jetman's pod were reminiscent of the way a scuba diver manoeuvred. Development of Solar Jetman lasted around a year and started from a standard two man team to a workforce of several people as the game eventually grew larger in scale. Shortly after release, Sales Curve Interactive announced ports of Solar Jetman for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga, all developed by Software Creations and intended for release on the STORM label. The Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST versions were complete and the ZX Spectrum reached a playable demo state, before the project was cancelled due to poor sales of the NES original and perceived unsuitability for the home computer markets. The Commodore 64 version has subsequently been discovered and made available for download. Despite the cancellations, Solar Jetman was later re released by Nintendo for their NES based PlayChoice 10 arcade system in 1990. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay. The game received positive reviews from critics upon release, despite the poor sales of the NES version. Reviewers of Mean Machines praised the game's playability and gameplay, stating that it was second to none and the different gravity pulls of each planet provided unique challenges . Richard Leadbetter of Computer and Video Games similarly praised the gameplay, comparing it to that of Thrust. Leadbetter found the gameplay challenging and stated that the addition of power ups boosts the game's playability. Steve Jarrett of Total asserted that the gameplay was simplistic but addictive as exploration of the game's twelve planets would set the player at it for weeks . The graphics and sound were also praised. Reviewers of Mean Machines stated that the graphics were simply brilliant and presented an artistic accomplishment , whereas the sound was similarity excellent . Leadbetter stated that the sound and graphics were functional rather than outstanding, despite stating that the graphics appeared fast and smooth . Jarrett regarded the graphics as simple but dead smooth in appearance, also praising the smooth animation of the enemies and the movement of the player's ship. Jarrett also praised the sound, heralding the soundtrack as eerie yet great . The game's playability and replay value were praised by a reviewer of Mean Machines, stating that the number of levels and items will last a couple of months . Jarrett similarly stated that the game's twelve levels provide good replay value due to the game's difficulty.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20Jetman
"Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics PV , indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world, located in the Mojave Desert of California. As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility scale photovoltaic power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the 850 MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China. The International Energy Agency projected in 2014 that under its high renewables scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the worldwide electricity consumption, and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in China and India. In 2017, solar power provided 1.7 of total worldwide electricity production, growing at 35 per annum. As of 2018, the unsubsidised levelised cost of electricity for utility scale solar power is around 43 MWh. Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels see solar power by country . Long distance transmission allows remote renewable energy resources to displace fossil fuel consumption. Solar power plants use one of two technologies A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell PV , is a device that converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost US 286 watt and reached efficiencies of 4.56 . In 1957, Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at Bell Labs. The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell efficiency. The array of a photovoltaic power system, or PV system, produces direct current DC power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current AC , through the use of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency phase. Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets. In these grid connected PV systems, use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back ups. Such stand alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight. Concentrated solar power CSP , also called concentrated solar thermal , uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to concentrate sunlight, then use the resulting heat to generate electricity from conventional steam driven turbines. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists among the best known are the parabolic trough, the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24 hour electricity generation. A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned along the focal points of the linear parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology. Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants. The Stirling solar dish combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a Stirling engine which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime. Parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies. The 50 kW Big Dish in Canberra, Australia is an example of this technology. A solar power tower uses an array of tracking reflectors heliostats to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers can achieve higher thermal to electricity conversion efficiency than linear tracking CSP schemes and better energy storage capability than dish stirling technologies. The PS10 Solar Power Plant and PS20 solar power plant are examples of this technology. A hybrid system combines C PV and CSP with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and biogas. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands. The idea is to increase the efficiency of the combined solar thermoelectric system to convert the solar radiation into useful electricity. Solar PV CSP Solar thermal The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. Charles Fritts installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1 efficient selenium cells, on a New York City roof in 1884. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum. In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems. The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States SERI, now NREL , Japan NEDO , and Germany FraunhoferISE . Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from 1984 to 1996. In the mid 1990s development of both, residential and commercial rooftop solar as well as utility scale photovoltaic power stations began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed in tariffsa policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricityled to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe. For several years, worldwide growth of solar PV was driven by European deployment, but has since shifted to Asia, especially China and Japan, and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world, including, but not limited to, Australia, Canada, Chile, India, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States. Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40 per year from 2000 to 2013 and total installed capacity reached 303 GW at the end of 2016 with China having the most cumulative installations 78 GW and Honduras having the highest theoretical percentage of annual electricity usage which could be generated by solar PV 12.5 . The largest manufacturers are located in China. Concentrated solar power CSP also started to grow rapidly, increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar PV. 51 As of the end of 2013, worldwide cumulative CSP capacity reached 3,425 MW. In 2010, the International Energy Agency predicted that global solar PV capacity could reach 3,000 GW or 11 of projected global electricity generation by 2050enough to generate 4,500 TWh of electricity. Four years later, in 2014, the agency projected that, under its high renewables scenario, solar power could supply 27 of global electricity generation by 2050 16 from PV and 11 from CSP . The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 MW power plant in Riverside County, California, that uses thin film CdTe modules made by First Solar. As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt Topaz Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Gonghe County, Qinghai, China. Commercial concentrating solar power CSP plants, also called solar thermal power stations , were first developed in the 1980s. The 377 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar thermal power plant project. Other large CSP plants include the Solnova Solar Power Station 150 MW , the Andasol solar power station 150 MW , and Extresol Solar Power Station 150 MW , all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24 hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5 pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5 hours of thermal storage. The typical cost factors for solar power include the costs of the modules, the frame to hold them, wiring, inverters, labour cost, any land that might be required, the grid connection, maintenance and the solar insolation that location will receive. Adjusting for inflation, it cost 96 per watt for a solar module in the mid 1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Palo Alto California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt hour. And in sunny Dubai large scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt hour competitive with any form of fossil based electricity and cheaper than most. Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity. Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as feed in tariff programs. Also, Renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean, geothermal, municipal solid waste, hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies. The PV industry has adopted levelized cost of electricity LCOE as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of kilowatt hours kWh . As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local insolation, 1 watt peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2 kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a capacity factor of around 1020 . The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by EPIA, has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years. As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term power purchase agreement. Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90 by 2009. Shi Zhengrong has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. He said We are at a tipping point. No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich. They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies . Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015 . In its 2014 edition of the Technology Roadmap Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the International Energy Agency IEA published prices for residential, commercial and utility scale PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 see table below . However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of 1.80 to 3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of 1.70 to 3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100 kW declined to 1.36 per watt 1.24 W by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around 2.90 per watt. Costs for utility scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as 1.00 per watt. Grid parity, the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, the levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was 0.25 kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below 0.15 kWh for most of the OECD and to reach 0.10 kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements PPAs by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers. Grid parity was first reached in Spain in 2013, Hawaii and other islands that otherwise use fossil fuel diesel fuel to produce electricity, and most of the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015. In 2007, General Electric's Chief Engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015 other companies predicted an earlier date the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10 of commercial customers in the OECD, as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010. The productivity of solar power in a region depends on solar irradiance, which varies through the day and is influenced by latitude and climate. The locations with highest annual solar irradiance lie in the arid tropics and subtropics. Deserts lying in low latitudes usually have few clouds, and can receive sunshine for more than ten hours a day. These hot deserts form the Global Sun Belt circling the world. This belt consists of extensive swathes of land in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, Southwest Asia, Middle East, and Australia, as well as the much smaller deserts of North and South America. Africa's eastern Sahara Desert, also known as the Libyan Desert, has been observed to be the sunniest place on Earth according to NASA. Different measurements of solar irradiance direct normal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance are mapped below North America South America Europe Africa and Middle East South and South East Asia Australia World In cases of self consumption of the solar energy, the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 kWh and insolation of 900 kWh kW, one kWp will save 225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity. A good match between generation and consumption is key for high self consumption, and should be considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited. The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO2 emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers 2.50 watt installed up to 15,000. In net metering the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service. With feed in tariffs, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt hour under a feed in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged. The complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better. In some countries, additional incentives are offered for building integrated photovoltaics BIPV compared to stand alone PV. Alternatively, Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity. In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility more technically the Load Serving Entity is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP . The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000 kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre sell and hedge their credits. Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including Australia, China, Germany, Israel, Japan, and the United States and even across states within the US. The Japanese government through its Ministry of International Trade and Industry ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1 GW. In 2004, the German government introduced the first large scale feed in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20 year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers. Subsequently, Spain, Italy, Greecethat enjoyed an early success with domestic solar thermal installations for hot water needsand France introduced feed in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium EUR 0.55 kWh for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 3050 more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic solar roof programme adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10 kW has internal rates of return of 1015 at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax free. In 2006 California approved the 'California Solar Initiative', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small system FIT of 0.39 per kWh far less than EU countries expires in just 5 years, and the alternate EPBB residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20 of cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed. At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority OPA, Canada began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the Green Energy Act, and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10 MW. The feed in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of 0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate. The overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. Both solar power and wind power are variable renewable energy, meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to where it can be used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off grid and for future 100 renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability. Solar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition solar is intermittent due to day night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a summer peak utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. In winter peak utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their capacity factors. In an electricity system without grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear must go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity see load following power plant . While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly respond to changes in load, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 2040 of total generation, grid connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing baseload generation contracts. Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power water can be held back or released from a reservoir as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days, then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. This cycle can lose 20 of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power. Concentrated solar power plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in high temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44 TJ in its 68 m3 storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99 . In stand alone PV systems batteries are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With grid connected photovoltaic power system, excess electricity can be sent to the electrical grid. Net metering and feed in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid storage stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation. Although not permitted under the US National Electric Code, it is technically possible to have a plug and play PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels. Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the valve regulated lead acid battery a modified version of the conventional leadacid battery, nickelcadmium and lithium ion batteries. Lead acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. Lithium ion batteries have the potential to replace lead acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li ion batteries of plug in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle to grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodiumsulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively. The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and pumped storage hydroelectricity to provide load following power from renewable sources. Research is also undertaken in this field of artificial photosynthesis. It involves the use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues. Unlike fossil fuel based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution. The life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of solar power are in the range of 22 to 46 gram g per kilowatt hour kWh depending on if solar thermal or solar PV is being analyzed, respectively. With this potentially being decreased to 15 g kWh in the future. For comparison of weighted averages , a combined cycle gas fired power plant emits some 400599 g kWh, an oil fired power plant 893 g kWh, a coal fired power plant 915994 g kWh or with carbon capture and storage some 200 g kWh, and a geothermal high temp. power plant 91122 g kWh. The life cycle emission intensity of hydro, wind and nuclear power are lower than solar's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources. Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex one in Maryland, the other in Virginia in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1 kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly. The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL , in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life cycle GHG emissions for solar PV, found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation. For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh m2 year, typical of southern Europe, NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45 gCO2e kWh. Using the same assumptions, at Phoenix, USA, with insolation of 2400 kWh m2 year, the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32 g of CO2e kWh. The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment found that the solar PV would have little impact on the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil fueled power plants. The energy payback time EPBT of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system. Due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market. In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for crystalline silicon PV systems and 11.5 years for thin film technologies S. Europe . These figures fell to 0.753.5 years in 2013, with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems. Another economic measure, closely related to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested EROEI or energy return on investment EROI , which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. This is not the same as the economic return on investment ROI , which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques. With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times 631 reproductions depending on what type of material, balance of system BOS , and the geographic location of the system. Solar power includes plants with among the lowest water consumption per unit of electricity photovoltaic , and also power plants with among the highest water consumption concentrating solar power with wet cooling systems . Photovoltaic power plants use very little water for operations. Life cycle water consumption for utility scale operations is estimated to be 12 gallons per megawatt hour for flat panel PV solar. Only wind power, which consumes essentially no water during operations, has a lower water consumption intensity. Concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling systems, on the other hand, have the highest water consumption intensities of any conventional type of electric power plant only fossil fuel plants with carbon capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption with cooling towers for nuclear 720 gal MWhr , coal 530 gal MWhr , or natural gas 210 . A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal MWhr for coal, 672 gal MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal MWhr. The issue of water consumption is heightened because CSP plants are often located in arid environments where water is scarce. In 2007, the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent. A hybrid wet dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 4 used dry cooling systems. The four dry cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 were wet systems, 7 were dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified. Although many older thermoelectric power plants with once through cooling or cooling ponds use more water than CSP, meaning that more water passes through their systems, most of the cooling water returns to the water body available for other uses, and they consume less water by evaporation. For instance, the median coal power plant in the US with once through cooling uses 36,350 gal MWhr, but only 250 gal MWhr less than one percent is lost through evaporation. Since the 1970s, the majority of US power plants have used recirculating systems such as cooling towers rather than once through systems. One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of cadmium Cd , a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as a buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of cadmium sulfide. The amount of cadmium used in thin film solar cells is relatively small 510 g m2 and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.30.9 microgram kWh over the whole life cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram kWh. In a life cycle analysis it has been noted, that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated. In the case of crystalline silicon modules, the solder material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of lead Pb . Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c Si solar modules. However, there is no fundamental need for lead in the solder alloy. Some media sources have reported that concentrated solar power plants have injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat from the concentrated sunrays. This adverse effect does not apply to PV solar power plants, and some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated. A 2014 published life cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that the large scale implementation of solar and wind potentially reduces pollution related environmental impacts. The study found that the land use footprint, given in square meter years per megawatt hour m2a MWh , was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal fired power plants with 18 m2a MWh. Concentrator photovoltaics CPV systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators when combined with a PV solar cell can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV solar panels drastically. In addition, most solar panels on spacecraft are also made of high efficient multi junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in the inner Solar System. Floatovoltaics are an emerging form of PV systems that float on the surface of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual use facilities with solar power include fisheries. Media related to Solar power at Wikimedia Commons",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20power
"There are several solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the electricity grid. Insolation solar radiation in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers are located in the area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts MW which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014. Nevada Solar One is a solar thermal plant with a 64 MW generating capacity, located near Boulder City, Nevada. The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 MW photovoltaic power plant in Boulder City, Nevada. The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility is a 370 MW facility which consists of three separate solar thermal power plants just off interstate highway 15 on the Nevada California border in the Mojave Desert. There are also plans to build other large solar plants in the Mojave Desert. The southwestern United States is one of the world's best areas for insolation, and the Mojave Desert receives up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar. In 2008, solar electricity was not cost competitive with bulk, baseload power. However, it does provide electricity when and where power is most limited and most expensive, which is a strategic contribution. Solar electricity mitigates the risk of fuel price volatility and improves grid reliability. Since then costs have decreased to make solar electricity increasingly competitive. p.13 While many of the costs of fossil fuels are well known, others pollution related health problems, environmental degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the pricing system, and are thus often referred to as externalities. A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy. Solar thermal power plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times. Solar power towers use thousands of individual sun tracking mirrors called heliostats to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located on top of a tall tower. The receiver collects the sun's heat in a heat transfer fluid that flows through the receiver. The U.S. Department of Energy, with a consortium of utilities and industry, built the first two large scale, demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow, California. Solar One operated successfully from 1982 to 1988, proving that solar power towers work efficiently to produce utility scale power from sunlight. The Solar One plant used water steam as the heat transfer fluid in the receiver this presented several problems in terms of storage and continuous turbine operation. To address these problems, Solar One was upgraded to Solar Two, which operated from 1996 to 1999. Both systems had a 10 MW power capacity. The unique feature of Solar Two was its use of molten salt to capture and store the sun's heat. The very hot salt was stored and used when needed to produce steam to drive a turbine generator that produces electricity. The system operated smoothly through intermittent clouds and continued generating electricity long into the night. Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999, and was converted by the University of California, Davis, into CACTUS, an Air Cherenkov Telescope, in 2001, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere. Trough systems predominate among today's commercial solar power plants. Nine separate trough power plants, called Solar Energy Generating Systems SEGS , were built in the 1980s in the Mojave Desert near Barstow by the Israeli company BrightSource Energy formerly Luz Industries . These plants have a combined capacity of 354 MW. NextEra says that the solar plants power 232,500 homes during the day, at peak power and displace 3,800 tons of pollution per year that would have been produced if the electricity had been provided by fossil fuels, such as oil. Trough systems convert the heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their parabolic shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30 60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390 C 735 F . The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25 of the total output. The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 megawatt MWAC photovoltaic power station approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in the Mojave Desert. It uses approximately 8.8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the Solar Farm has the same 550 MW installed capacity as the Topaz Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity. Nevada Solar One has a 64 MW generating capacity and is located in Boulder City, Nevada. It was built by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and Acciona Solar. Nevada Solar One uses parabolic troughs as thermal solar concentrators, heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers. These solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel, and about 19,300 of these four meter long tubes are used in the plant. Nevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase changing molten salts, which enable energy to be drawn at night. Using thermal energy storage systems, solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet baseload needs. Solar thermal power plants designed for solar only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south western United States. The cost of Nevada Solar One is in the range of 220250 million. The power produced is slightly more expensive than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic PV power. As photovoltaics became less expensive, some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects. The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 megawatt MW solar photovoltaic power plant in Boulder City, Nevada. Sempra Generation began construction of the plant in January 2010 and the facility began generating electricity on December 1, 2010. At its construction peak more than 350 workers were installing the 775,000 First Solar panels on the 380 acre site. The power from Copper Mountain Solar Facility and the adjacent 10 MW El Dorado Solar Power Plant is being sold to Pacific Gas Electric under separate 20 year contracts. Californian utilities were required to obtain 20 percent of their energy supply from renewable energy sources by the end of 2010, increasing to 33 percent by 2020. In December 2007, the U.S. Air Force announced the completion of the Nellis Solar Power Plant, a solar photovoltaic PV system, at Nellis Air Force Base in Clark County, Nevada. Occupying 140 acres 57 ha of land leased from the Air Force at the western edge of the base, this ground mounted photovoltaic system employs an advanced sun tracking system, designed and deployed by SunPower. Tilted toward the south, each set of solar panels rotates around a central bar to track the sun from east to west. The 14 MW system generates more than 30 million kilowatt hours of electricity each year about 82 thousand kilowatt hours per day and supply approximately 25 percent of the total power used at the base. The Nellis Solar Power Plant was one of the largest solar photovoltaic systems in North America. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located 40 miles 64 km southwest of Las Vegas, is the worlds largest solar thermal power plant project, which became fully operational on February 13, 2014. BrightSource Energy received a 1.6 billion loan guarantee from the United States Department of Energy to build the project, which deploys 347,000 heliostat mirrors focusing solar energy on boilers located on centralized solar power towers. In February 2012, Ivanpah was awarded the CSP Concentrating Solar Power Project of the Year by Solar Power Generation USA. The Mojave Solar Project is a solar thermal power facility in the Mojave Desert in California, about 20 miles 32 km northwest of Barstow. Surrounding the hamlet of Lockhart, Mojave Solar is adjacent to Harper Lake and the SEGS VIIIIX solar plant. The 250 MW concentrating solar power CSP plant was estimated to cost 1.6 billion in total and was commissioned in December 2014. The developer, Abengoa, secured a 1.2 billion loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy for the project. The nominal 250 MW solar electric generating facility generates steam in solar steam generators, which will expand through a steam turbine generator to produce electrical power from twin, independently operable solar fields, each feeding a 125 MW power island. The plant should generate 617,000 MWh of power annually, enough power for more than 88,000 households and will prevent the emission of over 430 kilotons of CO2 a year. Pacific Gas Electric has agreed to a 25 year power purchase agreement. The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project now owned by Exelon in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert. In September 2011, the project received a 646 million loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy, and its construction was estimated to generate 350 construction jobs and 20 permanent jobs. It features an innovative utility scale deployment of inverters with voltage regulation and monitoring technologies, which will enable the project to provide more stable and continuous power . Electricity from the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch project will be sold to Pacific Gas Electric Company under a 25 year contract. A 2013 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that the average large photovoltaic plant in the United States occupied 3.1 acres of permanently disturbed area and 3.4 acres of total site area per gigawatt hour per year. The average concentrated solar power plant in the US occupied 2.7 acres of disturbed area and 3.5 acres of total area per GWh yr, A 2015 life cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that concentrating solar power had a land use footprint of 9.0 m2 MWhr for trough, and 14 m2 MWhr for power tower. The concentrating solar footprint was smaller than that of coal power 18 m2 MWhr , but larger than the other sources studied, including ground photovoltaic 7.9 m2 MWhr , natural gas 0.49 m2 MWhr , and wind power 0.26 m2 MWhr . The federal government has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the Bureau of Land Management approved nine large scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, for a total of 3.2 million acres. Currently, 38.2 million acres of onshore public lands and an additional 36.9 million acres of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development, exploration and production. unreliable source Some of the land in the eastern Mojave Desert will be preserved, but the solar industry is mainly interested in areas of the western desert, where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines , said Kenn J. Arnecke of FPL Energy, a view shared by many industry executives. Concentrating solar plants in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling systems have high water consumption intensities compared to other types of electric power plants only fossil fuel plants with carbon capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption with cooling towers for nuclear 720 gal MWhr , coal 530 gal MWhr , or natural gas 210 . A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal MWhr for coal, 672 gal MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal MWhr. In 2007, the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater , 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified. Some solar power plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come under scrutiny for bird mortality. In general, these facilities are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out. However, in the case of concentrated solar power plants such as the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, studies have concluded that a significant number of birds and bats are injured or killed either by colliding into the heliostat mirrors or from burning in solar flux created by the mirror field. Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20power%20plants%20in%20the%20Mojave%20Desert
"Solar urticaria SU is a rare condition in which exposure to ultraviolet or UV radiation, or sometimes even visible light, induces a case of urticaria or hives that can appear in both covered and uncovered areas of the skin. It is classified as a type of physical urticaria. The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on the wavelength of the radiation that causes the breakout another classification system is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout. The agent in the human body responsible for the reaction to radiation, known as the photoallergen, has not yet been identified. The disease itself can be difficult to diagnose properly because it is so similar to other dermatological disorders, such as polymorphic light eruption or PMLE. The most helpful test is a diagnostic phototest, a specialized test which confirms the presence of an abnormal sunburn reaction. Once recognized, treatment of the disease commonly involves the administration of antihistamines, and desensitization treatments such as phototherapy. In more extreme cases, the use of immunosuppressive drugs and even plasmapheresis may be considered. The initial discovery of the disease is credited to P. Merklen in 1904, but it did not have a name until the suggestion of solar urticaria was given by Duke in 1923. However, their research contributed to the study of this uncommon disease. More than one hundred cases have been reported in the past century. Generally, the areas affected are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing however it can also occur in areas covered by clothing. Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only be slightly affected if at all. People with extreme cases will also have reactions to artificial light sources that emit a UV wavelength. Parts of the body only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak. Life with SU can be difficult. Patients are subject to constant itching and pain, as within minutes of the initial exposure to UV radiation a rash will appear. The urticarial reaction begins in the form of pruritus, later progressing to erythema and edema in the exposed areas of the skin. If vast areas of the body are affected, the loss of fluid into the skin could lead to light headedness, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Extremely rarely, patients have been reported to experience an increase in heart rate that can cause a stroke or heart attack due to the body cavity swelling. Other rare side effects can be bronchospasm and glucose instability issues. Also, if a large area of the body is suddenly exposed the person may be subject to an anaphylactic reaction. Once free of exposure, the rash will usually fade away within several hours rare and extreme cases can take a day or two to normalize depending on severity of the reaction. Solar urticaria is an immunoglobulin E mediated hypersensitivity that can be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization. Primary SU is believed to be a type I hypersensitivity a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is induced by UV or visible radiation. Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as tar, pitch, and dyes. People who use drugs such as benoxaprofen or patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this photosensitivity are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light. Also, there have been a few unorthodox unusual causes of solar urticaria. For those susceptible to visible light, white T shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent. It is not yet known what specific agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When people who did not have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen. Solar urticaria can be difficult to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient is experiencing certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation. Another test known as a phototest is the most useful in identifying solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation in order to determine the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form fixed solar urticaria , phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false negative results. A third form of testing is the photoprovocation test which is used to identify disorders instigated by sun burns. The process of this test involves exposing one area of a patient's arm to certain dosage of UVB radiation and one area on the other arm to a certain dosage of UVA radiation. The amount of radiation that the patient is exposed to is equal to that received in an hour of midday summer sun. If the procedure produces a rash, then the patient will undergo a biopsy. Finally, there are laboratory tests which generally involve procedures such as blood, urine, and fecal biochemical tests. In some situations, a skin biopsy may be performed. Solar urticaria, due to its particular features, is considered to be a type of physical urticaria or light sensitivity. Physical urticaria arises from physical factors in the environment, which in the case of solar urticaria is UV radiation or light. SU may be classified based on the wavelength of the radiative energy that causes the allergic reaction known as Harber's classification, six types have been identified in this system. Type I solar urticaria is caused by UVB ultraviolet B radiation, with wavelengths ranging from 290320 nm. Type II is induced by UVA ultraviolet A radiation with wavelengths that can range from 320400 nm. The wavelength range of type III and IV spans from 400 to 500 nm, while type V can be caused by UVB radiation to visible light 280600 nm . Type VI has only been known to occur at 400 nm. Another classification distinguishes two types. The first is a hypersensitivity caused by a reaction to photoallergens located only in people with SU while the second is caused by photoallergens that can be found in both people with SU and people without it. A subgroup of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, has also been identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals swollen areas of the skin that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by a broad spectrum of radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300700 nm. Polymorphous light eruption PMLE is the easiest disease to mistake for solar urticaria because the locations of the lesions are similar the V of the neck and the arms . However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has been mistaken for SU however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction. Histamines are proteins associated with many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light comes in contact with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress the activity of the histamine. Diphenhydramine, a first generation H1 receptor antagonist or medicine that combats the H1 receptor that is associated with many allergic reactions, has been found to be the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per day have been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction. Patients with less potent forms of solar urticaria such as fixed solar urticaria can be treated with the medication fexofenadine, which may also be used prophylactically to prevent recurrence. This form of treatment is meant to reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the allergic reactions people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar urticaria, phototherapy and photochemotherapy are the two major desensitization treatments. Phototherapy can be used for prevention. Exposure to a certain form of light or UV radiation enables the patient to build up a tolerance and outbreaks can be reduced. This type of treatment is generally conducted in the spring. However, the benefits of this therapy only last for two to three days. Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is considered superior to phototherapy because it produces a longer lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is to build up the patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough so that they can be outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week. Some patients and researchers have successfully treated solar urticaria with Omalizumab trade name Xolair which is commonly used to treat Idiopathic Urticaria. Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against IgE. It acts by binding free IgE at the same site that IgE would bind to its high affinity receptor FcRI on mast cells, thereby reducing free IgE in the serum Doctors will sometimes prescribe immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisolone and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, the side effects of these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases. In more extreme cases, plasmapheresis can be considered. This technique is used to remove the blood plasma or fluid in the red blood cells and then return the cells to the body. It removes a circulating factor from the blood that may be involved in causing the urticaria, but is still being tested and is not always effective. When the treatment is a success, the patient's photosensitivity is decreased to the degree that they can undergo PUVA which can result in the relief of the urticarial outbreaks for an extended period of time. The major setback to this treatment is that the side effects can be severe and may include anaphylactoid reactions. In the United States, only about 4 of patients with photosensitive disorders are reported to have been diagnosed with solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3 . Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2 of the African Americans had SU and 8 of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians have a better chance of getting the disease. The age ranges anywhere from 570 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported. Solar urticaria was first identified by P. Merklen in 1904. Just a year later, in 1905, Ward became the first to induce urticaria through exposure to the sun in a controlled environment. The first documented case came in Japan in 1916. The name solar urticaria was proposed in 1923. In 1928 urticaria was induced for the first time. This was carried out by phototesting with increasing amounts of radiation of varying wavelengths. In 1942 the disease was passively transferred to normal volunteers using serum from patients with solar urticaria.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20urticaria
"Solaris Russian , tr. Solyaris is a 1972 Soviet science fiction art film based on Stanisaw Lem's novel of the same name published in 1961. The film was co written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, and stars Donatas Banionis and Natalya Bondarchuk. The electronic music score was performed by Eduard Artemyev a composition by J.S. Bach is also employed. The plot centers on a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris, where a scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the station in order to evaluate the situation, only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. The film was Tarkovsky's attempt to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the science fiction genre, viewing most western entries in the genre as shallow. Solaris won the Grand Prix Special du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. It is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema. Some of the ideas Tarkovsky expresses in this film are further developed in his Stalker 1979 . Psychologist Kris Kelvin Donatas Banionis is being sent on an interstellar journey to evaluate whether a decades old space station should continue to study the oceanic planet Solaris. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father Nikolai Grinko and retired pilot Berton Vladislav Dvorzhetsky . Years earlier Berton had been part of an exploratory team at Solaris but was recalled when he described seeing a four meter tall child on the surface of the water. This was dismissed as a hallucination by a panel of scientists, but now that the remaining crew members are making similarly strange reports, Kris's skills are needed. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station, a scientific research station, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, and he finds the space station in dangerous disarray. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian Sos Sargsyan , has killed himself. The two surviving crewmenSnaut and Sartorius Anatoli Solonitsyn are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin catches fleeting glimpses of others aboard the station who were not part of the original crew. He also finds that Gibarian left him a rambling, cryptic farewell video message, warning him about the station. After a fitful sleep, Kelvin is shocked to find Hari Natalya Bondarchuk , his late wife, in his sleeping quarters. She is unaware of how she got there. Terrified by her presence, Kelvin launches the replica of his wife into outer space. Snaut explains that the visitors began appearing after the scientists conducted radiation experiments using X rays in a desperate attempt to understand the planet's nature. That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her and they fall asleep together in an embrace. Hari panics when Kelvin briefly leaves her alone in the room, and injures herself. But before Kelvin can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. Sartorius and Snaut explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of neutrino systems but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of a device known as the annihilator . Later, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's brainwave patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions. In time, Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence. She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party, which evolves into a philosophical argument, during which Sartorius reminds Hari that she is not real. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking liquid oxygen, only to painfully resurrect after a few minutes. On the surface of Solaris, the ocean begins to swirl faster into a funnel. Kelvin becomes ill and goes to sleep. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, washing away dirt or scabs from his arm. When he awakens, Hari is gone Snaut reads her farewell note, in which she describes how she petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut then tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves into Solaris, the visitors had stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet surface. Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to remain with Solaris. Kelvin meets with his father at their country home. It is later revealed to be on an island in the Solaris ocean. In 1968 the director Andrei Tarkovsky had several motives for cinematically adapting Stanisaw Lem's science fiction novel Solaris 1961 . First, he admired Lem's work. Second, he needed work and money, because his previous film, Andrei Rublev 1966 , had gone unreleased, and his screenplay A White, White Day had been rejected in 1975 it was realised as The Mirror . A film of a novel by Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the USSR, was a logical commercial and artistic choice. Another inspiration was Tarkovky's desire to bring emotional depth to the science fiction genre, which he regarded as shallow due to its attention to technological invention in a 1970 interview, he singled out Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001 A Space Odyssey as phoney on many points and a lifeless schema with only pretensions to truth . Tarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the adaptation. With Fridrikh Gorenshtein, Tarkovsky co wrote the first screenplay in the summer of 1969 two thirds of it occurred on Earth. The Mosfilm committee disliked it, and Lem became furious over the drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the shooting script, which has less action on Earth and deletes Kelvin's marriage to his second wife, Maria, from the story. In the novel Lem describes science's inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient extra terrestrial life may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the movie, Tarkovsky concentrates on Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, and the impact of outer space exploration on the human condition. Dr. Gibarian's monologue from the novel's sixth chapter is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says We don't need other worlds. We need mirrors . Unlike the novel, which begins with Kelvin's spaceflight and takes place entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin's visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives a vibrant Earth versus an austere, closed in space station orbiting Solaris demonstrating and questioning space exploration's impact on the human psyche. The set design of Solaris features paintings by the Old Masters. The interior of the space station is decorated with full reproductions of the 1565 painting cycle of The Months The Hunters in the Snow, The Gloomy Day, The Hay Harvest, The Harvesters, and The Return of the Herd , by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and details of Landscape with the Fall of Icarus and The Hunters in the Snow 1565 . The scene of Kelvin kneeling before his father and the father embracing him alludes to The Return of the Prodigal Son 1669 by Rembrandt. The references and allusions are Tarkovsky's efforts to give the young art of cinema historical perspective, to evoke the viewer's feeling that cinema is a mature art. The film references Tarkovsky's 1966 film Andrei Rublev by having an icon by Andrei Rublev being placed in Kelvin's room. It is the second of a series of three films referencing Rublev, the last being Tarkovsky's next film, The Mirror, which was made in 1975 and which references Andrei Rublev by having a poster of the film hung on a wall. Tarkovsky initially wanted his ex wife, Irma Raush, to play Hari, but after meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, he decided that she was better for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson agreed to be paid in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970, but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko, who cast her in You and I. Half a year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Bondarchuk as Hari after all. Tarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis as Kelvin, the Estonian actor Juri Jarvet as Snaut, the Russian actor Anatoly Solonitsyn as Sartorius, the Ukrainian actor Nikolai Grinko as Kelvin's father, and Olga Barnet as Kelvin's mother. The director had already worked with Solonitsyn, who had played Andrei Rublev, and with Grinko, who appeared in Andrei Rublev and Ivan's Childhood 1962 . Tarkovsky thought Solonitsyn and Grinko would need extra directorial assistance. After filming was almost completed, Tarkovsky rated actors and performances thus Bondarchuk, Jarvet, Solonitsyn, Banionis, Dvorzhetsky, and Grinko he also wrote in his diary that Natalya B. has outshone everybody . In the summer of 1970 the USSR State Committee for Cinematography Goskino SSSR authorized the production of Solaris, with a length of 4,000 metres 13,123 ft , equivalent to a two hour twenty minute running time. The exteriors were photographed at Zvenigorod, near Moscow the interiors were photographed at the Mosfilm studios. The scenes of space pilot Berton driving through a city were photographed in September and October 1971 at Akasaka and Iikura in Tokyo. The original plan was to film futuristic structures at the World Expo '70, but the trip was delayed. The shooting began in March 1971 with cinematographer Vadim Yusov, who also photographed Tarkovsky's previous films. They quarreled so much on this film that they never worked together again. The first version of Solaris was completed in December 1971. The film draws a sharp contrast between Earth, the sensual source of life, and the sterile space station orbiting the planet Solaris, using lively images of underwater plants, fire, snow, rain and other natural phenomena to show Earth's vibrancy. A similar contrast appears at the story's end with Kelvin's winter visit to his father's house, featuring a frozen pond surrounded by bare trees. The dead scenery of this island on Solaris contrasts with the earlier, summer pond scenes of long bladed green grasses or ferns gently floating in the water current underneath blooming trees. The Solaris ocean was created with acetone, aluminium powder, and dyes. Mikhail Romadin designed the space station as lived in, beat up and decrepit rather than shiny, neat and futuristic. The designer and director consulted with scientist and aerospace engineer Lupichev, who lent them a 1960s era mainframe computer for set decoration. For some of the sequences, Romadin designed a mirror room that enabled Yusov to hide within a mirrored sphere so as to be invisible in the finished film. Akira Kurosawa, who was visiting the Mosfilm studios just then, expressed admiration for the space station design. In January 1972 the State Committee for Cinematography requested editorial changes before releasing Solaris. These included a more realistic film with a clearer image of the future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972. The soundtrack of Solaris features Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman , and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude is the central musical theme. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as the score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based on Bach's music featuring Artemyev's music atop it it is heard at Hari's death and at the story's end. Solaris premiered at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix Special du Jury and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. In the USSR, the film premiered in the Mir film theater in Moscow on February 5, 1973. Tarkovsky did not consider the Mir cinema the best projection venue. Despite the film's narrow release in only five film theaters in the USSR, the film sold 10.5 million tickets. Unlike the vast majority of commercial and ideological films in the 1970s, Solaris was screened in the USSR in limited runs for 15 years without any breaks, giving it cult status. In the Eastern Bloc and in the West, Solaris premiered later. In the United States, a version of Solaris that was truncated by 30 minutes premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on October 6, 1976. Although Lem worked with Tarkovsky and Friedrich Gorenstein in developing the screenplay, Lem maintained he never really liked Tarkovsky's version of his novel. Tarkovsky wanted a film based on the novel but artistically independent of it, while Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel. Lem went as far as to say that Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris, omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book. But Lem also said in an interview that he had only seen part of the finale, much later, after Tarkovsky's death. Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece. Tarkovsky's film is about the inner lives of its scientists. Lem's novel is about the conflicts of man's condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe. For Tarkovsky, Lem's exposition of that existential conflict was the starting point for depicting the characters' inner lives. In the autobiographical documentary Voyage in Time 1983 , Tarkovsky says he viewed Solaris as an artistic failure because it did not transcend genre as he believed his film Stalker 1979 did, due to the required technological dialogue and special effects. M. Galina in the 1997 article Identifying Fears called this film one of the biggest events in the Soviet science fiction cinema and one of the few that do not seem anachronistic nowadays. A list of The 100 Best Films of World Cinema compiled by Empire magazine in 2010 ranked Tarkovsky's Solaris at No. 68. In 2002, Steven Soderbergh wrote and directed an American adaptation of Solaris, which starred George Clooney. Salman Rushdie has called Solaris a sci fi masterpiece , adding, This exploration of the unreliability of reality and the power of the human unconscious, this great examination of the limits of rationalism and the perverse power of even the most ill fated love, needs to be seen as widely as possible before it's transformed by Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron into what they ludicrously threaten will be 2001 meets Last Tango in Paris. What, sex in space with floating butter Tarkovsky must be turning over in his grave. Film critic Roger Ebert compared the 2011 film Another Earth with Solaris by noting that Another Earth is as thought provoking, in a less profound way, than Tarkovsky's Solaris, another film about a sort of parallel Earth . In an example of life imitating art, Natalya Bondarchuk Hari revealed in a 2010 interview that she fell in love with Tarkovsky during the filming of Solaris and, after their relationship ended, became suicidal. She claims that her decision was partly influenced by her role. Adam Curtis's 2015 documentary film Bitter Lake includes scenes from this film. The metaphor is that just as the planet influences the cosmonauts who try to influence the planet, there have been cross influences among Afghanistan and its Soviet, American and British invaders. The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The film also has a Certified Fresh rating of 95 on Rotten Tomatoes based on 58 reviews with an average rating of 8.5 out of 10, with the consensus reading Solaris is a haunting, meditative film that uses sci fi to raise complex questions about humanity and existence. Solaris was released on LaserDisc in Japan in 1986. On May 24, 2011, The Criterion Collection released Solaris on Blu ray Disc. The most noticeable difference from the previous 2002 Criterion DVD release was that the blue and white tinted monochrome scenes from the film were restored.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris%20%281972%20film%29
"Soldier is a song by American girl group Destiny's Child, featuring American rappers T.I. and Lil Wayne, from Destiny's Child's fourth studio album Destiny Fulfilled 2004 . Columbia Records released Soldier as the second single from Destiny Fulfilled on November 5, 2004. The trio, Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, co wrote the song with Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison the latter co produced it with Knowles. A Southern hip hop mid tempo song, it lyrically describes each member's favorite type of male love interest. Soldier received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised its composition and the trio's vocal performances, but criticized the lyrical content. The song received a nomination in the category for Best Rap Sung Collaboration at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards and won a Best R B Soul Single by a Group, Band or Duo award at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. A commercial success, Soldier peaked within the top five in six European countries and in Australia, further being certified Gold in the latter region. In the United States, it peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the Dance Club Songs chart, further receiving a Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The black and white music video directed by Ray Kay featured cameo appearances by several rappers and singers. It was nominated at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards under the category of Best Group Video. The band performed Soldier on several televised appearances in 2004 and 2005 and included it on the set list of their final tour Destiny Fulfilled... And Lovin' It 2005 . Both Beyonce and Rowland performed the song during their solo tours after Destiny's Child's disbandment. The song was sampled in many songs by different artists, most notably by Nelly on his single Grillz 2005 . Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison assisted the artists in writing the song, with Harrison handling production alongside Destiny's Child member Beyonce Knowles. It is the only song on the album to feature any guest performers. Soldier was recorded by Jim Caruana at Sony Music Studios in New York City in 2004, with mixing by Dexter Simmons and mastering by Tom Coyne. Garrett initially wrote Soldier in a taxi while going to the studio where the band worked on Destiny Fulfilled he sang the hook to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood from the perspective of having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into. During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with Soldier each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyonce stated that as the song had a Southern feel and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added rawness, realness and edge to the song . During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. If you ask me why, it was Beyonce. That shit was big. Soldier was included on the group's compilation albums 1's 2005 and Playlist The Very Best of Destiny's Child 2012 . Soldier is a mid tempo Southern hip hop song Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine further found elements of Crunk B music while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times noted electropop elements in its composition. Discussing the song musically, Kitty Empire from The Observer classified it as a ghetto anthem in waiting that echoes the Southern bent of much contemporary hip hop . According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Sony ATV Music Publishing, Soldier was composed using common time in the key of C minor with a pulsing hip hop tempo of 75 beats per minute. The vocal elements span from the low note of G3 to the high note of F5. The song is instrumentally complete with ticking staccato synths, fractured, syncopated keyboard instruments, organ stabs, and off kilter kick drums. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan felt that its beat was similar to materials by Dr. Dre. Dimitri Ehrlich from Vibe found major influence of Jay Z in Soldier further saying that T.I. and Lil Wayne... seem like stand ins for Hova . Lyrically, Soldier is a continuation of the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, Lose My Breath . As the singers feel that their man does not fulfill them in the way they want, they tell him I need a soldier , further upping their standards . They request their man to be a thug , proclaiming their love for country boys their preference include a soldier who is street and hood . MacPherson further felt that the trio cruised the ghetto for suitable men with Soldier , an ode to gangsta love . Corey Moss of MTV felt that the song was one of the most personal moments on Destiny Fulfilled in the sense that Beyonce's then relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay Z was acknowledged on record for the first time . Moss further elaborated, Albeit minor, her Beyonce's verse about falling for a guy from the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers. The song opens with T.I. rhyming lines and glorifying the profound love between a thug and a thugette . As the song progresses, each member of Destiny's Child describes their own favorite type of man, later harmonizing together for the chorus. Midway through the song, Lil Wayne's verse contains a reference to rapper B.G.. Williams is the last artist to sing her solo lines, which were described as the sexiest by Rashod Ollisong of The Baltimore Sun. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from the website AllMusic described Soldier as one of the hard driving dance cuts of Destiny Fulfilled further choosing it as a highlight. Similarly, Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine wrote in his review that shoots its load quickly, although just as effectively 'Lose My Breath' and 'Soldier' are stunning, both displaying the Beyonce trademark of creepily submissive lyrics matched with dominatrix vocals and arrangements to superb effect. MacPherson continued praising the song's slow contemptuous grind and the singers' vocal delivery further concluding that T.I. and Wayne get comprehensively owned . The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh described the track as part of the album's lovable material and went on saying, takes a ludicrous premise... and turns it into sharp, coldblooded electro pop . Andy Battaglia writing for The A.V. Club felt that the song and Cater 2 U make sassy end runs around notions of womanly subservience, but their best musical moments hide in tiny melismatic twirls instead of hooks . The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan described the track as juddering while BBC's Nick Reynolds called it good fun . In a review of the song, Tom Breihan, an editor of Pitchfork Media, wrote that Soldier would have been a perfectly acceptable album track on The Writing's on the Wall 1999 , but noted that its sound was different from the songs played on mainstream pop radio. Praising the trio for their vocal performances, he continued 'Soldier' might not carry with it the shock of the new, but it's still a nice little single... The women of Destiny's Child don't sound the slightest bit convincing singing about how they need thug boyfriends, but they wind their voices around a gorgeous hook exactly as well as they always have. T.I. and Lil Wayne stop by, not saying anything but sounding cool and tough and unflappable doing it. It's pretty good, but don't expect it to set your world on fire. Barbara Ellen of The Observer said the song was of the exemplary standard of the band's previous albums, Survivor 2001 and The Writing's on the Wall. Describing it as an overt bid for street cred , Entertainment Weekly's Tom Sinclair felt that T.I and Lil Wayne bring little to the party with their contribution to the song. Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz writing for Billboard magazine felt that the group cemented their street and chart credibility with the song. Another reviewer from the same magazine felt that the band's personal transition from teen dom to womanhood was most evident on Soldier and two other songs from the album. Jenny Eliscu from Rolling Stone wrote in her review, It's a hot track, even if the message feels affected coming from these church girls. For the same reason, Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as a Broadway show tune about thug life. Gil Kaufman from MTV News described the song as a bouncy homage to thug love that featured the signature DC mix of urban grit and slick production . Rashod Ollisong writing for The Baltimore Sun gave a more mixed review for the song, writing It is catchy, but the beat is trite, and the lyrical message is downright trifling before adding that it glorifies a warped image of black masculinity which he heavily criticized. He further argued that the group should put more thought into their lyrics due to the background and image each member created throughout their career. Soldier won in the category for Best R B Soul Single by a Group, Band or Duo during the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination for Best Rap Sung Collaboration but lost to Numb Encore 2004 by Jay Z and Linkin Park. At the 23rd Annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards, Soldier was recognized as one of the Most Performed Songs in 2005 along with the group's other song Lose My Breath . The following year it was one of the Award Winning R B Hip Hop Songs at the 2006 ASCAP Rhythm Soul Music Awards. In 2013, Lindsey Weber from Vulture put Soldier at number nine on her list of the top 25 songs by Destiny's Child. Houston Chronicle's Joey Guerra also included the song in his 2013 list of the band's best songs. The same year it was ranked at number 64 on a list compiled by Andrew Noz from Complex magazine of Lil Wayne's 100 best songs. Similarly, Emily Exton from VH1 listed Soldier at the 19th position of T.I.'s 20 best songs praising his hot intro verse . On the occasion of Beyonce's 32nd birthday, Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz from Billboard included Soldier at number 15 on the list of Beyonce's 30 Biggest Billboard Hits .

The Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA awarded the single with a gold certification in 2005 for shipment of 35,000 copies in that country. Soldier had a similar success on the New Zealand Singles Chart where it peaked at number four on February 21, 2005 and remained at that position for the following three weeks. It further spent the following four weeks in the top ten of the chart and fell off on May 23, 2005. In 2005, the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand RIANZ certified it gold for shipment of 7,500 copies in that country. The music video for Soldier was filmed by Norwegian director Ray Kay and was shot in black and white, becoming the band's first clip using that technique. It marked the first time the group worked with Kay. During an interview, they praised him for shooting the scenes in a fast and convenient way, further describing the experience as wonderful . The video features cameo appearances by seven singers and rappers Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles, Lloyd, Bow Wow, Ginuwine, Ice Cube, WC and Young Jeezy. The video opens with Destiny's Child walking between two rows of males intertwined with close up shots of each member's face. T.I. appears rapping his part wearing a hat, sunglasses and chains. As the song progresses, the members are seen dancing along with the males in the background who also pose for the camera. During the middle of the video, the girls are seen walking with leashed dogs in their hands and Lil Wayne appears rapping his part afterwards. The camera focuses on each member during their solo part in the song as they perform a dance choreography and lip sync the lyrics. During the end of the video, as the group sings the lines known to carry big things , they rub the belly of Solange Knowles who was pregnant at the time of shooting. The clip ends with the girls holding the previously seen dogs in their hands. Throughout the visual, shots of three cars with different registrations are shown a Cadillac from Georgia with the words Da Durty , another car from New York City with the words BK Style and a third car from California with the word Crenshaw . The music video was released on MTV on November 8, 2004. It is also featured on the DualDisc editions of the albums 1's and Destiny Fulfilled as well as on the bonus DVD of the Destiny Fulfilled Tour edition. VH1 aired the video during the program Pop Up Video on November 11, 2011 along with trivial commentary. In 2013 it was included on the album Destiny's Child Video Anthology which contained every music video the group had filmed during their career. Vulture's Lindsay Weber described the clip as camouflage heavy . The video was nominated at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards under the category of Best Group Video but lost to Green Day's Boulevard of Broken Dreams 2004 . In late 2004, the group performed Soldier with T.I. during MTV's Total Request Live TRL . At BET's 106 Park Destiny's Child performed Soldier on November 15, 2004. At the beginning of the performance, Michelle Williams fell onstage during the group's entrance. Williams addressed the incident during an interview in 2014, saying, I had no choice but to get up and act like it didn't happen. Because of YouTube 10 years later, at least once a week, somebody brings it to my attention. She added that it would be the last time she discussed the incident and acknowledged that although it lives on forever a lot of great things have happened to her since then. On November 16, 2004 another performance of the song was during the television show Good Morning America. Destiny's Child appeared on CBS' The Early Show on December 8, 2004 and sang Soldier . The group performed the song again in early February 2005 at the British show Top of the Pops. At the 2005 NBA All Star Game on February 20, 2005 they sang Soldier and Lose My Breath . Destiny's Child also performed Soldier during the concert Rockin' the Corps in April 2005 with the performance being featured on a DVD. In 2005, Soldier was added to the set list of Destiny's Child's final tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It. The group performed it against a backdrop of the American flag dressed in leather clothes taken from Beyonce's clothing line House of Dereon. The live rendition contained a sample from the song Shout It Out from the soundtrack of the film Drumline. Denise Sheppard writing for Rolling Stone felt that the drumline affected version performed during the concert was for the delighted, largely female crowd . While reviewing a concert in the UK, Adenike Adenitire of MTV News praised the group's surprising look inspired by Mad Max noting that they proved that you don't need baggy jeans and a bandanna to be street . Similarly, Barbara Ellen from The Observer felt that the look was emulating all the Mad Max movies at once . The song was included on the track listing of the group's live album Destiny's Child Live in Atlanta 2006 chronicling a concert from the tour in that city for which T.I. and Wayne joined the band onstage performing their parts. It was also sung in Coachella 2018. Following the group's disbandment, both Beyonce and Rowland included Soldier in the set list of their respective solo tours. The former performed it with her male background dancers during a Destiny's Child medley at The Beyonce Experience 2007 along with a snippet of Soulja Boy's Crank That Soulja Boy 2007 . It was subsequently included on the singer's live DVD The Beyonce Experience Live 2007 dubbed as Soldier Boy Crank Mix . Rowland performed Soldier during her headlining concert tour Ms. Kelly Tour 2007 , on several dates during Chris Brown's F.A.M.E. Tour 2011 where she appeared as a supporting act and during the co headlining Lights Out Tour 2013 with The Dream. She also performed Soldier on August 26, 2010 during a promotional concert in New York City and at the Australian Supafest festival in April 2012 backed by male dancers. In 2005, American rapper Nelly sampled Soldier for his song Grillz 2005 featuring Paul Wall, and Ali Gipp from the album Sweatsuit 2005 . Mike Schiller from PopMatters wrote that Jermaine Dupri's production on the song was uncharacteristically fantastic, finding a down 'n' dirty groove in the unlikely source material of Destiny's Child's 'Soldier' . The following year Only God from JME's instrumental mixtape Boy Better Know Edition 4 Tropical 2006 sampled the song. Hip hop artist DJ Drama used a sample of the song in Grillz Gleamin' featuring Lil' Scrappy, Bohagon, Diamond and Princess from his album Gangsta Grillz The Album 2007 . Soldier was also sampled one more time for Body Marked Up 2009 by Willy Northpole, the first single from his debut album Tha Connect.

"Solipskier is a sports video game for Adobe Flash, iOS, and Android developed and published by Mikengreg, the two person team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. In Solipskier, the player draws the snowy slope for an on screen skier to pass through slalom gates and tunnels. The character accelerates with downhill sections and can launch into the air to perform tricks and earn a higher score. The idea came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling with speedy action in the foreground and the ability for the player to paint the terrain. It was Boxleiter and Wohlwend's first game to receive public appreciation. It was released August 29, 2010 to generally favorable reviews and was a runner up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival's Best Mobile Game category. In the sports game Solipskier, the player draws the ground for the on screen skier to pass through a level filled with gates, tunnels, and walls. Drawing an incline, for example, will launch the skier into the air to perform tricks, and a downhill section will accelerate the skier. Upcoming obstacles are indicated at the right of the screen along with the necessary altitude and distance. A streak of successful passes through gates will accrue a bonus score. The skier's speed also increases with time. As an endless runner compared to Canabalt , the characters advance until they die, as there is no end. If the skier travels fast enough, he loses his headphones, which cuts out the background music to the sound of the wind passing by. The player receives All Star Dunk Contest like scorecards after landing big jumps. Solipskier also has an online leaderboard, and offers tips for new players to improve their scores. It focuses on style and emotion from the player character's terminal speed rather than on jumps and tricks. It also has a hard rock guitar soundtrack. Solipskier was designed for the Adobe Flash platform. Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend had worked on Flash games earlier as Intuition Games. The idea for the game came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling, and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed, and eventually Boxleiter blurted out with wide eyes that the player could paint the terrain to determine the speed of the character . They chose a snow or snowmobile theme and began to prototype that same night. Boxleiter used skills he had acquired from previous games heightmaps from Dinowaurs and bitmap drawing from EON to make a mockup within hours a red ball that moved along with a slope made with the mouse and floated down slowly when suspended in air. He added three gates to create a slalom skiing course and a sense of distance and speed, which was not apparent otherwise. Boxleiter then set up indicators to show the incoming gates, though he thought it was odd to have the indicators move to the right as the gate moved to towards the player to the left . There was no parallax scrolling implemented in this phase. Meanwhile, Wohlwend mocked up a 2D course in grayscale, with humps of mountains. He originally designed the visuals such that there would be nothing on the screen where the player had not painted, which was later cut. After seeing Boxleiter's draft, he used crisp colors to make distinct gate markers and made the foreground highly contrast with the background. Their early drafts had a nighttime theme and included an aurora that was later cut due to difficulty of implementation in Flash. Wohlwend left the character design for last as his weak point . Boxleiter was particularly inspired by the idea of a skier replacing the snowmobile, and set up the parallax scrolling and motion blur, which made the skier appear to go faster. He also added the tunnel idea as a series of gates. They animated the skier, who they gave an ego tastic large head on a stick figure body, and decided to not use tutorials, opting for a game that began with the player's first click. Wohlwend's rainbow trail effect was added as a scarf or cape which later became a rainbow burst behind the player , and the scoring mechanics were refined to reward players who took risks by letting the skier fly through the air without touching the screen. This was partly inspired by the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. The title refers to a combination of solipsism and skiing. The game was their first to receive public appreciation. Boxleiter first understood its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS, though they were interested in making bigger games outside the Flash market. They announced the game in mid August 2010, where they revealed that the game would release on Flash through Kongregate and iOS simultaneously, which happened on August 29, 2010. Joe Bergeron, a programmer who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg, helped with the iOS version of the game. Solipskier made around 70,000 in its first two months as compared to 15,000 from the Flash release , which let them work in other non Flash mediums in the future. They released an Android version three months later. The game received generally favorable reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It was a runner up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival's Best Mobile Game category. IGN's Levi Buchanan praised the art direction, especially the rainbow scarf against the gray, monotone background. Chris Hall of 148Apps called it the most original since Fastar . Hall praised the touch of having the headphones fall off, with the contrast between the hard rock guitar and the rushing natural wind, but criticized the complex scoring system. Edge's Chris Donlan, on the other hand, appreciated the trade offs between the different opportunities to score higher. Hall of 148Apps added that Solipskier did not look as great on a Retina Display. Tim Rattray of Slide to Play called the graphics pure eye candy . He felt that the game was unique, but a 'one trick pony' combination of fast Canabalt and platform drawing Line Racer . Likewise, IndieGames.com felt Solipskier's novelty was ephemeral. Pocket Gamer's Mark Brown called its difficulty steeper than the Alps . Pocket Gamer listed the game as one of the toughest and best indie games in 2011, one of the best endless runners in 2012, and a hidden gem in 2013.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipskier
"Hilda Lucia Solis solis born October 20, 1957 is an American politician and a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for the 1st district. Solis previously served as the 25th United States Secretary of Labor from 2009 to 2013, as part of the administration of President Barack Obama. She is a member of the Democratic Party and served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2009, representing the 31st and 32nd congressional districts of California that include East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley. Solis was raised in La Puente, California, by immigrant parents from Nicaragua and Mexico. She earned degrees from the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and the University of Southern California and worked for two federal agencies in Washington, D.C. Returning to her native state, she was elected to the Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees in 1985, the California State Assembly in 1992, and the California State Senate in 1994. She was the first Hispanic woman to serve in the State Senate, and was reelected there in 1998. Solis sought to pass environmental justice legislation. She was the first female recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2000. Solis defeated a long time Democratic incumbent as part of getting elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, where she focused mainly on labor causes and environmental work. She was reelected easily to four subsequent terms. In December 2008, President elect Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Solis as the next U.S. Secretary of Labor. She took office after being confirmed by the United States Senate in February 2009, becoming the first Latina to serve in the U.S. Cabinet. There she focused on workplace safety issues and on strengthening compliance with wage and hour laws. In January 2013, Solis stepped down from her post as Labor Secretary. Returning to the area of her upbringing, in April 2014, Solis formally announced a campaign for a seat on the non partisan Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Solis won the seat outright in a June 3 election and was sworn in on December 1. As Supervisor, Solis successfully lobbied the state to allocate funds for the Exide battery plant cleanup. One of her areas of responsibility was Downtown Los Angeles, where her main priority was dealing with gentrification and the lack of affordable housing. She was unopposed for re election as Supervisor, which took place on June 5, 2018. Solis was born in Los Angeles, California, as the daughter of immigrant parents who had met in citizenship class and married in 1953 Juana Sequeira b. 1926, from Nicaragua and Raul Solis from Mexico . Her father was a Teamsters shop steward in Mexico and, after coming to the United States, worked at the Quemetco battery recycling plant in the City of Industry in the San Gabriel Valley. There he again organized for the Teamsters, to gain better health care benefits for workers, but also contracted lead poisoning. Her mother worked for over 20 years on the assembly line of Mattel once her children were all of school age, belonged to the United Rubber Workers, and was outspoken about working conditions. She stressed the importance of education and was a devout Roman Catholic. Hilda Solis is the third oldest of seven siblings four sisters, two brothers and grew up in a tract home in La Puente, California. She had to help raise her youngest siblings, and later said of her childhood It wasn't what you would call the all American life for a young girl growing up. We had to mature very quickly. She graduated from La Puente High School, where she saw a lack of support for those wishing to continue their education, including a guidance counselor who told her mother that Your daughter is not college material. Maybe she should follow the career of her older sister and become a secretary. However, another counselor did encourage her to attend college, and even went to her house to help her fill out an application. She took her younger sisters to the library to get them to follow her lead. She was the first of her family to go to college, being accepted into the Educational Opportunity Program which assists low income, first generation college students at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Cal Poly Pomona and paying for it with the help of government grants and part time jobs. She graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. She then earned a Master of Public Administration degree at the University of Southern California in 1981.. Solis served near the end of the Carter administration in the White House Office of Hispanic Affairs, where she was editor in chief of a newsletter during a 19801981 Washington semester internship as part of her master's program. At the start of the Reagan administration in 1981, she became a management analyst at the civil rights division of the Office of Management and Budget, but her dislike for Ronald Reagan's policies motivated her to leave later that year. In Washington, she met Sam H. Sayyad, whom she subsequently married. He owns an automobile repair center in Irwindale, California. The couple lives in a modest house in El Monte, California, not far from where she grew up. Returning to California, Solis became Director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982, to help disadvantaged youth gain necessary preparation for college. In particular, she worked with the Whittier Union High School District. Friends urged her to try for elective office, and so in 1985, she ran for the Board of Trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought to increase the number of tenured faculty positions held by minorities and women. She joined several California chambers of commerce, women's organizations, and Latino organizations. She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, a political mentor. Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator Art Torres. Solis had the opportunity to run for the California State Assembly when, after California's 1991 redistricting, the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis's 57th State Assembly district was shifted into another district, while her new representative retired. In the June 1992 Democratic primary to fill the open seat, Solis's opponents had the endorsement of powerful State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and the former incumbent. Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative Barbara Boxer, in an effort that focused on door to door campaigning and featured Solis's mother making burritos for campaign volunteers. Solis came out on top of a three way Democratic race, receiving 49 percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor, future Assemblyman Ed Chavez, who received 31 percent. In the general election, Solis garnered 61 percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods' 34 percent, and gained election to the Assembly. She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly in the wake of the redistricting and became collectively known as Los Siete. Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group. In her one term in the State Assembly, Solis was prominent in the debate on illegal immigration to the United States, backing a bill to allow immigrants in the United States illegally to attend California colleges as long as they were residing in the state. She backed labor and opposed the tobacco industry in supporting a bill that banned smoking in all workplaces. She served on committees dealing with education, labor, and environmental issues, including a new committee that dealt with groundwater contamination and landfill leakage. She was not known as a strong orator. The Democratic incumbent in Solis's 24th State Senate district, Art Torres, gave up his office when he received the 1994 Democratic nomination for the statewide office of California Insurance Commissioner. Solis ran for the seat, won the Democratic primary with 63 percent of the vote against two opponents, and then won the 1994 general election with 63 percent of the vote against Republican Dave Boyer's 33 percent. She became the first Hispanic woman to ever serve in the State Senate and the first woman ever to represent the San Gabriel Valley she was also the Senate's youngest member at that time. She was reelected in 1998 with 74 percent of the vote. In the State Senate, Solis authored 17 bills to prevent domestic violence and championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as a big believer that government, if done right, can do a lot to improve the quality of people's lives . In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from 4.25 to 5.75 it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using 50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was a committed liberal in the pockets of labor , but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff. Solis was an environmental activist in the State Senate, due to concerns that stemmed from a childhood spent within smelling distance of the Puente Hills Landfill and making frequent visits to the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1997, she worked to pass environmental justice legislation with a law to protect low income and minority communities from newly located landfills, pollution sources, and other environmental hazards in neighborhoods that already had such sites. She got the bill, SB 1113, approved over the strong opposition of various business interests, water contractors, and some state government agencies, but Wilson vetoed it. She returned in 1999 with a weakened measure, which was signed by Governor Gray Davis. Calling for the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws , it represented the first legislation of its kind in the nation and is considered a landmark. Solis faced controversy with her 1999 legislation, SB 63, that lowered the carpool restrictions on the El Monte Busway from three or more occupants to two or more. When this took effect in January 2000, it quickly resulted in greatly increased volume on the busway and protests from bus riders and prior carpoolers. Solis at first defended the change, but it continued to have a detrimental effect on the busway and did not improve flow in the regular traffic lanes. By May, she was co sponsoring legislation to rescind the change and restore the higher occupancy requirement, which passed and took effect in July 2000. Due to her work in overcoming obstacles for environmental justice, in 2000 Solis was given the Profile in Courage Award by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, and was praised as a politician who hasn't shied away from challenging the old boy network both within and without the Latino community . She was the first woman to win the award, and gained appearances in George and People magazines and on the Today show. Art Torres, who had become California Democratic Party chair, said of Solis, She's going to be a national star . Term limits would have prevented Solis from seeking reelection to the State Senate. After months of deliberation, she decided to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000 against 18 year incumbent Matthew G. Martinez in the 31st congressional district, which consisted largely of working class Hispanics and Asians. This action was criticized by Hispanics and others, and only two members of Congress, Barbara Boxer and Loretta Sanchez, supported her. Martinez was more conservative than many of his constituents, as he had supported the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA , opposed gun control, and supported bans on specific abortion procedures. He was also criticized for lacking effort and neglecting his district. Solis was able to obtain the support of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor which called her a warrior for working families , Emily's List, Handgun Control Incorporation, the Sierra Club and the California League of Conservation Voters. With their help, Solis outspent Martinez by a 4 to 1 margin and had hundreds of volunteers working for her. She defeated the incumbent Martinez in the March 2000 Democratic primary by a 69 percent to 31 percent margin. On primary night, Martinez called Solis obnoxious and accused her of untruthful advertising. He subsequently switched to the Republican Party, and urged Latinos to vote against her, to no great effect. Without a Republican opponent in the general election, Solis beat three little known challengers from third parties and won 79 percent of the vote. Upon arriving in the House of Representatives, Solis was named freshman class whip, making her responsible for collecting votes from first term Democrats. National Journal magazine named her one of its Ten Freshmen to Watch , and said that her election is a sign of things to come in California and a generational changing of the guard in the Hispanic Caucus . Solis commissioned for her new office a painting of the United States Capitol with the San Gabriel Mountains behind it, so that she would not forget her roots. Her Washington apartment was tiny. As congresswoman, Solis was most known for her work on environmental issues as a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Natural Resources, and the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. She made the promotion of green collar jobs a priority and sponsored the Southern California portion of the California Wild Heritage Act, which would create or enlarge many wilderness areas. In 2003 she sponsored legislation that funded a National Park Service study to designate a large swath of the Angeles National Forest, the Puente and Chino Hills, and the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River, a National Recreation Area. In 2013, after Solis had left the Obama administration, the Park Service recommended proceeding with a greatly reduced version of the original proposal while other advocates evinced disappointment, Solis said it was still a positive step and that Congress could expand the area in whatever legislation it undertook. Solis was not a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, but championed the Employee Free Choice Act and was the only member of Congress on the board of American Rights at Work, a pro union organization that strongly supports the act, for whom she served as treasurer starting in 2004. On trade she voted against both the Dominican RepublicCentral America trade agreement and the U.S. Peru trade agreement, and also expressed opposition to a purposed bilateral U.S. Colombia trade agreement, citing concerns about human rights violations. Solis opposed legislation that would soften job safety requirements. She received 100 percent ratings from several pro labor groups for the years 2005 through 2007, and was a major recipient of union political donations. United Farm Workers co founder Dolores Huerta is one of Solis's role models. During her tenure in the House Solis was an advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. She was one of the leading opponents of H.R. 4437 a House bill sponsored by Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and voted against it. Solis supported legislation aimed at reducing the number of teen pregnancies within Latina and African American communities and sponsored a bill, that became law in 2003, that granted U.S. citizenship to immigrants after one year of military service instead of the previous three years. Solis is Roman Catholic and pro choice. Along with 47 other Catholic members of Congress, she sent a letter to Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, D.C., in order to dissuade him from refusing them the sacraments because of their pro choice legislative voting. Solis signed a Statement of Principles, stating her commitment to her faith as well as her disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church on some issues. They stated that on those issues, such as abortion rights, they decided to follow their conscience instead of the Church teachings. Solis was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and rated a lifetime liberal quotient of 99 percent from Americans for Democratic Action, and a lifetime 2 percent rating from the American Conservative Union. From 2006 to 2008 she wrote blog entries for The Huffington Post. Solis believed in the importance of mentoring, and as a House member continued relationships she had established with up and coming political figures in her district, including California State Assemblywoman Judy Chu and Monterey Park Mayor Sharon Martinez. After the 2000 census and subsequent redistricting, Solis's area became part of California's 32nd congressional district. She was reelected for additional terms in 2002, 2004, and 2006 by very large margins, twice with no Republican in opposition. She ran unopposed in 2008. Solis chaired the Health and the Environment Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus during the 110th Congress. However, during 2006 and 2007, Solis was part of a falling out between several female representatives and Joe Baca, leader of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, arguing there was a lack of respect afforded to women members of the Hispanic Caucus, which Baca denied. She had previously broken ties with the caucus' political action committee over its campaign contributions to Baca's sons. Baca responded that Solis was a kiss up to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a remark for which he later apologized. Solis was indeed considered a close ally of Pelosi, which helped her get a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. She considered running for the position of Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman for the 110th Congress, but deferred to incumbent John Larson after Rahm Emanuel chose to run for caucus chair, which Larson had been running for. Solis's aggressive fundraising for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee gained her a vice chair position on the Democratic Steering Policy Committee. At the time of her selection to Obama's cabinet, she had been elected 2nd vice chair of the Hispanic Caucus and was considered a potential candidate for a leadership position in the House. Solis was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid when that fell short, Barack Obama aggressively sought her support, as part of strengthening his appeal to Hispanic voters. She supported Clinton's effort to establish a U.S. Public Service Academy and was a co sponsor of a House bill to create one. Solis did not become wealthy from her political career by 2008, she and her husband's main assets consisted of retirement funds and his auto shop, valued at under 100,000. On December 18, 2008, sources close to the Obama transition team identified Solis as the President elect's choice for U.S. Secretary of Labor, the last cabinet position yet to be filled. The selection earned praise from the AFL CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a special election in California's 32nd congressional district she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election . Solis's confirmation hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis declined to discuss specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold was placed on the nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress. A vote on Solis's committee confirmation was set on February 5, but postponed after news that Solis's husband Sam Sayyad had just paid 6,400 in outstanding state and local tax liens dating back to 1993 for his auto repair business. Sayyad had filed a separate tax return from Solis, and intended to contest the lien as they were for business taxes he believed to have already paid. A White House spokesperson stated Solis should not be penalized for any mistakes that her husband may have made. The revelations came in the wake of several other Obama nominations troubled or derailed due to tax issues. Committee Republicans subsequently indicated they would not blame Solis, but were still concerned about her ties to American Rights at Work. On February 11, 2009, the committee approved her nomination by voice vote with two votes opposed. After still further delays, Republicans agreed not to subject her nomination to a filibuster and on February 24, 2009, Solis was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 8017. She resigned from the House and was sworn into her new position that evening. A ceremonial swearing in featuring Vice President Joe Biden was later held on March 13. Solis became the first Hispanic woman to serve as a regular U.S. cabinet secretary and the first cabinet secretary with Central American descent. She also became the first Hispanic Secretary of Labor. Solis felt that under the George W. Bush administration, the department had become unimportant and lacking in power, and that its actions reflected a pro business agenda. Accordingly, she hoped to reinvigorate it. In her first days as secretary, Solis affirmed an extension to unemployment benefits specified by the 2009 Obama stimulus package, and joined Vice President Biden's Middle Class Task Force. In her first major speech as secretary, Solis pleased community forum attendees at Miami's Greater Bethel AME Church by vowing more aggressive enforcement of workplace protection laws, saying You can rest assured that there is a new sheriff in town. In late March 2009, Solis vowed to add 250 investigators to the department's Wage and Hour Division after a Government Accountability Office report showed the division's enforcement of wage laws was quite inadequate the staffing up was completed by the end of the year. In late May 2009, Solis suspended immigrant guest worker regulations related to H2A visas adopted in the final days of the Bush administration the move earned plaudits from the United Farm Workers. In July 2009, she expressed concern about workplace deaths among Hispanics, which she said they were especially vulnerable to her continuing attention to issues such as this during her tenure would lead to Hispanic workers considering her their champion . In October 2009, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration levied the largest fine in its history on BP plc for failing to fix safety problems following the 2005 Texas City Refinery disaster. Business groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business complained that Solis was forging a less cooperative relationship, one that departed from the Bush administration's compliance assistance approach the Labor Department said that compliance assistance was still an important part of the new strategy. For 2010, Solis's agenda was to enact some ninety new rules and regulations intended to grant more power to unions and to workers. Whether Solis would try to revive Clinton administration ergonomics rules that had been discarded in the early days of the Bush administration, and that business groups continued to oppose, was unclear. In the wake of the April 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia, the worst in the U.S. in forty years, Solis announced that the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration would conduct an internal review of its enforcement of the Massey Energy mine prior to the accident. She also requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health provide an independent analysis of that review. By the end of her tenure, however, some safety experts said she had fallen short of getting any meaningful new regulatory scheme in place in the wake of the disaster. Later that month, Solis and the department hosted the first ever meeting of the G 20 labor ministers they discussed how to accelerate job creation in their respective countries. Solis also faced disgruntlement from a local of the American Federation of Government Employees representing her own employees, who were unhappy that a longstanding flextime program reduced under the George W. Bush administration had not been restored. The department said the program was modern and fair and that it was part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local. The year also saw the department trying to crack down on firms that illegally use summer internships for free labor, by clarifying what may constitute an unpaid academic internship the move brought resistance from universities. The year additionally saw Solis leading an administration campaign against farmers who employed children or underpaid workers. Proposed new rules in this area were dropped in 2012, however, following adamant criticism from conservatives and agricultural groups. In February 2011, as protests continued over Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's proposal to limit that state's public employee unions' collective bargaining rights, and similar proposals were made in other states, Solis spoke out strongly and emotionally against such moves, saying aren't just asking workers to tighten their belts, they're demanding they give up their uniquely American rights as workers . Overall, however, the Obama administration did not speak out forcefully against these moves. In October 2012, Solis defended the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the Current Population Survey it puts out monthly reported that unemployment in the United States had fallen below eight percent for this first time since Obama took office. Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. Solis said, I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement. For the year, the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations, 280 million going to some 300,000 workers. Workplace fatalities in construction and general industrial sectors reached an all time low. On January 9, 2013, Solis tendered her resignation as Secretary of Labor, becoming one of several Cabinet members deciding not to stay on for Obama's second term. Her last day in office was January 22, 2013. Solis, who had never become part of the inner circle of presidential advisors, said it had been a difficult decision and Obama praised her work as secretary. Reflecting upon her tenure, Solis generally garnered praise from labor unions and leading Democrats for her stricter enforcement of job safety regulations and more aggressive pursuit of wage and hour violators. Other leaders and analysts in the labor field thought her performance as secretary was underwhelming, with minimal public visibility and no memorable legacy left behind. All agreed that she operated in a difficult political environment, with the effects of the Great Recession still being felt, Republicans staunchly opposed to labor based initiatives, and the Obama administration's attentions focused elsewhere. Business groups, meanwhile, continued to characterize her as having been uncooperative in her dealings with them. During early 2014, reports emerged that the United States Office of Special Counsel, the United States Department of Justice, and the FBI had begun investigating Solis during 2012 for possible violations of fundraising rules by federal officials during her time as Labor Secretary. Allegations were made that Solis solicited subordinates for funds for the 2012 re election campaign of President Obama. A spokesperson for Solis said that she believed she had done nothing wrong. The matter was also being looked into by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and its chair, Representative Darrell Issa, who said there was evidence supporting the allegations. By early 2016, no further word had emerged on any of these investigations. Solis's departure from the Labor Department was speculated as a preparation for a run for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 2014, to replace the term limited incumbent, 1st District supervisor Gloria Molina. Officially, Solis only said that she wanted to rest, reconnect with her local community after twelve years in Washington, and spend time with her mother, who was 87 years old at the time. Later during January 2013, Solis confirmed her interest in the County Board of Supervisors race, saying I'm going to take a look at it. In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member would be interested in a county level body, analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county level legislative body in the United States, and exercises some executive and quasi judicial powers as well. It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department's and its 26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis' old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after Governor, U.S. Senator, and Mayor of Los Angeles. The supervisors have long been nicknamed the five little kings . In November 2013, Solis became a scholar in residence at her alma mater of Cal Poly Pomona. Her duties were to include guest lecturing in classes, mentoring students, and assisting in curriculum development, with a focus in political science. On April 5, 2014, Solis formally announced the start of her campaign for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat, with the election to be held on June 3. By this time she had raised over 600,000 for her effort and was considered the favorite to win the contest. News of the federal investigation had little effect on her campaign. Solis won the seat on June 4, 2014, garnering 70 percent of the vote against two other opponents. The margin meant she won the seat outright and would not need to run in a runoff election. As Supervisor for District 1, she was at the forefront of the response to the Exide lead contamination issue, which affected Vernon and several other communities within her purview and which touched upon her past concerns with environmental justice. The Supervisors allocated some county money for cleanup, with Solis saying, the state continues to drag its feet . Going to the state capitol and asking for additional funds to remedy the situation, she said, This has gone on too long. In February 2016 she praised Governor Jerry Brown for finally increasing state funds for the cleanup, saying Our voices were heard. For too long we have seen two Americas one in which affluent neighborhoods get immediate help and relief. The other America is made up of poor working class families who silently suffer. Today's announcement from the governor reconciles these two Americas. Among the other areas Solis was responsible for was Downtown Los Angeles. There she said her main priority was dealing with gentrification and the lack of affordable housing. By 2017, data showed that, under her tenure, the homeless rate had gone up by 48 percent in her district, with a 36 percent increase in the San Gabriel Valley itself. The increase was attributed by officials familiar with the problem to constantly increasing housing costs combined with flat incomes. Solis said in response, With increasingly out of control rents, we need more tools to secure housing stability for the most vulnerable County residents. Regarding the new job as a whole, Solis said, It's fascinating how many people work for the county over 100,000. At the Department of Labor it was like 15,000. The budget here is 26 billion, much more than what I was used to in D.C. In December 2015 Solis took over as Chair of the Supervisors, a position which is rotated on a yearly basis. She said a priority for 2016 would be to reaffirm our commitment to our diverse county family to make this family, our family, inclusive for everybody, no matter their background, no matter where they come from, no matter how far down the scale they have been. One of her efforts went towards getting additional resources for older children who were transitioning out of the foster care system. Following the results of the 2016 United States presidential election and the fear of mass deportations that ensued due to the victor, Solis worked together with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to create the 10 million L.A. Justice Fund, which would provide legal services to illegal immigrants facing deportation. In May 2017, Solis voted in favor of retaining designation of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, created in 2014 but under review, along with other recently created national monuments, by new U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke for possible revocation. Solis also favored a parcel tax to increase the number of parks and playgrounds in Los Angeles. In October 2017 a motion that she authored passed the board and resulted in Columbus Day being demoted as an official holiday in Los Angeles County and it being replaced with Indigenous Peoples Day. She said in a statement, This action is about publicly recognizing that America's ancestors, for centuries, oppressed certain minority groups. This is not about erasing history I believe the full history and impact of Christopher Columbus should be taught to current and future generations. While we cannot change the past, we can realize the pain that millions suffered throughout our nation's history, as well as the tremendous achievements of the original inhabitants of our continent. In January 2018, Solis and the other supervisors supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as interim public defender, despite a letter signed by 390 public defenders who were concerned that Tinkham lacked criminal law experience and the potential for a conflict of interest, given Tinkham's prior representation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors election, 2018, Solis ran unopposed, and was accordingly re elected on June 5, 2018. A lack of serious opposition, or any opposition at all, is not unusual for incumbent Supervisors. During 2019 Solis, with fellow supervisor Sheila Kuehl, was a leader of the successful effort to stop a planned 1.7 billion mental health treatment center in the downtown area, intended to replace Men's Central Jail. Solis and others argued that the new facility would become a de facto jail and instead urged the creation of smaller treatment facilities spread around the county. Solis said in reference to contractors for any such project, I don't want to see people who are just used to building brick and mortar. I want to see people who have a humanistic approach. Solis also became an active supporter for the Joe Biden presidential campaign, 2020, saying that the former vice president, whom she dealt with during her time as Secretary of Labor, had the necessary steady hand and experience and who also is personable and can interact well with a wide range of people.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda%20Solis
"William Mapother as Ethan RomMira Furlan as Danielle RousseauAndrea Gabriel as Nadia JazeemScott Paulin as SullivanNavid Negahban as OmarXavier Alaniz as Falah Solitary is the ninth episode of the first season of Lost, an American television drama series following the survivors of a plane crash stranded on a tropical island. The episode was directed by Greg Yaitanes and written by David Fury. It first aired on November 17, 2004, on the American Broadcasting Company ABC . Sayid Jarrah Naveen Andrews is captured by a mysterious French person, who is later revealed to be Danielle Rousseau Mira Furlan , a woman who shipwrecked on the island sixteen years before the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 and was alone for almost the entire time. At the island's camp, Hugo Hurley Reyes Jorge Garcia creates a golf course in an attempt to relieve the survivors' stress and worry. In flashbacks, Sayid meets a childhood friend, but must interrogate her. Solitary marked the introduction of mythology into Lost, and also solved the first mystery of the series the origin of the transmission heard in part two of the pilot episode. It also introduced Danielle Rousseau, who would be in a total of 22 episodes through the show. The episode's initial broadcast in the United States attracted 17.64 million viewers. It has had a generally positive reception by critics. Sayid is torturing a Shiite prisoner suspected of bombing the Party's headquarters. When he steps outside, he sees a new prisoner who he recognizes. He is then instructed to torture her until she answers his questions. Sayid discovers that the woman is Nadia Andrea Gabriel , a childhood friend. She reveals that she has been tortured before, and nothing Sayid does will persuade her to talk. Omar Navid Negahban , Sayid's friend and superior officer, tells him to execute Nadia. Sayid cuffs Nadia and puts a hood over her head. When he and Nadia are alone he frees her and tells her how to escape. Omar finds them but Sayid fatally shoots him. Nadia thinks that Sayid will have to escape with her now, but he instead shoots himself in the leg and tells her to leave as reinforcements arrive, making it appear as if Nadia shot Sayid and the other officer to escape. On Day 12October 3, 2004Sayid finds a peculiar cable running out of the ocean and into the jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman Mira Furlan cuts him down and ties him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia. The next day, many survivors in the island's camp are stressed, including Sullivan Scott Paulin , who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard Matthew Fox . John Locke Terry O'Quinn and his new hunting companion, Ethan Rom William Mapother , give some newly found luggage to Hurley he looks through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including Kate and Sawyer, arrive to participate. Rousseau asks Sayid about Nadia, and he says that she is dead because of him. Rousseau shows Sayid a broken music box given to her as a gift, and he tells her he can fix it. Rousseau reveals that she was part of a science team, and they were shipwrecked on the island about three days after leaving Tahiti. She identifies the Others as the carriers of a sickness that her companions caught, and says that the Others whisper in the jungle, although she has never seen them. Sayid does not believe her, but continues to fix the music box. After finishing the repairs, much to Rousseau's joy, he asks her to let him go. The duo hear a growl outside, and Rousseau pursues it, leaving Sayid alone. Sayid escapes from Rousseau's bunker while she is gone, grabbing a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him and they have a standoff he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed the firing pin, and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken. The episode was written by David Fury and directed by Greg Yaitanes. According to series co creator Damon Lindelof, discussion of both Solitary and the following episode, Raised by Another , began in September 2004, when Lost debuted on television. The production team had fallen behind schedule, so Fury worked on Solitary while others went to a separate room to discuss Raised by Another , with co creator Carlton Cuse bouncing between the two universes . Although production codes generally go in ascending order, Solitary had production code 107, while Raised by Another had production code 106. This was because, despite the broadcast dates, Raised by Another was written before Solitary . The episodes were edited so that Sayid would return at the end of Raised by Another . Solitary and Raised by Another were the first to orient the series in a weird and mythological direction, according to Lindelof. In Solitary , the series solved its first mystery by revealing the origin of the French voice heard earlier. This reveal occurred despite the network encouraging the producers to wait until the finale to show Rousseau. The episode was the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The producers knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, we were all pretty nervous, in the sense that we all felt we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played. In an early draft of Solitary , Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel. Solitary first aired in the United States on November 17, 2004. An estimated 17.64 million American viewers watched the episode on ABC, a decrease from 18.44 million viewers in the previous episode, Confidence Man . In a review of the episode, Chris Carabott of IGN commented that Rousseau appeared to be more emotionally fragile than in later seasons, and was like a loose cannon . Carabott found that as the series progressed and the mystery around the character was lessened, Rousseau was unable to deliver the same impact she made in her first appearance. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club commended Mira Furlan's performance, writing, an unreliable historian of the island in the best way. Rousseau has been on this island for over sixteen years, and it shows in her ramshackle bunker, her unkempt appearance, and the fact she tortures Sayid for information before even asking him a cursory question about his identity. In a ranking of every episode of Lost excluding the finale for the Los Angeles Times, Emily VanDerWerff ranked Solitary as the show's 45th best episode, and called it underrated. In a similar list, IGN staff ranked the episode as Lost's 51st best, and observed that despite Sayid's dark past, it was hard not to love the character even more after this episode. MTV ranked the episode the 32nd best of the series. Writing for Zap2it in 2008, Ryan McGee said he particularly enjoyed the episode and deemed it one of his top ten favorite episodes that had aired up to that point. McGee explained that Solitary contains a lot of enclosed encounters between two people, set against a gorgeously shot B story that warms the heart.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary%20%28Lost%29
"Sollipulli Spanish pronunciation lit. reddish mountain in the Mapuche language is an ice filled volcanic caldera and volcanic complex, which lies southeast of the small town of Melipeuco in the La Araucania Region, Chile. It is part of the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, one of the four volcanic belts in the Andes chain. The volcano has evolved in close contact with glacial ice. It differs from many calderas in that Sollipulli appears to have collapsed in a non explosive manner. The age of collapse is not yet known, but it is presently filled with ice to thicknesses of 650 m 2,130 ft . The ice drains through two glaciers in the west and the north of the caldera. Sollipulli has developed on a basement formed by Mesozoic and Cenozoic geological formations. Sollipulli was active in the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. A large Plinian eruption occurred 2,9602,780 years before present, forming the Alpehue crater and generating a high eruption column and ignimbrite deposits. The last activity occurred 710 60 years before present and formed the Chufquen scoria cone on the northern flank. Sollipulli is among the 118 volcanoes which have been active in recent history. Sollipulli lies in the Araucania Region, Cautin Province, Melipeuco commune. The Sollipulli volcano is in the western part of the Nevados de Sollipulli mountain range, which is bordered to the north, south and east by river valleys. The communes of Curarrehue, Cunco, Panguipulli, Pucon and Villarrica are in the area, Melipeuco lies 20 km 12 mi northwest. The volcano is also part of the Kutralkura geopark project. Sollipulli is part of the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, one of the four belts of volcanoes which are found in the mountain range. The other three are the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone both north of the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone south of the Southern Volcanic Zone . These volcanic zones are separated by gaps where there is no volcanic activity and the subduction of the Pacific Ocean crust is shallower than in the volcanically active areas. About 60 volcanoes have erupted in historical time in the Andes, and 118 additional volcanic systems show evidence of Holocene eruptions. There are 60 volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone among these are Cerro Azul and Cerro Hudson, which experienced large eruptions in 1932 and 1991 that resulted in the emission of substantial volumes of ash. The volcanoes Llaima and Villarrica have been regularly active during recent history. Sollipulli is a stratovolcano, which has one 4 kilometre wide 2.5 mi caldera on its summit and southwest of it the 1 kilometre wide 0.62 mi Alpehue crater. The crater is draped by pyroclastic flow deposits, and its rim reaches a height of 200 m 660 ft . The rims of the caldera rise 150 m 490 ft above the ice in the caldera the highest summit of Sollipulli lies on the southern flank of the caldera and reaches an elevation of 2,282 m 7,487 ft above sea level. On the southern and eastern side the caldera is bordered by several lava domes. The caldera most likely was not formed by a large explosive eruption, considering that no deposits from such an eruption have been found. The volcano is formed by lava flows, lava domes, scoria, pillow lavas as well as pumice falls, pyroclastics and other material. The edifice has a volume of about 85 km3 20 cu mi and covers a surface area of about 250 km2 97 sq mi . Radial valleys extend away from the top. A number of particular landforms on Sollipulli formed under the influence of glacial ice, such as the caldera structure. The Nevados de Sollipulli mountain chain west of the Sollipulli caldera are a chain of volcanoes which is heavily eroded. They are formed by breccia and lava flows glacial action has left cirques. Closer to the caldera they are better preserved, with individual flows issuing from fissure vents. This chain is one of several eastnortheast striking volcano alignments in the Southern Volcanic Zone, the regional tectonics favour magma ascent along such alignments. The flanks of the volcano are covered by lava flows, which gives them irregular contours. Glaciers and streams have cut valleys into the slopes and smoothed the lava flows. Two scoria cones are situated on the northern flank, Chufquen and Redondo, each associated with lava flows about a dozen such craters dot the flanks of the volcano. Both the main caldera and the Alpehue crater contain glaciers, which in the caldera reached a thickness of 650 m 2,130 ft in 1992 and fills it the total volume was estimated at 6 km3 1.4 cu mi in 1992. These glaciers feature typical ice structures such as crevasses and there may be a subglacial lake in the caldera. Three lakes are found in the caldera at its margins, the easterly Sharkfin lake, the southeasterly Dome lake and the southwesterly Alpehue lake. These glaciers drain to the north and northwest the latter glacier flows from the caldera through the Alpehue crater into the valley of the same name, which is drained by the Rio Alpehue into the Rio Allipen river. Other than the caldera and crater glaciers, the only snow cover on Sollipulli is seasonal. The glacier within the caldera of Sollipulli is shrinking its surface area decreased between 1961 and 2011 and the Alpehuen outlet glacier retreated by 1.3 km 0.81 mi . The process of glacier retreat is probably accelerated by ash being deposited on the glacier through eruptions at the neighbouring volcano Puyehue Cordon Caulle activity at the other volcanoes Llaima and Villarrica may have the same effect. In 2011, the volume of the glacier was 4.5 0.5 km3 1.08 0.12 cu mi . Melting of the glacier risks generating lahars and putting water supplies in the region into jeopardy. Nevados de Solipulli seen from Villarrica volcano Sollipulli caldera viewed from space, east is up The caldera glacier of Sollipulli Subduction has been ongoing on the western side of South America since 185 million years ago and has resulted in the formation of the Andes and volcanic activity within the range. About 27 million years ago, the Farallon Plate broke up and the pace of subduction increased, resulting in increased volcanic activity and a temporary change in the tectonic regime of the Southern Andes. Sollipulli volcano developed on a 600 to 1,600 metre high 2,0005,200 ft basement which consists of the JurassicCretaceous Nacientes del Biobio formation and the Pliocene Pleistocene Nevados de Sollipulli volcanics, with subordinate exposures of the Miocene Curamallin and the Cretaceous Tertiary Vizcacha Cumilao complex volcano sedimentary formations. Miocene granites are intruded into the basement. Rocks erupted from Sollipulli range from basalt over basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite. Composition has changed over the evolution of the volcano sometimes one type of rock is found as inclusion in another. Minerals contained in the rocks include apatite, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite. Xenoliths are also found, including diorite and granophyre. The petrogenesis of the Alpehue rocks has been explained with the penetration of more primitive magma into a dacitic magma chamber, which was then subject to magma mixing. The primitive magmas sometimes pass through the flanks of the edifice and form parasitic vents in these cases. Obsidian was obtained on Sollipulli and exported over large distances it has been found as far as Argentina's steppes and northern Chile, and is chemically and in appearance different from obsidian obtained on Chaiten volcano. One source has been identified at a lava dome on the western side of Sollipulli. A route starting south of Melipeuco leads up on the volcano this route was used for the transport of obsidian in the 1980s. The region is forested, with deciduous trees including Nothofagus, with laurel forests around the lakes of the area and woods consisting of Araucaria araucana and Austrocedrus chilensis at altitudes exceeding 800 m 2,600 ft . In addition there are open grasslands called mallines which were used for grazing. Sollipulli was active during the Pleistocene and Holocene the Nevados de Sollipulli are less than 1.8 million years old with argon argon dating having obtained ages of 490,000 30,000 and 312,000 20,000 years ago. Six separate volcanic units form the edifice from the oldest to the youngest they are the Sharkfin, Northwest, South, Peak, Alpehue and Chufquen units. The first two may be contemporaneous to the formation of the caldera, or they may predate it. The Sharkfin unit was emplaced in a subglacial environment and later disrupted by faulting, later units show substantial evidence of having been altered by glaciers. Radiometric dates have been obtained on the Sharkfin unit 700,000 140,000 and 350,000 90,000 years before present , the Northwest unit 120,000 16,000, 120,000 140,000, 110,000 30,000 and 100,000 30,000 years before present and the South and Peak units 68,000 14,000, 64,000 15,000 and 26,000 5,000 years before present . The caldera is nested within an older and eroded caldera, and some parasitic cones are heavily eroded whereas others appear to be younger. Pyroclastic flows from Alpehue have been dated to 2,9602,780 years before present. The Alpehue unit was emplaced during a large Plinian eruption, which generated a 44 kilometre high 27 mi eruption column and ejected about 7.5 km3 1.8 cu mi of pumice falls layers of tephra identified in a bog of South Georgia 3,000 km 1,900 mi away as well as in an ice core at Siple Dome in Antarctica and dated to about 980 BCE may be a product of the Alpehue eruption. Alpehue tephra has been used as a tephrochronology tool. Pyroclastic flows from the eruption melted the caldera ice sheet, forming lahars that propagated northwest away from Sollipulli. Ignimbrites from this eruption cover surfaces of at least 40 km2 15 sq mi around Sollipulli, their volume has been estimated to be about 0.4 km3 0.096 cu mi . They are brown to grey in colour and unwelded with the exception of part of the ignimbrite that is emplaced within the Alpehue crater. The eruption reached a level of 5 on the volcanic explosivity index. Radiocarbon dating at Chufquen has yielded an age of 710 60 years before present. This eruption deposited ash onto the caldera ice, while it is absent from the central parts of the Chufquen valley either it was removed by a later glacier advance or it landed on a glacier which later retreated. The eruption occurred relatively recently, indicating that Sollipulli is still active. The substantial ice body in the caldera means that there is a significant risk of mudflows or glacier bursts in the case of renewed activity. A repeat of the Alpehue eruption would be a regional catastrophe, comparable to the 1991 eruption of Cerro Hudson volcano. The Chilean geological service Sernageomin monitors the volcano and publishes a hazard index for it. The towns of Cunco, Melipeuco and Villa Garcia are close to the volcano.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sollipulli
"Solo is a James Bond continuation novel written by William Boyd. It was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 26 September 2013 in hardback, e book and audio editions, and in the US by HarperCollins on 8 October 2013. The plot centres on Bond's mission to the civil war in the fictional country of Zanzarina thinly veiled version of Biafra during the Nigerian Civil Warwhere he meets the local MI6 contact, Efua Blessing Ogilvy Grant, and a Rhodesian mercenary, Kobus Breed. After being shot by Ogilvy Grant, Bond tracks both people to Washington on a revenge mission, finally establishing that Breed is trafficking heroin into the US. Boyd closely based his version of the Bond character on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed any of the film versions. The novel is set in 1969six years after Fleming's last work was setand Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria and used his experiences during the civil war to provide the location for the novel. He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing the novel he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write the novel, with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond. Solo received mixed reviews, with a number of critics pointing to the convoluted and unstirring plot. Other critics saw the book as being equal with, or superior to, Fleming's stronger novels. The book sold well, appearing in the top ten selling book lists in the UK. After celebrating his 45th birthday alone at The Dorchester, Bond is sent to Zanzarim to bring a speedy end to the civil war in the country which has seen the delta region of the country split to form the Democratic Republic of Dahum. Before leaving for Africa, Bond visits Gabriel Adekathe rebel leader's brotherwho runs AfricaKIN, a London based charity who send aid to Dahumni children Gabriel tells Bond that he is not in contact with his brother Solomon, as the pair have fallen out. On his arrival in Zanzarim, Bond is aided by a local agent who introduces herself as Efua Blessing Ogilvy Grant. The two travel from the capital city to the rebel enclave, but are attacked shortly before reaching their destination and taken captive by Kobus Breed, a mercenary assisting the rebels. The group are attacked on their return journey and Ogilvy Grant goes missing in the confusion, while Bond escapes. Bond proceeds to the enclave, where he is met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment coming into the country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck the aeroplanes all show the AfricaKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries to leave the country on one of the supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die. Bond is saved by a journalist he befriended and returns to the UK, where he spends time in a military hospital. After discharging himself, he decides to go on a revenge mission against Breed and Ogilvy Grant. Discovering AfricaKIN has relocated to Washington DC, Bond travels to the US and tracks down both of them at the AfricaKIN offices. While conducting surveillance against the company, Bond is briefly detained by Brigham Leiternephew of Felixof the CIA, who explains Ogilvy Grant also works for the CIA. Bond meets Ogilvy Grant, who assures him that she shot to wound him in order that Breed would not shoot them both. The following day Bond watches a mercy flight bringing in maimed and injured Zanzarimi children he dines alone and returns to his hotel to find that Breed has killed Ogilvy Grant. Bond attacks the house where Breed is staying with the children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He establishes that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin into the country and locates Solomon Adeka, who had not been killed in Africa, but been turned into a heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house. The central character of the novel is James Bond, the fictional MI6 agent created by Ian Fleming. The author, William Boyd modelled his version of the character on Fleming's version, which Boyd identified as being very different from the version seen in the films. Solo is set in 1969six years after Fleming's last work was setand the novel begins with Bond celebrating his 45th birthday. Boyd altered aspects of the character, making him an older, wiser Bond ' while having coffee on the King's Road, Bond's advancing age lends an undertone of poignancy to his almost detached observation of the bra less, mini skirted cavalcade . Boyd's version of Bond is more impulsive, less emotionally guarded, and also more sadistic than Fleming's, and he has the facility for extreme violence. According to The Sunday Times, Bond's casual sexism has gone, to be replaced by a flaring lust that teeters on the edge of being out of control, and has to be reined in . The primary antagonist of the novel is Kobus Breed, a mercenary with a disfigured face and a permanently weeping eye who had previously served with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland Olen Steinhauer, writing in The New York Times thinks the scarred villain to be an obligatory nod toward the requirements of the Bond formula . Some writers are unimpressed with Breed Robert Crampton of The Sunday Times thinks that the character feels more like a henchman than a proper power crazed villain. He has menace, but no ambition. You wait for the evil genius to turn upbut he never does , while David Sexton in the London Evening Standard thinks the character lacks charisma , and David Connett in the Sunday Express considers him a colourless character in comparison with factual and fictional counterparts . The journalist Geoffrey Wansell in the Daily Mail disagreed and Breed, along with a second villain, millionaire Hulbert Linck, were as strong as some of Fleming's villains Steinhauer also thought that the novel's villains were realistic, motivated by simple greed yet clever enough to be legitimately dangerous . There are two main female characters in Soloa horror film actress, Bryce Fitzjohn and the local MI6 contact Efua Blessing Ogilvy Grant rather like many of Fleming's female characters, both are determined females who are not to be patronised by Bond . The main theme of the novel is revenge. Bond is stopped from leaving Zanzarim by Breed and subsequently shot and badly wounded by Ogilvy Grant he tracks down the pair to Washington and attempts to get his revenge. According to The Sunday Business Post, this is where the author comes into his own, along with our hero, and it's all taken up a notch. Associated with the revenge is treachery it is a subject that recurred through Fleming's works, and Boyd uses it to provide a motive for Bond's mission of revenge. On 31 March 2012 Boyd announced at the Oxford Literary Festival that he was working on a novel set in Africa. Boyd had lived in Nigeria where his mother was a teacher and his father a doctor during the Nigerian Civil War, which had a profound effect on him. On 11 April 2012 the Fleming estate announced that Boyd would write a Bond novel to follow Jeffery Deaver's 2011 novel Carte Blanche. The civil war, over the attempted secession by Biafra from Nigeria, was the location for Solo, although Boyd renamed this as the fictional Zanzarim. On 15 April 2013 Boyd announced the book's title at the London Book Fair. The announcement was part of the Author of the Day event at the English Pen Literary Cafe. Selected press were invited to the event and were given a brief opportunity to question Boyd about the book's title. Boyd believes the short title is strikingly apt for the novel. He remarked that titles are very important to him, and that as soon as he wrote down Solo on a sheet of paper I saw its potential. Not only did it fit the theme of the novel perfectly, it's also a great punchy word, instantly and internationally comprehensible, graphically alluring and, as an extra bonus, it's strangely Bondian in the sense that we might be subliminally aware of the '00' of '007' lurking just behind those juxtaposed O's of SOLO . For background Boyd read all the Bond stories in chronological order and had researched Fleming and the literary Bond's background. Boyd was a child when his father introduced him to Fleming's works. As a result, Boyd found himself also becoming fascinated with Ian Fleming. He told reporters that he was interested in Bond as a human being. Bond is not just a superhero. He has flaws, he has weaknesses, he makes mistakes. ... That was Fleming's genius. The novel is set in 1969 when Bond is 45 Boyd intentionally picked the year, further adding that there are no gimmicks, it's a real spy story. Boyd criticised how the filmmakers have portrayed Bond onscreen as a cartoon character he also believes that Bond should be troubled and a massive boozer. The novel reflects Boyd's view, where Bond drinks enough to float a boat. He drinks so much you wonder that he ever has the time or inclination to do anything else . The writing process took 18 months and Boyd was required to run synopses and drafts through the Fleming estate, a process he described as benevolent surveillance . The process was not always smooth, and the author had a number of arguments with the estate over the portrayal of Bond they were concerned about Bond being seen as an assassin, but I would argue Bond is sent on an assassination mission in at least four Fleming books , with further issues over Bond's relationship with M. Boyd described writing the book as tremendous fun and a once in a lifetime challenge , but admitted that he had to take it really, really seriously. After completing the writing process, Boyd commented that he did not attempt to write a pastiche Fleming novel ... it's my own voice I'm dealing with things and subjects I am interested in ... it is very much my novel it just features these characters invented by Fleming. Solo was launched on 25 September 2013 at the Dorchester Hotel. Seven copies of the book were signed by Boyd, were collected by seven Jensen Interceptors and were then flown by British Airways to Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Zurich, Los Angeles, Delhi, Cape Town and Sydney. The book was released into the shops on 26 September 2013 the hardcover book was published by Jonathan Cape and was 336 pages long and cost 18.99. An e book edition was also released, as was an audio book, narrated by Dominic West. The hardcover edition was released in the US by HarperCollins on 8 October 2013 for 26.99. The jacket was designed by Suzanne Dean, the creative director at Random House. The book's dust jacket featured die cut bullet holes, while the hardcover binding featured burn marks under the holes. Dean commented that she took inspiration from the 1960s in her design, and was influenced by the graphic designers Saul Bass, Paul Rand and Alvin Lustig. The novel sold nearly 9,000 copies in its first week, although that was 48 down on Deaver's Carte Blanche, and even further behind Sebastian Faulks's 2008 book Devil May Care. By 10 October the London Evening Standard listed the books as number one on the London's Bestsellers list, and in the two weeks of 5 and 12 October 2013 was shown as number 3 in the UK fiction best sellers list, dropping to fourth place on 19 October 2013. Solo received mixed reviews. A number of reviewers, including Robert McCrum in The Guardian, David Mills in The Sunday Times and Olen Steinhauer in The New York Times, all consider the book to be equal with, or superior to, Fleming's stronger novels. Steinhauer writes that it was Boyd's description of the Zanzarim civil war that gave the novel its greatest power , and that Boyd performs a neat metafictional trick by connecting Bond's wartime experiences with 30 Assault Unita British Commando unit developed by Fleming. The connection was also picked up by Geoffrey Wansell, reviewing for the Daily Mail, who saw the tribute paid to Fleming as a masterstroke , in a novel that he thought brings back the real Bond, triumphantly . Writing in The Guardian, Richard Williams saw Boyd using some similar phrasing of Fleming's, while also including gestures of independence with his own ideas. The result, Williams believes, is a story that entertains far more than it exasperates . Much of the criticism about the novel focuses on the plot Jon Stock, writing in The Daily Telegraph, thought that although Boyd used details in the same way Fleming did that would appeal to Bond aficionados, the book was based on a curiously unstirring plot , which was also convoluted . The National's Nick Leech also noted the use of details, but considered that this led to a pedantic, meandering narrative which led to an underwhelming finale . Writing in the London Evening Standard, David Sexton agreed, calling the book a rather inattentive novel , that was a lame outing in the Bond canon. David Connett was another who saw flaws in the novel, calling it anaemic stuff , although it was far superior to the last effort to breathe life into a Bond novel by Jeffery Deaver . On 30 September 2013 Solo was the chosen work for Book at Bedtime on BBC Radio 4. The work was read by Paterson Joseph the book was adapted by Libby Spurrier and was broadcast in ten episodes.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo%20%28Boyd%20novel%29
"Solo is a studio album by Cuban jazz performer Gonzalo Rubalcaba. It was released by Blue Note Records on March 7, 2006, and peaked at number 22 in the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart. The album is titled Solo since no additional performers were included on the recording as in Rubalcaba's previous albums. Also produced by Rubalcaba, Solo was released following his second collaborative work with Charlie Haden on the album Land of the Sun, which resulted in a Grammy Award for Haden. The album includes fifteen tracks and met with mostly positive reviews by critics, most commenting on the ability of the performer and the simplicity of the arrangements. The album was nominated for a Billboard Latin Music Award, and won the Latin Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album. Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba recorded Solo following his collaboration with Charlie Haden on Land of the Sun, an album featuring songs written by Mexican composer Jose Sabre Marroquin and arranged by Rubalcaba, a sequel to Nocturne 2001 , another collaboration between them. Haden and Rubalcaba were awarded the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album for both albums. Solo was the first solo album not featuring guest musicians released by the performer in twenty years. Rubalcaba described this album as an aural diary, an album of secrets, letters and notes, and photos. The album was released by Blue Note Records on March 7, 2006. Solo includes fifteen tracks, some previously released. Recording sessions took place from November 8 to 10, 2005, at The Hit Factory and Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. There are four improvised tracks inspired by John Coltrane's Giant Steps Paseo Iluminado , Paseo en Media Luz , Paseo Azul , and Paseo Morado . Iluminado Improv 1 , according to Roberto R. Calder of PopMatters, has stock phrasing, but a pause in concentration before the sublime quality of a one minute lullaby worth waiting for Media Luz Improv 2 hints at jazz with concert room sonorities and a striking ending Azul Improv 3 proceeds with more consistent direction than its two predecessors and becomes a hymn and Morado Improv 4 develops into long linear passages for each hand. Faro is a track with a simple ostinato bass, a transition section and a loud climax. The opening track, Rezo , is an interlude inspired by the work of French composer Claude Debussy and American performer Duke Ellington, and is based on Afro Cuban melodies sung during Santeria rites. Silencio is a tribute to Cuban boleros. Prologo Prologue to a Fantasy features a congenial intellectual playfulness alternating between something like Spanish piano music of a century ago, and the dance hall. Besame Mucho was first included on the 1991 album The Blessing, Rubalcaba's first recording to be issued in the United States, and the version was named by Scott Yanow of AllMusic a highlight of the album, including accompaniment from Haden on bass guitar and drummer Jack DeJohnette. A reworked version is included on Solo, and is described as having an intensely meditative character and slow deliberation, and a more complex higher level of communication than the original version. Here's That Rainy Day is a jazz ballad, recorded earlier for the album Inner Voyage, with an arrangement described as breathtaking by Ken Dryden of Allmusic. The first version of Quasar can be found on Paseo 2004 and the version included on Solo is described as seven minutes of drama, by Calder of PopMatters, with a sprawling, improv heavy composition that runs Rubalcaba up and down the keyboard. Solo received mostly positive reviews from critics. Andrew Liengard of Jazz Houston stated that Rubalcaba played at once a pyrotechnical and thunderous two handed assault, he also demonstrates a profound awareness of space and dynamics, and finally called the album stunning . Joey Guerra of Amazon said that Solo finds Rubalcaba soaring on the strength of his own talent , creating a unique experience. Website AllMusic stated that the album is a spellbinding collection of improvisations with remarkable stylistic display. Harvey Siders of JazzTimes commented that the album did not need elaborate arrangements, being a spontaneous inner dialogue from a brilliant inquisitive mind and that on Solo elegance trumps excitement. PopMatters' Robert R. Calder stated that the record was a very remarkable solo piano recital. David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work. Miller also suggested that Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings. He still has time to become a great solo artist, and this writer has every confidence that he will. In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait for this moment, and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately he lights an inspiring fire. Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdes, asseverating that both performers blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction. Timothy Sprinkle of Jazz Review declared that the performer carries the disc with a light, breezy ease that's surprising, especially given all of the slow selections. Solo peaked at number 22 in the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart and was nominated for Latin Jazz Album of the Year at the 18th Annual Billboard Latin Music Awards, losing to Around the City by Eliane Elias. Rubalcaba earned the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album at the 7th Latin Grammy Awards for Solo. The track listing is from AllMusic. All tracks written and composed by Gonzalo Rubalcaba, except Nightfall by Charlie Haden Besame Mucho by Consuelo Velazquez and Here's That Rainy Day by Johnny Burke and James Van Heusen.

"Hope Amelia Solo born July 30, 1981 is an American former soccer goalkeeper. She was a goalkeeper for the United States women's national soccer team from 2000 to 2016, and is a World Cup champion and two time Olympic gold medalist. After playing at the collegiate level for the University of Washington, she played professionally for the Philadelphia Charge in the Women's United Soccer Association WUSA . When the WUSA folded after her first season, she traveled to Europe to play for the top division leagues in Sweden and France. From 2009 to 2011, she played in the Women's Professional Soccer WPS for Saint Louis Athletica, Atlanta Beat and MagicJack. After the WPS ceased operations in early 2012, she played for the Seattle Sounders in the W League. She most recently played for Seattle Reign FC in the National Women's Soccer League, the top division of women's soccer in the United States. Solo is regarded as one of the top female goalkeepers in the world and currently holds the U.S. record for most career clean sheets. She was the starting goalkeeper for the majority of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and helped lead the U.S. national team to the semifinals having given up only two goals in four games, including three consecutive shutouts. After a controversial move made by head coach Greg Ryan to bench Solo in favor of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry for the semifinal, in which the United States was defeated 40 by Brazil, Solo made headlines with post game remarks that resulted in many teammates shunning her. She later rebounded to help the United States win gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. During the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, her exceptional skill was highlighted especially during a quarter final match against Brazil, which the U.S. won on penalty kicks. Although the team lost to Japan in a match that ended in penalties, Solo received the Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper as well as the Bronze Ball award for her overall performance at the tournament. Following her performance at the 2011 World Cup, Solo participated in the television show Dancing with the Stars and posed for various magazines, most notably the Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine. After the 2012 London Olympics, where she received her second Olympic gold medal, she published her bestselling autobiography Solo A Memoir of Hope. As the starting goalkeeper at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Solo helped the U.S. win the national team's third World Cup championship since 1991. The final was the most watched televised soccer game ever in the United States. As of August 6, 2016 , Solo holds several U.S. goalkeeper records including appearances 202 , starts 190 , wins 153 , shutouts 102 , wins in a season 26 , consecutive minutes played 1,256 , and longest undefeated streak 55 games . Solo was born in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn nee Shaw and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian American Vietnam War veteran, who was in and out of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a baseball game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007. As a forward at Richland High School, Solo scored 109 goals, leading her team to three consecutive league titles from 1996 to 1998 and a state championship during her senior year. She was twice named a Parade All American. Solo also played club soccer for the Three Rivers Soccer Club in the Tri Cities. After being heavily recruited by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under the lead of head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that my job was to save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhoodresilience and toughnesswere assets at the position. Solo became the top goalkeeper in Pac 10 history and finished her collegiate career as Washingtons all time leader in shutouts 18 , saves 325 and goals against average GAA 1.02 . She was a four time All Pac 10 selection and was named an NSCAA All American as a sophomore, junior and senior. During her sophomore year, Solo was named Pac 10 Player of the Year becoming the first Washingtonian and first goalkeeper ever to receive the award. As a senior, she was the only goalkeeper nominated for the Hermann Trophy. Following her college career, Solo was selected in the first round fourth overall of the 2003 WUSA Draft by the Philadelphia Charge. She spent most of her first professional season on the bench playing in eight games. Solo started the last three games of the season and earned her first professional shutout against the Atlanta Beat. She also shut out eventual league champions, the Washington Freedom led by top scorers, Mia Hamm and Abby Wambach. After the WUSA folded following the 2003 season just six days before the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, Solo moved to Goteborg, Sweden in February 2004 to play for Kopparbergs Goteborg FC in the Swedish Premier Division, the top division of women's soccer in Sweden. For ten months, she played in two games a week, making 19 appearances in goal for Goteborg in 2004. In 2005, she played for Olympique Lyonnais in the French First Division. She made seven appearances for the French club. Solo said of her experience in Europe, I played in Europe and it was a great experience, not just because of my teammates and the coaches we had, but from the fans and the city itself I played in Gothenburg and I played in Lyon and soccer was everywhere. At that time in my life, it really jump started my career and really helped me find myself as a person and player. On September 16, 2008, Solo was one of three national team players allocated to the Saint Louis Athletica in the WPS as part of the 2008 WPS Player Allocation, with the new league slated to begin play in April 2009. Solo let in six goals in the first four games as Athletica got off to a very slow 022 start in their first season. She conceded eight goals in her next 13 games and finished the season with eight shutouts, helping lead the Athletica from the bottom of the standings to finish second place and secure a playoff spot. After the 2009 season, Solo was named the WPS Goalkeeper of the Year. She also became the first goalkeeper to be named U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year, the highest honor awarded to a soccer player in the United States. In May 2010, the Saint Louis Athletica folded and Solo signed with WPS expansion team, Atlanta Beat, along with her St. Louis teammates, Tina Ellertson and Eniola Aluko. As her previous jersey number was taken 1 , she wore 78 for the Beat. Solo's comments on social networking website Twitter led to two separate controversies after she accused Boston Breakers supporters of offensive chanting and racist remarks toward a teammate, then questioned the integrity of match officials and the league itself following the Beat's 10 defeat to Washington Freedom. The second outburst resulted in a 2,500 fine and one game suspension. Solo played in 22 WPS matches in 2010 for both the Athletica and the Beat and was the league leader in saves with 104. The two time WPS All Star also ranked among the top three in shutouts 6 , wins 6 , and goals against average 1.64 . After the end of the 2010 season, Solo underwent surgery on her right shoulder on September 22. These next two years are huge for the national team with the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon and I wanted to make sure that I would be giving my team and my country my best on the field, Solo said of the surgery. I've been having some painful issues with the shoulder for a while and for a goalkeeper it's been difficult physically and mentally to play with this kind of an injury, so it was time to get it taken care of. Ahead of the 2011 Women's Professional Soccer season, Solo signed for MagicJack, formerly the Washington Freedom under new ownership. Between her shoulder surgery recovery, national team commitments and preparation for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, Solo missed a significant part of the season. She made four appearances for the club, tallying a total of 360 minutes. After the season ended, the club lost its franchise on October 25, 2011. The league later suspended operations in early 2012 because of legal and financial difficulties. On February 14, 2012, it was announced that Solo had signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. Joining the club the same year were national teammates Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, and Sydney Leroux. Sounders Women general manager, Amy Carnell, said of the signing, Hope is undoubtedly the best women's keeper in the game today. Her signing represents the caliber player Sounders Women's fans can expect in 2012. As the landscape of women's soccer continues to evolve, we realize the unique opportunity before us. Because of national team commitments and preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Solo made three appearances for the club, tallying a total of 261 minutes. Her goals against average was 0.344, she made five saves and had one shutout. With the addition of Solo and her national team teammates, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at Starfire Stadium capacity 4,500 . The average attendance during league matches was four times higher than the second most attended team in the league. On January 19, 2013 it was announced that Solo was one of three members from the United States national team, along with Megan Rapinoe and Amy Rodriguez, allocated to the Seattle Reign FC for the inaugural season of the National Women's Soccer League, as part of the NWSL Player Allocation. Two months later, it was reported that she was undergoing wrist surgery and would miss about half the season because of recovery. Joining news that Amy Rodriguez would be out for the season because of pregnancy and Megan Rapinoe would be returning mid season after a six month stint for Olympique Lyonnais, the Reign faced a tough first half of the season and went 091 in their first ten games. With the return of Solo, Rapinoe, and some additional lineup changes made during the early summer, the Reign turned their regular season record around and finished the season in seventh place with a 5143 record. Solo started in all 14 matches in which she played with a 1.357 goals against average. She made 81 saves and tallied 1,260 minutes in goal. In October 2013 Solo was linked with a transfer to English club Manchester City. Despite the relatively high salary reportedly offered by Manchester, Reign FC coach Laura Harvey expected Solo to return to the NWSL for 2014, to safeguard her place in the national team. Solo returned to the Reign for the 2014 season. The team set a league record unbeaten streak of 16 games during the first part of the season. During the 16 game stretch, the Reign compiled a 1303 record. The Reign finished first in the regular season clinching the NWSL Shield for the first time. After defeating the Washington Spirit 21 in the playoff semi finals, the Reign were defeated 21 by FC Kansas City during the championship final. Following the regular season, Solo and Reign defenders Lauren Barnes and Stephanie Cox were named to the Second XI team. Solo finished the 2014 season with 65 saves in 20 games played and a .900 goals against average. Solo made eight appearances for Seattle during the 2016 season before joining the national team at the 2016 Rio Olympics. After US Soccer suspended Solo and terminated her national team contract in August 2016 for saying that the Sweden women's national football team played like cowards, she was granted personal leave by the Reign for the remainder of the NWSL season. She finished the season with a 0.63 GAA and 81 save percentage, including five clean sheets. Solo played for U.S. junior national soccer teams before joining the senior U.S. national team in 2000. Her senior debut came in an 80 win over Iceland at Davidson, North Carolina in April 2000. In 2004, Solo joined the national team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens as an alternate behind primary goalkeeper Briana Scurry and backup Kristin Luckenbill. Solo has been the team's first choice goalkeeper since 2005. She holds the national team record for longest undefeated streak as a goalkeeper with 55 games from March 7, 2002 to July 16, 2008. Solo was the starting goalkeeper for the United States in the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, giving up two goals in four games including consecutive shutouts of Sweden, Nigeria and England. Heading into the semifinal match against Brazil, U.S. coach Greg Ryan benched Solo in favor of 36 year old veteran U.S. keeper Briana Scurry, who had a strong history of performance against the Brazilians but had not played a complete game in three months. The U.S. lost to Brazil 40, ending a 51game regulation time undefeated streak, while playing much of the match with only 10 players after midfielder Shannon Boxx was sent off after receiving two yellow cards in the first half. In an impromptu interview following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. It was the wrong decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's no doubt in my mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think. Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 41. Solo was named to the U.S. women's national soccer team roster for the post World Cup tour, but did not attend the first workout ahead of the first game against Mexico. Even though the players' contract with the federation stipulated that anyone on the World Cup roster had the right to play in the tour, she did not play in any of the three games against Mexico, being replaced by Briana Scurry for the first and third matches, and Nicole Barnhart for the second. The third match against Mexico, on October 20, 2007, marked the end of the U.S. women's national team's 2007 season. The team regrouped in January 2008 to begin preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Ryan left the team after his contract was not renewed in December 2007. On June 23, 2008, it was announced Solo would be the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In a reversal of roles from the 2004 Olympics, Briana Scurry did not make the team, though she was an alternate. On August 21, the U.S. women's team won the gold medal by defeating Brazil 10 in extra time, in no small measure due to Solo's performance as she stopped an energetic Brazilian attack, making save after save. After the team won gold, Solo appeared on NBC Today Show, and she stated in a 2012 article appearing in ESPN The Magazine that she was drunk while on air. When we were done partying, we got out of our dresses, got back into our stadium coats and, at 7 a.m. with no sleep, went on the Today show drunk. Despite missing much of the qualifying campaign with a shoulder injury, Solo was named to the U.S. roster for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany. After keeping clean sheets in group C wins over North Korea and Colombia, Solo conceded two goals in the 21 loss to Sweden which consigned the Americans to second place in the group and a quarterfinal meeting with Brazil. The quarterfinal match between the U.S. and Brazil was sent into a penalty shoot out after U.S. forward Abby Wambach tied the game at 22 in stoppage time at the end of extra time. Solo saved the third Brazil penalty kick by Daiane, helping the U.S. secure a semifinal spot against France. After the quarterfinal victory, Solo commented on the performance and spirit of the U.S. players during the match, Even when we were a player down and a goal behind in extra time, you sensed that something was going to happen , and added that team kept fighting. You can't teach that. It's a feeling and we play with that feeling. Solo became the twenty seventh American woman and second goalkeeper to reach 100 caps with her start in the 31 semifinal win over France. Talking to the media after the match, Solo reflected upon the tournament so far, It was a hard fought road ... It hasn't been easy, but this is where we expected to be. We came this far, we better go all the way. In the final, the U.S. team lost 31 in a penalty shootout to Japan, after twice taking the lead in an eventual 22 draw. Solo expressed admiration for the Japanese team and offered her congratulations. Solo won the Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper, and the Bronze Ball award for her overall performance. She was also featured in the All star team of the tournament. Leading up to the Summer Olympics, Solo received a public warning from the U.S. Anti Doping Agency USADA after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance canrenone had been detected. Solo said in a statement she had been prescribed a pre menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre Olympic matches. In a 42 defeat of France in the opening match, France took an early 20 lead in 15 minutes. After Abby Wambach reduced the lead to 21 with a 19th minute header off a Megan Rapinoe corner kick, Solo assisted Alex Morgan at the 32nd minute to score and level the match at 22 she took a free kick sending the ball to Morgan, who kicked the ball after a bounce, over goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi into the goal. On August 9, Solo won her second Olympic gold medal with the United States women's national soccer team. In a 21 defeat of Japan in the final match, Solo made many saves, including an 82nd minute save of a shot from Mana Iwabuchi, which could have tied the match. Solo kept three clean sheets, two in group stage against Colombia with 30 and Korea DPR with 10, and a 20 win against New Zealand in the quarter final. She conceded 6 goals, 3 in the aforementioned matches against France and Japan. Three goals were conceded to Christine Sinclair in the semi final, a 43 extra time last minute win against Canada. Along with defenders Christie Rampone and Kelley O'Hara, Solo was one of three players on the United States team who played all 570 minutes during the team's six matches. In March 2013, Solo underwent surgery to repair a long standing injury in her left wrist and did not play for approximately three months. She returned to the national team in June. The team finished 2013 undefeated with a 1303 record. On June 14, 2014, Solo tied the U.S. record for career shutouts with 71 after the team defeated France 10 during a friendly match in Tampa, Florida. The record was previously set by retired goalkeeper, Briana Scurry. A few months later on September 13, she set a new record with her 72nd shutout in a friendly match against Mexico that resulted in an 80 win for the United States. On January 21, 2015, Solo was suspended by the national team for thirty days, due to an undisclosed incident at a training camp. In April 2015, Solo was named to the U.S. roster for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada by head coach Jill Ellis. Solo started and played all possible minutes 630 in all seven of the U.S.' matches, and the U.S. won the tournament, with record breaking television viewership that topped 750 million in home TV viewers. After giving up a goal in the 27th minute of the team's first group stage match against Australia, Solo made three crucial saves in the same match that kept her team in the game . Her performance earned praise from her teammates and coach. She had a 540 minute shutout streak, the second longest in tournament history, and allowed three goals throughout the tournament. During the semi final match against top ranked Germany, she used stalling tactics to try to put the tournament's high scorer, Celia Sasic, off her rhythm at a penalty kick. Sasic missed the penalty kick, which kept the game scoreless. This marked the first time a German team, men's or women's, missed a penalty in a World Cup. She ended the tournament with 177 international caps and received the Golden Glove trophy as the best goalkeeper. On July 9, 2016, Hope Solo earned her 100th international shutout, 150th career win, and 197th cap in a friendly game against South Africa at Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois. This made Solo the first ever female goalkeeper in history to achieve 100 shutouts in international competition. On the occasion of her 200th cap, Solo made several fine saves as the United States beat France 10, to follow up their opening 20 win over New Zealand. In the final group fixture against Colombia, Solo made two errors which allowed their lowly ranked opponents to secure a 22 draw. During the United States' matches Solo had been jeered by the Brazilian crowds, who also chanted Zika at her when she touched the ball, in response to her pre tournament contributions to the 201516 Zika virus epidemic debate. Solo attracted more controversy in the United States' quarter final defeat by Sweden. During the penalty shootout she caused an interruption of several minutes when changing her gloves before Sweden's final kick, in an apparent act of gamesmanship. Lisa Dahlkvist was seen to laugh at Solo's antics, before converting the penalty to eliminate the United States. Following the match Solo called her opponents a bunch of cowards in reference to their ultra defensive tactics. The remark was made to Grant Wahl in the raw aftermath of the defeat. The International Olympic Committee called Solo's comments disappointing but said she was unlikely to face formal disciplinary action adding People are free to say those things. We wouldnt stop their right to express themselves, within boundaries, obviously. Swedish coach Pia Sundhage was more blunt in her assessment I don't give a crap. I'm going to Rio, she's going home and later said, I think she was just stressed, and that she did not really mean it. Swedish players, Lotta Schelin, Lisa Dahlkvist and Kosovare Asllani voiced their empathy for Solo chalking her comment up to being caught up in the heat of the moment. Hope Solo On August 24, 2016, US Soccer suspended Solo for six months and terminated her national team contract, making it her second suspension from the USWNT. The governing body said that Solo's previous misconduct had influenced its decision. Solo reacted angrily, saying that her comments had been used as a pretext to force her out, due to her prominent role in the national team's campaign for equal pay. Teammate Megan Rapinoe speculated that Solo's termination was probably some legal strategy on the part of US Soccer. In announcing a legal challenge to US Soccer's action, the players' lawyer Rich Nichols termed it excessive, unprecedented, disproportionate, and a violation of Ms. Solos First Amendment rights. Solo is married to former American football player Jerramy Stevens. They have been together since mid August 2012 when Solo returned from the Olympics. On November 12, 2012, Stevens was arrested on investigation of assault following an altercation that left Solo injured. The following day, Stevens was released after a judge determined there was not enough evidence to hold him. The couple were wed the next day. In 2014, Solo was one of the victims of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, during which several nude pictures of her were leaked online. She expressed solidarity with the other women affected and criticized the perpetrators This act goes beyond the bounds of human decency . On June 21, 2014, Solo was arrested and charged with two misdemeanor counts of assault in the fourth degree one against her half sister and the other against her nephew. She was booked under her married name of Hope Amelia Stevens. After pleading not guilty, she was released the following day. In August, her trial was scheduled for November 4, 2014, but this was later delayed until January 20, 2015. On December 30, 2014, the judge ordered more depositions from the defendants and delayed a decision on whether charges against Solo would be dropped until January 6, 2015. Following her arrest, Solo sat out one game for the Reign and the NWSL allowed her to continue playing soccer through the end of the 2014 season. There was some debate in the media about whether this exemplified a double standard in professional American sports after pro football players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson had been suspended by the National Football League after Rice was shown in a previously undisclosed video assaulting his wife in a hotel elevator and Peterson was indicted by a grand jury on a felony charge of child abuse. Senator Richard Blumenthal D Conn. sent out a sternly worded letter to U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati admonishing the organization for allowing Solo to remain on the World Cup roster following her arrest and accused them of inadequately addressing the charges of domestic violence. On January 13, 2015, the judge dismissed the charges against Solo based on a lack of cooperation from both alleged victims. Solo claimed she was defending herself from an attack by her nephew, who is 6 feet 9 inches 206 cm . However, prosecutors filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Washington. In October 2015, the prosecution prevailed in the Superior Court and the charges were reinstated. In June 2016, the state appeals court denied Solo's petition to review the case. On May 24, 2018, the city of Kirkland dismissed all domestic violence charges against her. Attorney Melissa Osman, who represents the city, wrote in court documents the circumstances of the case were unlikely to recur , and prosecution witnesses did not want to testify. Solo has signed endorsement deals with Seiko, Simple Skincare, Nike, BlackBerry, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Gatorade. In July 2011, she signed a one year endorsement deal with Bank of America. In September 2011, she starred in an EA Sports television commercial along with professional basketball player Steve Nash, promoting FIFA 12. In the same month, she co starred with national teammate Alex Morgan in a television commercial promoting ESPN's SportsCenter. In 2014, she was featured in a promotional piece for Western Union. Solo signed with LX Ventures, Inc. and Mobio as a social media influencer in March 2014. In June 2016, she partnered with Organically Raw to promote their Shanti Bar line of energy and protein bars. Solo is a representative of the Women's Sports Foundation, an organization founded by Billie Jean King that is dedicated to advancing the lives of girls and women through sports and physical activity. She has donated her time and money to the Boys and Girls Club and made appearances at numerous charity events. In August 2011, she joined teammates Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach in a Bank of America charitable campaign at the Chicago Marathon, as 5,000 was donated to Seattle Humane Society on her behalf. In 2012, Solo was one of 15 professional athletes including Shaun Phillips, Tim Lincecum, Ray Rice and others who participated in Popchips' Game Changers program. She made appearances at several charity events and money was donated to a local charity that she selected.

She has made appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman, Piers Morgan Tonight, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Chelsea Lately, and Whitney. Solo was the focus of an ESPN E 60 episode in 2012. During her interview by Jeremy Schaap, she told of her experience at the 2007 World Cup as well as her childhood. In 2013, she was featured in the PBS documentary, Makers Women Who Make America and ESPN documentary series, Nine for IX. The Nine for IX documentary, Branded, in which Solo appeared focused on the marketing of female professional athletes and the double standard that they often face with more value placed on beauty rather than their athletic excellence. Branded received the highest viewership of all of the documentaries in the series. In 2016, Solo starred with teammates Megan Rapinoe and Crystal Dunn in a docu series called Keeping Score broadcast by Fullscreen. The episodes followed the athletes as they prepared for the 2016 Rio Olympics and addressed issues such as equal pay and racism. The season's final episode showed her reaction after learning she had been suspended from the national team.

Of the experience, she said, I'm an athletethat's all I am. If a sex symbol is now a top female athlete, I think that's pretty amazing and it shows how far our country has come from the stick thin models, from what you see in most magazines. On August 14, 2012, after the London Olympics, Solo released her autobiography Solo A Memoir of Hope co authored with sports columnist and commentator Ann Killion and published by Harper Collins. In her book she provided her accounts of incidents with former U.S. national coach Greg Ryan, and her Dancing with the Stars' partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy.

In October of the same year, the team was honored by President Barack Obama at the White House.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope%20Solo
"Solomon Greek was an East Roman Byzantine general from northern Mesopotamia, who distinguished himself as a commander in the Vandalic War and the reconquest of North Africa in 533534. He spent most of the next decade in Africa as its governor general, combining the military post of magister militum with the civil position of praetorian prefect. Solomon successfully confronted the large scale Moorish rebellion, but was forced to flee following an army mutiny in spring of 536. His second tenure in Africa began in 539 and it was marked by victories over the Moors, which led to the consolidation of the Byzantine position. A few years of prosperity followed, but were cut short by the rekindled Moorish revolt and Solomon's defeat and death at the Battle of Cillium in 544. Solomon was born, probably circa 480 490, in the fortress of Idriphthon in the district of Solachon, near Dara in the province of Mesopotamia. He was a eunuch as a result of an accident during his infancy, not from deliberate castration. Solomon had a brother, Bacchus, who became a priest. Bacchus fathered three sons, Cyrus, Sergius and Solomon, who later became military officers in Africa under their uncle Sergius also succeeded Solomon as governor of Africa after the latter's death. Little is known of Solomon's early career, except that he served under the dux Mesopotamiae Felicissimus, perhaps as early as the latter's installment to the post in 505 506. Certainly by 527, when he came to the service of General Belisarius, Solomon was considered an experienced officer. It is perhaps at this time that he was named Belisarius's domesticus, or chief of staff, the post with which he is mentioned by the historian Procopius in 533, before the onset of the campaign against the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa. Before the expedition sailed from Constantinople, Solomon was named as one of the nine commanders of the foederati regiments. He is not mentioned in Procopius's narrative during the subsequent campaign, but he probably participated in the decisive Battle of Ad Decimum on 13 September 533, which opened the road for the Vandal capital of Carthage. Following the capture of Carthage, Belisarius sent Solomon back to Constantinople to inform Emperor Justinian I r. 527565 of the campaign's progress. Solomon remained in the capital until the spring of 534, when Justinian sent him back to Africa to recall Belisarius and replace him as military commander of the new praetorian prefecture of Africa magister militum Africae . Belisarius's departure coincided with a general uprising of the Moorish tribes of the interior, before the Byzantines had time to strengthen their hold on the province. As a result, Belisarius left most of his privately raised bucellarii behind, and Emperor Justinian sent additional reinforcements. Soon sometime in autumn of 534 Emperor Justinian also invested Solomon with the civil office of praetorian prefect as well, replacing the aged Archelaus. In the meantime, the Moors had invaded Byzacena and defeated the local Byzantine garrison, killing its commanders, Gainas and Rufinus. After diplomatic entreaties over the winter failed, and with his forces bolstered to some 18,000 men as estimated by Charles Diehl following the arrival of reinforcements, in spring 535 Solomon led his troops into Byzacena. The Moors, under their chiefs Cutzinas, Esdilasas, Iourphouthes and Mesidinissas had encamped at a location called Mammes. Solomon attacked them there and defeated them. The Byzantine army returned to Carthage, but there news came that the Moors, reinforced, had again attacked and overrun Byzacena. Solomon immediately marched out and met them at Mount Bourgaon, where the Moors had erected a fortified camp and awaited his attack. Solomon divided his forces and sent 1,000 men to attack the Moors from behind, scoring a decisive victory the Moors broke and scattered, suffering great casualties. Those who survived fled to Numidia, where they joined the forces of Iaudas, the leader of the tribes of Mount Aurasium. With Byzacena secured, and urged by his own Moorish allies Massonas and Ortaias, Solomon now turned to Numidia. He cautiously advanced to Aurasium and challenged Iaudas to battle, but after three days, distrusting the loyalty of his allies, Solomon returned his army to the plains. He left part of the army to keep watch on the Moors and established a series of fortified posts along the roads linking Byzacena with Numidia. Solomon then spent the winter preparing a new expedition against Aurasium and also against the Moors of Sardinia, but his designs were interrupted by a major army mutiny in spring 536. The revolt was caused by dissatisfaction of some of the soldiers, who had taken Vandal wives, with Solomon the soldiers demanded the property once owned by their wives as their own, but Solomon refused, since this land had been confiscated by imperial decree. A first plot to assassinate Solomon in Easter failed and the conspirators fled into the countryside, but soon open rebellion broke out among the army in Carthage as well. The soldiers acclaimed one of Solomon's subalterns, Theodore, as its leader, and began looting the city. Solomon managed to find refuge in a church, and under the cover of night, with the aid of Theodore, he departed the city by boat for Missua, accompanied among others by the historian Procopius. From there, Solomon and Procopius sailed to Sicily, which had just been conquered by Belisarius, while Solomon's lieutenant Martin was dispatched to try and reach the troops at Numidia, and Theodore instructed to hold Carthage. Upon hearing about the mutiny, Belisarius, with Solomon and 100 picked men, set sail for Africa. Carthage was being besieged by 9,000 rebels, including many Vandals, under a certain Stotzas. Theodore was contemplating capitulation when Belisarius appeared. The news of the famous general's arrival were sufficient for the rebels to abandon the siege and withdraw westwards. Belisarius immediately gave pursuit and caught up and defeated the rebel forces at Membresa. The bulk of the rebels, however, was able to flee, and continued to march towards Numidia, where the local troops decided to join them. Belisarius himself was forced to return to Italy due to trouble there, and Emperor Justinian appointed his cousin Germanus as magister militum to deal with the crisis. Solomon returned to Constantinople. Germanus was successful in winning the confidence of many soldiers, re establishing discipline and defeating the mutineers at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in 537. With imperial control over the army restored, Solomon was sent back to Africa to replace Germanus in 539, again combining in his person the posts of magister militum and praetorian prefect in the meantime, he had also been raised to the rank of patricius and named an honorary consul . Solomon further reinforced his control of the army by weeding out unreliable soldiers, sending them to Belisarius in Italy and to the East by expelling all remaining Vandals from the province and by initiating a massive programme of fortification across the region. In 539 AD Solomon ... devoted the energies of the state to an enormous building programme that fortified the Byzantine province of Africa. The open cities and villa dotted countryside of the past was transformed into a medieval landscape of small walled towns surrounded by fortified manor houses ... at the same time sewer systems were overhauled, aqueducts reconnected, harbours cleared and grandiose churches erected to dominate the new urban centres ... The three great rectangular military fortresses, which were constructed on the south western frontier zone of Tebessa, Thelepte and Ammaedara, would have required over a million laboring days in their construction. In 540, Solomon led his army again against the Moors of Mount Aurasium. Initially, the Moors attacked and besieged the Byzantine advance guard, under Guntharis, at their camp in Bagai, but Solomon with the main army came to the rescue. The Moors had to abandon the attack and retreated to Babosis on the foothills of Aurasium, where they pitched camp. Solomon attacked them there and defeated them. The surviving Moors fled south to Aurasium or west into Mauretania, but their leader Iaudas sought refuge in the fortress of Zerboule. Solomon and his troops plundered the fertile plains around Thamugad, gathering the rich harvest for themselves, before moving onto Zerboule. Once there, they found Iaudas gone, having fled to the remote fortress of Toumar. The Byzantines moved up to besiege Toumar, but the siege proved problematic because of the barren terrain, and in particular the lack of water. While Solomon was considering how best to attack the inaccessible fortress, a minor skirmish between the two forces gradually escalated into a full scale and confused battle, as more and more soldiers from both sides joined in. The Byzantines emerged victorious, while the Moors fled from the field. Shortly after, the Byzantines also captured the fort at the so called Rock of Geminianus , where Iaudas had sent his wives and treasure. This victory left Solomon in control of Aurasium, where he built a number of fortresses. With Aurasium secured, effective Byzantine control was established in the provinces of Numidia and Mauretania Sitifensis. Aided by the captured treasure of Iaudas, Solomon extended his fortification programme in these two provinces some two dozen inscriptions testifying to his building activity survive from the area. The Moorish rebellion seemed beaten for good, and contemporary chroniclers are unanimous in declaring the next few years as a golden era of peace and prosperity. In the words of Procopius, all the Libyans who were subjects of the Romans, coming to enjoy secure peace and finding the rule of Solomon wise and very moderate, and having no longer any thought of hostility in their minds, seemed the most fortunate of all men . This tranquility lasted until 542 543 when the great plague arrived in Africa and caused many casualties, especially among members of the army. In addition, in early 543 the Moors in Byzacena became restive. Solomon executed the brother of the chieftain Antalas, whom he held responsible for the disturbances, and ceased the subsidies granted to Antalas, alienating the powerful and hitherto loyal chieftain. At the same time, Solomon's nephew Sergius, newly named governor of Tripolitania as a token of Emperor Justinian's gratitude along with his brother Cyrus in the Pentapolis , caused the outbreak of hostilities with the tribal confederation of the Leuathae when his men killed 80 of their leaders at a banquet. Although in a subsequent battle near Leptis Magna he was victorious, in early 544 Sergius was forced to travel to Carthage and seek his uncle's aid. The rebellion spread quickly from Tripolitania to Byzacena, where Antalas joined it. Joined by his three nephews, Solomon marched against the Moors as they assembled, meeting them near Theveste. Last minute diplomatic overtures to the Leuathae failed, and the two armies clashed at Cillium, on the border of Numidia and Byzacena. The Byzantine army was riven by disunity, with many soldiers refusing to fight or doing so only reluctantly. The contemporary poet Flavius Cresconius Corippus even accused Guntharis of treason, alleging that he withdrew from the line with his troops, causing a general and disorderly Byzantine retreat. Solomon and his bodyguard stood their ground and resisted but at last they were forced to retreat. Solomon's horse stumbled and fell in a ravine, wounding its rider. With the aid of his guards, Solomon remounted, but they were quickly overcome and slain. Solomon was succeeded by his nephew Sergius, who proved completely inadequate in dealing with the situation. The Moors launched a general revolt and inflicted a severe defeat on the Byzantines in Thacia in 545. Sergius was recalled, while the army mutinied again, this time under Guntharis, who captured Carthage and installed himself there as an independent ruler. His usurpation did not last long as he was assassinated by Artabanes, but it was not until the arrival of John Troglita in late 546 and his subsequent campaigns that the province was to be pacified and brought again securely under Byzantine imperial control.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%20%28Byzantine%20general%29
"Solomon Creek is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately 8.8 miles 14.2 km long and flows through Fairview Township, Hanover Township, and Wilkes Barre. The creek is affected by acid mine drainage and has significant loads of iron, aluminum, and manganese. The creek's named tributaries are Spring Run, Sugar Notch Run, and Pine Creek. The Solomon Creek watershed is located in the Anthracite Valley section of the ridge and valley geographical province. Major rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Spechty Kopf Formation, and the Catskill Formation. Solomon Creek was first settled by Native Americans around 8000 to 6000 B.C.E. A settler arrived at the confluence of the creek with the Susquehanna River by 1774. In the 1800s, more people began arriving in the watershed to exploit its natural resources. Anthracite mining was especially prevalent in the watershed in the 19th and 20th centuries, to the point that numerous streams were altered or destroyed and the Laurel Run mine fire started. Solomon Creek was devoid of fish in the 1970s. However, since then several fish species, including brook trout, have inhabited the creek and its tributaries. A number of varieties of aquatic insects are also present. Solomon Creek starts on western Penobscot Mountain in northern Fairview Township and flows west down the mountain for a short distance before turning northwards, paralleling Pennsylvania Route 309 and briefly Pennsylvania Route 437. The creek then enters Hanover Township. It picks up Pine Creek and cuts a gap through Wilkes Barre Mountain and then through Ashley. Upon leaving Ashley, it heads into Wilkes Barre, picking up Sugar Notch Run and Spring Run. The creek soon turns west into Hanover Township again, having flowed 6 miles 9.7 km by this point. It enters the Susquehanna River at Hanover Green. Sugar Notch Run, Pine Creek and Spring Run are two tributaries of Solomon Creek. Sugar Notch Run is 3.46 miles 5.57 km long, Pine Creek is 7.68 miles 12.36 km long, and Spring Run is 2.93 miles 4.72 km long. Spring Run is an intermittent stream. There are two other ephemeral tributaries that are not officially named, but are known locally as Sulfur Run and the Lee Park tributary. Historically, Solomon Creek had at least seven tributaries, including one named Buttonwood Creek. However, several tributaries largely disappeared by the late 1890s due to mining in the watershed. Solomon Creek has an orange color as it flows past Wilkes Barre, due to acid mine drainage. The tributaries Sugar Notch Run and Spring Run lose most of their discharge 75 in the case of Spring Run when passing over subterranean mine pools. The discharge of the creek is 3.39 cubic feet per second. Between 1938 and 1989, the highest recorded discharge of the creek was 2450 cubic feet per second. This occurred on August 18, 1955. The discharge was not higher than 1610 cubic feet per second on any other year during that time period. The daily load of aluminum in Solomon Creek ranges from 8.8 pounds 4.0 kg at a site below Pine Creek to 87.9 pounds 39.9 kg at the Buttonwood Tunnel. The average load is 29.6 pounds 13.4 kg per day. The lowest load of iron is 0 pounds 0 kg per day at the site below Pine Creek and Solomon Creek at Sugar Notch Run and the highest is 9,624 pounds 4,365 kg per day at the Buttonwood Tunnel. The average is 2,305.5 pounds 1,045.8 kg per day. The Solomon Creek boreholes and the Nottingham Buttonwood Airshaft are the second largest and third largest sources of iron discharge in the Coal Region, contributing 9.07 and 7.85 of the iron load in the region, respectively. The daily load of manganese ranges between 0.7 pounds 0.32 kg above Pine Creek and 1,086 pounds 493 kg at the Buttonwood Tunnel and the average daily load is 260.1 pounds 118.0 kg . The load of acidity in the creek ranges from 0 at site SR to 1,506.1 pounds 683.2 kg per day at the Buttonwood Tunnel. The average load of acidity per day is 628.9 pounds 285.3 kg . The alkalinity load ranges from 288.4 pounds 130.8 kg on Sugar Notch Run to 135,660.8 pounds 61,534.7 kg at the Buttonwood Tunnel. The average daily load of alkalinity is 23,716 pounds 10,757 kg . At a large number of sites within the Solomon Creek watershed in 2011, the water temperature ranged from 34 F 1 C at site SC12 to 70 C 158 F at sites above, below, and on Sugar Notch Run. At these same sites, the pH ranged from 4.5 at a site on Sugar Notch Run to 7.5 two sites on an unnamed tributary, one site below Sugar Notch Run, and a site on another unnamed tributary. The iron concentration ranged from 0 at over 20 sites to 36 milligrams per liter at an acid mine drainage discharge in the watershed. The concentration of dissolved oxygen ranged from 0 at eight sites to 13 milligrams per liter at SU01, and on Pine Creek northeast of Pennsylvania Route 309 and below Unnamed Tributary 4. There are six locations in the Solomon Creek watershed where mine drainage is discharged. Ten miles sixteen kilometers of the streams on the creek's watershed are rendered devoid of life by mine drainage. According to Robert Hughes, the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation's executive director, the water level of Solomon Creek has risen since the middle of the 19th century. There are large amounts of sediment along the creek. Sediment piles are over 2 feet 0.61 m on the creek at Division Street and 3 feet 0.91 m or 4 feet 1.2 m in the Brookside area. Sewage is discharged into the creek at several locations. It has been discharged into the creek since at least 1909. Additionally, there are debris dams in various areas on the creek. Solomon Creek is located at the edge of the ridge and valley geographic province, in the Anthracite Valley section. There is a ridge in the creek's watershed called the Wilkes Barre Mountain. On the ridge, the Mauch Chunk Formation exists, with red shale, sandstone, and siltstone. Other significant rock formations in the watershed include the Pocono Formation with olive and gray rocks and the Spechty Kopf formation. Under the Spechty Kopf formation lie rocks of the Catskill Formation. The watershed is located in the Wyoming Coal Basin, the southwestern sub basin of the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. The creek's headwaters have glacial deposition from the Wisconsonian glacial period. At the headwaters of the tributary Spring Creek, there is a rock formation of light gray conglomerate called Prospect Rock. It is 1,394 feet 425 m above sea level and 2.25 miles 3.62 km southeast of Wilkes Barre's Public Square. An unconformity lies between the Catskill Formation and the Spechty Kopf Formation. The sandstone in the latter formation are mostly cross bedded, although some areas have planar bedding. The Llewellyn Formation, containing conglomerate and sandstone is found in the Spring Run and Sugar Notch Run sub watersheds. The upper part of Solomon Creek is located in the Pocono Plateau. The lowest elevation in the watershed is 560 feet 170 m on the western side of the creek's floodplain. The highest elevation is 2,148 feet 655 m on Haystack Mountain. The elevation of the creek's mouth is 594 feet 181 m above sea level. The creek's source is just under 1,840 feet 560 m above sea level. There are 14 coal seams in the Solomon Creek watershed. The deepest seam is the Bottom Red Ash. Other seams included the Middle Red Ash, the Top Red Ash, the Checker Bed, the Pittston Bed, the Ross Bed, the Skidmore Bed, the Kidney Bed, the Snake Island Bed, the Hillman Bed, and the Abbott Bed. There are also three numbered beds called the 2, 3, and 4 beds. Historically, parts of the seams were within 50 feet 15 m of the surface, but they were completely mined. Areas along the banks of the creek are covered in coal ash, coal silt, sand, and gravel. There are gravel bars and point bars in the lower reaches of the creek. The lower reaches of Solomon Creek have a 0.2 grade. In the Solomon Gap, there are piles coal ash that is pink and orange due to oxidation. These piles rise as high as 60 feet 18 m to 100 feet 30 m . Similarly colored coal is found in sediment and gravel bars in the creek. Soils in the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 207, in the Solomon Creek watershed, include the Arnot Rock outcrop complex. On hills with a grade higher than 25 , the steep variety of this soil appears. It is a dark brown silt loam with a bedrock depth of 12 inches 30 cm . It has fast runoff and 3 to 40 of the surface is covered with boulders. The regular variety of this soil, which occurs on slopes with a grade of 8 to 25 , is the same, but has a bedrock depth of 18 inches 46 cm and slower runoff. The area of Solomon Creek's watershed is 18.2 square miles. The watershed area is 60 forested land and 26 developed land. Nearly 7 of the land is considered disturbed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This includes abandoned coal mines and quarries. In specific, 6748 acres are forest, 1839 acres are considered low intensity development by the Environmental Protection Agency, 1174 acres are considered high intensity development by the Environmental Protection Agency 509 acres are devoted to hay or pastureland, and 492 acres are considered transition by the Environmental Protection Agency. Crops are grown on 336 acres, quarries occupy 215 acres, wetland makes up 77 acres, coal mines make up 64 acres, and grass occupies 22 acres. There are a total of 26.66 miles 42.91 km stream miles in the watershed. Deciduous forest occupies much of the southern part of the watershed. Most of the agricultural land is located on a floodplain at the mouth of the creek. There are nine municipalities in the Solomon Creek watershed. Most of the watershed is in Ashley, Laurel Run, Wilkes Barre Township, and Hanover Township. Smaller parts of the watershed are in Wilkes Barre, Bear Creek Township, Fairview Township, Rice Township, and Sugar Notch. In the 2000 United States Census, there were 928 households in the Solomon Creek area and an average household size of 4.6 people. This indicates a population of 4269 for the Solomon Creek watershed. There is a higher than average concentration of people over 65 years of age in the watershed. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 81 and Pennsylvania Route 309. There are five designated sub watersheds of the Solomon Creek watershed. They are the upper and lower Solomon Creek watershed, the Pine Creek watershed, the Spring Run watershed, and the Sugar Notch Run watershed. Neighboring watersheds include those of Little Wapwallopen Creek and Big Wapwallopen Creek. Native Americans settled in the Solomon Creek watershed by approximately 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C. Ebenezer Hibbard was an early European settler on the creek, living there by 1772. The creek is named after a person with the surname of Solomon, who settled at the mouth of the creek in 1774. In the early 1800s, Europeans first realized the natural resources of the watershed. In the early 1800s, there was a tavern called Inman's Tavern and several cabins in the Solomon Gap. In the mid 1800s, the population of the watershed increased significantly due to coal mining and timbering opportunities. The first road in Fairview Township, the Wilkes Barre and Hazleton Turnpike, started at Solomon Creek. There are waterfalls called Solomon's Falls on Solomon Creek. They were called a beautiful cascade by Philadelphia's Portfolio in 1809, although a 1909 book stated that the waterfalls were no longer picturesque or delightful . The falls were between 50 feet 15 m and 60 feet 18 m . In 1809, Richard and Israel Inman constructed a gristmill at the foot of Solomon's Falls. It was converted to a house in 1833 and destroyed in 1850. A gristmill on the creek in Hanover Township had been built by 1812 and was run by George Mesinger. It was destroyed in 1840. In 1845, William Petty constructed the gristmill called Petty Mill in Hanover Township. This mill burned down in 1887. The Wyoming Division Canal, which was constructed in the 1830s, started at Solomon Creek. Construction of the Ashley Planes in the Solomon Creek gap began in 1837. They were used until 1848. An iron producing forge operated on the creek in Ashley until 1839. There was also a sawmill on it until 1839. A powder mill operated on Solomon Creek, but was replaced with a brewery by 1885. A slaughterhouse discharged its waste into the creek in the early 20th century. The creek was used as the water supply for the Huber Breaker from the 1930s to the 1970s. The Wilkes Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Solomon Creek. Mining has been done in the Solomon Creek watershed in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining began in the beginning of the 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012. A mine fire known as the Laurel Run mine fire started burning in the watershed of Solomon Creek since 1915, when a miner accidentally left a carbide lamp hanging from a timber support in the Red Ash Coal Mine. The lamp caused the support to catch fire. The fire may continue into the 22nd century. The fire was contained in 1973, but was not extinguished. Had the fire not been contained, it would have eventually spread under the entirety of the Wyoming Valley. The fire burns between 200 feet 61 m and 300 feet 91 m underground at a temperature of approximately 1,000 F 538 C . The creek flooded in September 1850. It was the most severe flood of the creek up to that time. In January 1996, 400 buildings along Solomon Creek flooded by it due to melting snow. This was one of numerous floods on that area of the creek. Solomon Creek has also been called Chester Creek and Solomon Creek by locals. It was called Moses Creek on maps of Pennsylvania created by William Scull in the 1770s. This last name may be named after an Indian, although it is not known for sure. In 1975, a study found no fish species on the creek. However, brook trout have been observed at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes Barre. Above of the South Wilkes Barre borehole, a number of other fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township. The most common aquatic insects at the headwaters of unimpaired streams in the watershed of Solomon Creek are alderflies, caddis flies, dragonflies, mayflies, and stoneflies. Three sites in the watershed are considered suboptimal according to the WVSOS system. 20 sites are considered marginal and the remainder are poor . The Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 207 are located in the southeastern part of the Solomon Creek Watershed. They take up 6.7 of the watershed. Parts of Pinchot State Forest are also in the watershed the forest occupies 12.6 of it. Two of the trails in the 139 acre Sugar Notch Trail System are located in the sub watershed of Sugar Notch Run. The creek is stocked with trout in some places. There are ATV trails in the watershed.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%20Creek

"The Solomon Islands skink Corucia zebrata , also known as prehensile tailed skink, monkey tailed skink, giant skink, zebra skink, and monkey skink, is an arboreal species of skink endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is the largest known extant species of skink. The Solomon Islands skink is completely herbivorous, eating many different fruits and vegetables including the pothos plant. It is one of the few species of reptile known to function within a social group or circulus. Both male and female specimens are known to be territorial and often hostile towards members not a part of their family group. Corucia is a monotypic genus, containing a single species. However, in 1997 it was determined that there are two subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink the common monkey tailed skink Corucia zebrata zebrata and the northern monkey tailed skink Corucia zebrata alfredschmidti . Among other variances, the northern skink is smaller and has darker eyes with a black sclera. Extensive logging is a serious threat to the survival of this species. Consumption for food by indigenous Solomon Islanders and excessive pet trade exports have affected wild populations. Export of this species from the Solomon Islands is now restricted and the animal is protected under CITES appendix II. The Solomon Islands skink was first described by John Edward Gray in 1855 as Corucia zebrata. The generic name Corucia derives from the Latin word coruscus meaning shimmering . This is in reference to Gray's description of a play of colors effect from the body scales . Its specific name zebrata is a Latinized form of the word zebra, in reference to the animal's zebra like stripes. Some of its common names prehensile tailed skink, monkey tailed skink, monkey skink refer to its fully prehensile tail which the species uses as a fifth limb for climbing. Although appearances of Solomon Island skinks vary from island to island, only one subspecies, from the western islands of the Solomons Archipelago, was described by Dr. Gunther Kohler in 1996 as C. z. alfredschmidti, the trinomial name of which is in honor of German amateur herpetologist Alfred A. Schmidt. The closest living relatives of C. zebrata are the blue tongued skinks of the genus Tiliqua and skinks of the genus Egernia of Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia, all of which are also assigned to the subfamily Lygosominae. The Solomon Islands skink is native to Solomon Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the south west Pacific Ocean. The common subspecies C. z. zebrata is found on the islands of Choiseul Island, New Georgia, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Ngela, Malaita, Makira Solomon Islands , Ugi and Santa Ana. The northern subspecies C. z. alfredschmidti is known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka and the Shortland Island Group. Bougainville and Buka are geographically part of the Solomons Archipelago, though politically part of Papua New Guinea. Both subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink are strictly arboreal, usually inhabiting the upper canopy of forested areas throughout its range. It commonly occurs in the strangler fig tree Ficus sp. , provided the epiphytic growth of its several food plants are present. It occurs in trees in semi cleared areas and cultivated food gardens, again provided its food plants occur there. The Solomon Islands skink is the world's largest species of extant skink adults can reach a length of 32 inches 81 cm from nose to the tip of their tail when fully grown, with the tail accounting for more than half this length. The Solomon Islands skink has a long, slender body, strong, short legs, and a triangular shaped head with small round eyes. The skink has a strong crushing jaw but the teeth are small and used for eating plant material. Its prehensile tail helps it maneuver from branch to branch with ease and gives the skink its more common names monkey tailed skink, prehensile tailed skink, or monkey skink. Male Solomon Islands skinks tend to have a broader head and a more slender body shape than do female skinks. Males have a V shaped pattern of scales just aft of the cloacal opening, which is not present in female skinks. The scales of Solomon Islands skinks are a dark green but are often speckled with light brown or black. The scales on the underside vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs. As a crepuscular animal, it is most active during the dusk and dawn hours, feeding primarily at dusk. it also is active and eats during the hours of dawn, though to a lesser extent. it has quite good eyesight and relies upon it to identify threats, as well as potential food.. it relies heavily on its sense of smell, and uses it to identify its territory and other members of its group, called a circulus. Like snakes, the skink smells by flicking its tongue to gather scents and when the tongue is retracted it touches it to the opening of a Jacobson's organ at the roof of its mouth. The common Solomon Islands skink C. z. zebrata has a white sclera with its eyes while the northern Solomon Islands skink C. z. alfredschmidti has a black sclera. The iris of the northern Solomon Islands skink is a mix of green and yellow whereas the iris of the common Solomon Islands skink can vary from several different shades of green to orange to a dark black. According to Dr. Gunther Kohler, who described the northern subspecies, this subspecies possesses larger dorsal and ventral scales and has seven instead of usually five parietal scales . The northern Solomon Islands skink is the shorter of the two subspecies with males averaging 24 inches 61 cm and females averaging 22 inches 56 cm in length when measured from nose to tip of tail. The common Solomon Islands skinks are slightly longer with the males averaging 28 inches 71 cm and the females averaging 24 inches 61 cm when measured from nose to tip of tail. The common Solomon Islands skink, at 850 grams 1.87 lb , weighs more than the northern Solomon Islands skink, which weighs closer to 500 grams 1.1 lb . Solomon Islands skinks are herbivores, feeding on the leaves, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of several different species of plants. This includes the somewhat toxic due to high concentrations of calcium oxalate Epipremnum pinnatum cf.E. aureum plant, a which the lizard eats without ill effect. b Juvenile skinks often eat feces from adults in order to acquire the essential microflora to digest their food. Newborn skinks have been observed consuming their placental sac after birth and will not feed on other food for the first 2 days. The Solomon Islands skink is one of the few species of reptile that lives in a communal group known as a circulus. The Solomon Islands skink reproduces by viviparous matrotrophy c the female provides a placenta for its young, which are born after a gestation period of six to eight months this is a rare trait among reptiles. The newborn skink is of a large size compared to its mother the northern Solomon Islands skinks are approximately 29 centimetres 11 in in length and weigh 80 grams 0.18 lb , whereas the common Solomon Islands skinks are 30 centimetres 12 in and 175 grams 0.386 lb when they are born. This reduced size disparity led the former curator of reptiles at the Philadelphia Zoo, Dr. Kevin Wright, to compare it to a human mother giving birth to a six yearold . Almost all births are single babies but occasionally twins will be born. At least one instance of triplets has occurred according to herpetologist Bert Langerwerf. The newborn skink will stay within its circulus for six to twelve months during which time it will be protected by not only its parents but other unrelated adult skinks within the group. Around one year of age, sometimes earlier, the juvenile will move off to form a new family group. Individuals have been documented to stay within the group for several births without being expelled, however. Females exhibit fierce protective behavior around the time of birth this protectiveness of young is a rare occurrence in reptiles but is shorter in duration when compared to the protective behavior exhibited by a typical mammal. Extensive logging is a serious ongoing threat to the survival of this species, as is consumption for food by native people, and export demand for the pet trade. Because of the large numbers of lizards that were being exported for the pet trade, the small region to which the skink is native, and its low reproductive rate, in 1992 Corucia zebrata was listed as a CITES Appendix II animal, which allows limits to be placed on the number of animals in commercial trade between countries. Since there is no regulation on the rapid deforestation occurring in the Solomon Islands, limited export to recognized institutions may be needed to aid this species in genetic diversity for its survival via ex situ breeding programs. According to herpetologists who study the Solomon Islands skink, such as Dr. David Kirkpatrick and the late Dr. Kevin Wright, captive breeding alone is not practical as a sole method of species survival due to the limited number of offspring and long gestation periods. The Solomon Islands skink is represented in both public and private collections. The Philadelphia Zoo has bred these skinks over multiple generations for the past 40 years. The keeping of the Solomon Islands skink in captivity is not without its challenges as it is a large arboreal tropical animal. It requires a large arboreal enclosure, with a constant temperature between 7580 degrees Fahrenheit, with heat being provided from above as well as below, allowing the skink to bask in the heat from above as it would during dusk, while providing a radiant heat from below to aid digestion. The dynamics of the skink's circulus means that not all groups do well when new animals are introduced. Despite successful breeding programs, their somewhat unusual nature of single births and slow growth has made these programs challenging. A well cared for monkey tailed skink can live twenty five to thirty years. A well balanced diet consisting primarily of kale, green beans, and cooked sweet potato, supplemented with slices of peeled kiwi fruit, apple, and papaya, as well as access to a large shallow, clean water source aid in increasing longevity. Bathing them in shallow lukewarm water during the beginning of the monthly shed, greatly reduces the stress inherent in shedding, as well as speeds the process. Biologist Michael Balsai of Temple University has noted a significant number of breedings between skinks from different islands has resulted in non productive unions. Balsai's theory is that there are enough differences between animals from different islands that pairing of lizards from different locales will be unproductive, further frustrating many captive breeding attempts.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%20Islands%20skink
"The flag of Solomon Islands was adopted in 1977, replacing the British Blue Ensign defaced with the arms of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. It has been the flag of Solomon Islands since 18 November of that year, eight months before the country gained independence. It consists of a thin, yellow stripe dividing diagonally from the lower hoist side corner. The upper triangle is blue and the canton charged with five white stars the lower triangle is green. Although the number of provinces has increased from the five original provinces, the number of stars on the flag remains unchanged. In 1886, Germany and Britain agreed to partition the Solomon Islands archipelago, with Britain to assume control of the southern section. This southern area later became the sovereign nation of Solomon Islands. Seven years later, in 1893, Britain declared this area a British protectorate. At the turn of the 20th century, Germany gave up their northern part to Britain in exchange for Britain's acceptance of German claims over German Samoa and areas in Africa. During this time, the British Union Jack and Red Ensign were flown throughout the Solomon Islands archipelago, as well as a Blue Ensign, defaced with the protectorate's name and the monarch's crown within the Solomon Islands Protectorate. In 1947, a new flag for the protectorate was introduced featuring a red field charged with a black and white sea turtle. Nine years later in 1956, this had to be modified because the turtle was a motif affiliated only with Central Province. The revised version of 1956 saw the field divided quarterly and displaying a lion for Britain and an eagle, a turtle, a frigate bird and assorted weapons from the region for the five provinces. In 1975, during the lead up to independence, a contest was held to design a new flag for the future country. One of the submissions contained the nation's coat of arms, while the initial winning design had a blue field with a yellow circle, encompassed with chains and charged with a black frigate bird. However, this was eventually rescinded, since this bird was attributed to only one province as opposed to the entire country. The second winning design included a red field charged with a black elliptical chain at the centre. As explained by the artist, this alluded to the historical practice of blackbirding in the country and the blood spilt as a result of it. After it was published in a national newspaper, the design stirred up much debate in the community and it too was scrapped. Ultimately, the last design was created by a New Zealander then teaching at the King George VI School, in the eastern part of the capital Honiara. This was in spite of the fact that preference was supposed to be given to local submissions by Solomon Islanders. It was ratified as the new flag of the islands on 18 November 1977, eight months before the country became the final British protectorate to gain independence. The Union Jack was finally lowered and the new flag raised in an Independence Day ceremony on 7 July 1978 in Gizo, Western Province. Although the ceremony had already been designed to be as low key as possible, it was marked by controversy and a confrontation between locals from Western Province and those from Malaita Province. This arose because leaders from the Western Council had unsuccessfully lobbied the government to promise greater devolved powers to the provinces, and some of the province's inhabitants viewed the flag ceremony as a demonstration of Malaitan dominance over Western Province. Since 2012, the Solomon Islands flag may be used as a flag of convenience by foreign merchant vessels under an Act made by the country's National Parliament. The government hoped to attract over US 500,000 in annual tax revenues from this and the transport minister claimed that this would also give local sailors new employment opportunities and the potential to earn foreign exchange. The design consists of a narrow, yellow stripe dividing the flag diagonally from the lower hoist side corner to the upper fly side corner. The upper triangle is blue with five, white, five pointed stars arranged in three offset rows at the canton in the shape of the letter X. . The lower triangle is green. Its technical description in Blazon is Per bend sinister azure and vert, a riband sinister or, in dexter chief five stars in saltire argent . These colours and symbols carry cultural, political, and regional meanings the blue represents the importance of both fresh and salt water, in the form of rivers, rain and the Pacific Ocean. the green represents the land with the trees and crops that grow on it. the yellow represents the sun and its rays separating the land and the ocean the five stars represent the five provinces in existence at the time of independence. The stars do not represent the Southern Cross as is the case with the flags of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa. New provinces have been created since independence but the number of stars remains unchanged. In 2014, proposals were made for an alternative design to replace the current Australian flag. These proposals included the 'Southern Horizon' and the 'Southern Field' designs both popular in an unofficial poll of more than 8,000 people. Their blue, gold, and green colour schemes and the inclusion of the Southern Cross are noted for their striking resemblance to the Solomon Islands flag, which preceded both the proposals by 37 years. The civil ensign for merchant ships and state ensign for non military government vessels are red and blue flags, respectively, with the national flag in the canton. The naval ensign for police vessels is based on the British white ensign, a red cross on a white field, also with the national flag in the canton.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag%20of%20Solomon%20Islands
"Solomon, also Salomon Hungarian Salamon 1053 1087 was King of Hungary from 1063. Being the elder son of Andrew I, he was crowned king in his father's lifetime in 1057 or 1058. However, he was forced to flee from Hungary after his uncle, Bela I, dethroned Andrew in 1060. Assisted by German troops, Solomon returned and was again crowned king in 1063. On this occasion he married Judith, sister of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. In the following year he reached an agreement with his cousins, the three sons of Bela I. Geza, Ladislaus and Lampert acknowledged Solomon's rule, but in exchange received one third of the kingdom as a separate duchy. In the following years, Solomon and his cousins jointly fought against the Czechs, the Cumans and other enemies of the kingdom. Their relationship deteriorated in the early 1070s and Geza rebelled against him. Solomon could only maintain his rule in a small zone along the western frontiers of Hungary after his defeat in the Battle of Mogyorod on 14 March 1074. He officially abdicated in 1081, but was arrested for conspiring against Geza's brother and successor, Ladislaus. Solomon was set free during the canonization process of the first king of Hungary, Stephen I, in 1083. In an attempt to regain his crown, Solomon allied with the Pechenegs, but King Ladislaus defeated their invading troops. According to a nearly contemporaneous source, Solomon died on a plundering raid in the Byzantine Empire. Later legends say that he survived and died as a saintly hermit in Pula Croatia . Solomon was a son of King Andrew I of Hungary and his wife, Anastasia of Kiev. His parents were married in about 1038. He was born in 1053 as his parents' second child and eldest son. His father had him crowned king in 1057 or 1058. Solomon's coronation was a fundamental condition of his engagement to Judith, a sister of Henry IV, King of Germany. Their engagement put an end to the more than ten year long period of armed conflicts between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire. However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, Bela, who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority. Bela had, since around 1048, administered the so called ducatus or duchy, which encompassed one third of the kingdom. According to the Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle, a 14th century chronicle Because carnal love and ties of blood are wont to prove a hindrance to truthfulness, in King Andreas love for his son overcame justice, so that he broke the treaty of his promise, which in kings should not be in the twelfth year of his reign, when he was worn out with age, he caused his son Salomon, who was still a child of five years, to be anointed and crowned king over all Hungary. He pretended that he did this to prevent injury to his kingdom, for the Emperor would not have given his daughter to his son Salomon unless he had crowned him. When therefore they sang at Salomon's coronation Be lord over thy brethren, and it was told to Duke Bela by an interpreter that the infant Salomon had been made king over him, he was greatly angered. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, in order to secure Solomon's succession, his father arranged a meeting with Duke Bela at the royal manor in Tiszavarkony. The king proposed that his brother choose between a crown and a sword which were the symbols of royal and ducal power, respectively , but had previously commanded his men to murder the duke if Bela picked the crown. The duke, whom a courtier had informed of the king's plan, chose the crown, then left Hungary after the meeting. He sought the assistance of Duke Boleslaus the Bold of Poland and returned with Polish reinforcements. Bela emerged the victor in the ensuing civil war, during which Solomon's father was mortally injured in a battle. Solomon and his mother fled to the Holy Roman Empire and settled in Melk in Austria. Bela was crowned king on 6 December 1060, but the young German king's advisors, who were staunch supporters of Solomon the fiance of their monarch's sister , refused to conclude a peace treaty with him. In the summer of 1063, the assembly of the German princes decided to invade Hungary in order to restore Solomon. Solomon's uncle died in an accident on 11 September, before the imperial army arrived. His three sonsGeza, Ladislaus and Lampertleft for Poland. Accompanied back to Hungary by German troops, Solomon entered Szekesfehervar without resistance. He was ceremoniously crowned king with the consent and acclamation of all Hungary in September 1063, according to the Illuminated Chronicle. The same source adds that the German monarch seated Solomon upon his father's throne , but did not require him to take an oath of fealty. Solomon's marriage with Henry IV's sister, Judithwho was six years older than her future husband also took place on this occasion. Judith, along with her mother in law Anastasia, became one of her young husband's principal advisors. Solomon's three cousins Geza and his brothers returned after the German troops had been withdrawn from Hungary. They arrived with Polish reinforcements and Solomon sought refuge in the fortress of Moson at the western border of his kingdom. The Hungarian prelates began to mediate between them in order to avoid a new civil war. Solomon and his cousins eventually reached an agreement, which was signed in Gyor on 20 January 1064. Geza and his brothers acknowledged Solomon as lawful king, and Solomon granted them their father's one time ducatus. In token of their reconciliation, Duke Geza put a crown on Solomon's head in the cathedral of Pecs on Easter Sunday. Their relationship remained tense when the cathedral burned down during the following night, they initially accused each other of arson. The episode is described in the Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle as follows flames seized that church and the palaces and all nearby buildings, and they collapsed in one devastating conflagration. Everyone was gripped with fear at the shock of the roaring flames and the terrible shattering of the bells as they fell from the towers and none knew where to turn. The King and the Duke were in an amazed stupor terrified by the suspicion of foul work, each went his separate way. In the morning they were apprised through faithful messengers that in truth there had not been on either side any evil intention of treachery, but that the fire had been happening of chance. The King and the Duke came together again in the goodness of peace. The king and his cousins closely cooperated in the period between 1064 and 1071. Both Solomon and Geza were, in 1065 or 1066, present at the consecration of the Benedictine Zselicszentjakab Abbey, established by Palatine Otto of the Gyor clan, a partisan of the king. They invaded Bohemia together after the Czechs had plundered the region of Trencsen present day Trencin, Slovakia in 1067. During the following year, nomadic tribes broke into Transylvania and plundered the regions, but Solomon and his cousins routed them at Kerles present day Chirales, Romania . The identification of the marauders is uncertain the Annales Posonienses and Simon of Keza write of Pechenegs, the 14th century Hungarian chronicles refer to Cumans, and a Russian chronicle mentions the Cumans and the Vlachs. Pecheneg troops pillaged Syrmia now in Serbia in 1071. As the king and the duke suspected that the soldiers of the Byzantine garrison at Belgrade incited the marauders against Hungary, they decided to attack the fortress. The Hungarian army crossed the river Sava, although the Byzantines blew sulphurous fires by means of machines against their boats. The Hungarians took Belgrade after a siege of three months. However, the Byzantine commander, Niketas, surrendered the fortress to Duke Geza instead of the king he knew that Solomon was a hard man and that in all things he listened to the vile counsels of Count Vid, who was detestable in the eyes both of God and men , according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Division of the war booty caused a new conflict between Solomon and his cousin, because the king granted only a quarter of the booty to the duke, who claimed its third part. Thereafter the duke negotiated with the Byzantine Emperor's envoys and set all the Byzantine captives free without the king's consent. The conflict was further sharpened by Count Vid the Illuminated Chronicle narrates how the count incited the young monarch against his cousins by saying that as two sharp swords cannot be kept in the same scabbard , so the king and the duke cannot reign together in the same kingdom . The Byzantines reoccupied Belgrade in the next year. Solomon decided to invade the Byzantine Empire and ordered his cousins to accompany him. Only Geza joined the king his brother, Ladislaus, remained with half of their troops in the Nyirseg. Solomon and Geza marched along the valley of the river Great Morava as far as Nis. Here the locals made them rich gifts of gold and silver and precious cloaks and Solomon seized the arm of Saint Procopius of Scythopolis. He donated the relic to the Orthodox monastery of Syrmium present day Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia . After their return from the campaign, both Solomon and Geza began to make preparations for their inevitable conflict and were seeking assistance from abroad. They concluded a truce, which was to last from the feast of St Martin until the feast of St George , from 11 November 1073 until 24 April 1074. However, Solomon chose to attack his cousin as soon as the German troops sent by his brother in law arrived in Hungary. The royal army crossed the river Tisza and routed the troops of Geza, who had been abandoned by many of his nobles before the battle, at Kemej on 26 February 1074. A strong army soon arrived in Hungary, headed by Geza's brother in law, Duke Otto I of Olomouc. In the decisive battle, which was fought at Mogyorod on 14 March 1074, Solomon was defeated and forced to flee from the battlefield. After the battle of Mogyorod, Duke Geza's soldiers pursued Solomon and his men from dawn to dusk , but they managed to take refugee in Moson, where his mother and wife had been staying. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, the queen mother blamed her son for the defeat, which filled Solomon with so much anger that he wanted to strike his mother in the face . His wife held him back by catching his hand. Thereafter, Solomon preserved only Moson and the nearby Pressburg Bratislava, Slovakia . Other parts of the kingdom accepted the rule of Geza, who had been proclaimed king after his victory. Solomon sent his envoys to Henry IV and promised six of the strongest fortified cities in Hungary if his brother in law would help him to depose Geza. He was even ready to accept the German monarch's suzerainty. Henry IV invaded Hungary in August. He marched as far as Vac, but soon withdrew from Hungary without defeating Geza. Nevertheless, the German invasion strengthened Solomon's rule in the region of his two fortresses, where he continued to exercise all royal prerogatives, including coinage. His mother and wife left him and followed Henry IV to Germany. According to Berthold of Reichenau's Chronicle That summer undertook an expedition into Hungary to help King Salomon, who also because of his insolent and shameful crimes had been deposed from his office by his father's brother sic and the other magnates of the kingdom, for whose counsels he cared little. , however, was able to achieve nothing of what he wished there, namely to restore Salomon. Finally, bringing back his sister, Queen Judith, the wife of Salomon, he returned home to Worms Solomon attempted to convince Pope Gregory VII to support him against Geza. However, the pope condemned him for having accepted his kingdom as a fief from the king of the Germans and claimed suzerainty over Hungary. Thereafter it was Henry IV's support which enabled Solomon to resist Geza's all attempts at taking Moson and Pressburg. The German monarch even sent one of his main opponents, Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt, into exile to Solomon in June 1076. Solomon's wife, Queen Judith, who was about to return to her husband, undertook to take the imprisoned bishop to Hungary, but the prelate managed to escape. Geza decided to start new negotiations with Solomon. However, he died on 25 April 1077 and his partisans proclaimed his brother, Ladislaus, king. The new king occupied Moson in 1079, thus Solomon could preserve only Pressburg. In 1080 or 1081, the two cousins concluded a treaty, according to which Solomon acknowledged Ladislaus as king in exchange for revenues sufficient to bear the expenses of a king . Solomon did not give up his ambitions even after his abdication. He was arrested for plotting against his cousin, then held in captivity in Visegrad. He was released on the occasion of the canonization of King St. Stephen and the blessed Emeric the confessor around 17 August 1083. According to Hartvik's Legend of King Saint Stephen, King Ladislaus ordered Solomon's release, because nobody could open the grave of the saintly king while Solomon was held in captivity. Having been liberated, Solomon first visited his wife in Regensburg, although she was not grateful for this , according to the nearly contemporaneous Bernold of St Blasien. From Germany, Solomon fled to the Cumans in fact Pechenegs, according to the historians Gyula Kristo and Pal Engelwho were dwelling in the regions east of the Carpathian Mountains and north of the Lower Danube. Solomon promised one of their chiefs, Kutesk, that he would give him the right of possession over the province of Transylvania and would take his daughter as wife if Kutesk and his people would help him to regain his throne. They invaded the regions along the Upper Tisza with a great multitude of the Cumans , but King Ladislaus routed and forced them to withdraw from Hungary. At the head of a large contingent of Dacians Hungarians , Solomon joined a huge army of Cumans and Pechenegs who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 1087. The Byzantines routed the invaders in the mountains of Bulgaria. Solomon seems to have died fighting in the battlefield, because Bernold of St. Blasien narrates that he died courageously after an incredible slaughter of the enemy after he bravely undertook an enterprise against the King of the Greeks in 1087. Reports of later sources prove that Solomon became the subject of popular legends. For instance, the Illuminated Chronicle writes that Solomon repented of his sins, so far as human understanding may reach after the battle, and passed the last years of his life in pilgrimage and prayer, in fastings and watchings, in labour and contrition . According to these sources, Solomon died in Pula on the Istrian Peninsula where he was venerated as a saint. However, he was never officially canonized. His alleged tombstone is now in a local museum. Simon of Keza wrote in his Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum was now completely at a loss, and after returning to his queen at Admont he spent a few days with her before returning to Szekesfehervar in monk's habit. There, the story goes, his brother sic Ladislas was distributing alms to the poor with his own hands on the porch of the church of the Blessed Virgin, and Solomon was among the recipients. When Ladislas looked closely he realised who it was. After the distribution was over Ladislas made careful inquiries. He intended Solomon no harm, but Solomon assumed he did, and quit Szekesfehervar, making for the Adriatic. There he passed the rest of his days in complete poverty in a city named Pula he died in destitution and was buried there, never having returned to his wife. Solomon's wife, Judith, who was born in 1048, was the third daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife, Agnes de Poitou. Their wedding took place in Szekesfehervar in June 1063. The marriage remained childless. They first separated from each other around 1075. According to Bernold of St. Blasien, neither Solomon nor his wife had kept the marriage contract on the contrary, they had not been afraid, in opposition to the apostle, to defraud each other. Having been informed on Solomon's death, Judith married Duke Wadysaw I Herman of Poland in 1088. In contrast with all contemporaneous sources, the late 13th century Simon of Keza writes that Judith spurned all suitors after her husband's death, although many princes in Germany sought her hand . The following family tree presents Solomon's ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%2C%20King%20of%20Hungary
"SOLRAD SOLar RADiation 3 was a solar X Ray satellite and electronic surveillance satellite, the third in the SOLRAD program. Developed by the United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory, it shared satellite space with and provided cover for the Navy's GRAB 2 Galactic Radiation And Background , a secret electronic surveillance program. The satellite was launched atop a Thor DM 21 Ablestar rocket on June 29, 1961 along with Transit 4A and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts Injun 1 satellite. After reaching orbit, SOLRAD 3 GRAB 2 and INJUN 1 separated from Transit 4A but not from each other. Though this reduced SOLRAD 3's data transmission ability by half, nevertheless, the satellite still returned valuable information regarding the sun's normal levels of X ray emissions. The SOLRAD experiment package also established that, during solar flares, the higher the energy of emitted X rays, the more disruption caused on the Earth's thermosphere and radio transmissions therein . The GRAB mission was also highly successful, returning so much data on Soviet air defense radar facilities that an automated analysis system had to be developed to process it all. The United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory NRL established itself as a player early in the Space Race with the development and management of Project Vanguard 195659 , America's first satellite program. After Vanguard, the Navy's next major goal was to use the observational high ground of Earth's orbit to survey Soviet radar locations and frequencies. This first space surveillance project was called GRAB , later expanded into the more innocuous backronym, Galactic Radiation and Background. As American space launches were not classified until late 1961, a co flying cover mission sharing satellite space was desired to conceal GRAB's electronic surveillance mission from its intended targets. The field of solar astronomy provided such cover. Since the invention of the rocket, astronomers had wanted to fly instruments above the atmosphere to get a better look at the sun. The Earth's atmosphere blocks large sections of sunlight's electromagnetic spectrum, making it impossible to study the sun's X ray and ultraviolet output from the ground. Without this critical information, it was difficult to model the sun's internal processes, which in turn inhibited stellar astronomy in general. 56 On a more practical level, it was believed that solar flares directly affected the Earth's thermosphere, disrupting radio communications. The Navy wanted to know when its communications were going to become unreliable or compromised. Sounding rockets had shown that solar output was unpredictable and fluctuated rapidly. A long term, real time observation platform above the Earth's atmosphere in other words, a satellite was required to properly chart the sun's radiation, determine its effects on the Earth, and correlate it with ground based observations of the sun in other wavelengths of light. 63 Thus, the SOLRAD project was conceived to address several NRL goals at once A dummy SOLRAD was successfully launched on April 13, 1960, and SOLRAD 1 went into orbit on June 22, 1960, becoming both the world's first surveillance satellite as GRAB 1 and the first satellite to observe the sun in X ray and ultraviolet light. SOLRAD 2, a duplicate of SOLRAD 1, was launched on November 30, 1960, but was lost when its booster flew off course and had to be destroyed. Like its two predecessors, SOLRADs 1 and 2, SOLRAD 3 GRAB 2 was a 51 cm diameter sphere based on the Vanguard 3 satellite. Unlike SOLRAD 1 and the abortive SOLRAD 2, the satellite's scientific package did not include Lyman alpha photometers. This is because it had been discovered since SOLRAD 2's failed launch that the ultraviolet radiation level remained constant during solar flares. Instead, SOLRAD 3 carried two X ray photometers designed to cover a greater range of wavelengths than the first SOLRAD. In addition to a photometer that, covered the same 2 8A range as the earlier SOLRADS, SOLRAD also carried one that measured the bandwidth from 8 14A. As was the case with most early automatic spacecraft, SOLRAD 2, though spin stabilized, lacked attitude control systems and thus scanned the whole sky with no source in particular. 13 So that scientists could properly interpret the source of the X rays detected by SOLRAD 2, the spacecraft carried a vacuum photocell to determine when the sun was striking its photometers and the angle at which sunlight hit them. 64 SOLRAD 3 GRAB 2 was significantly heavier than its predecessors 25 kg versus 19 kg for SOLRAD 1, 18 kg for SOLRAD 2 as its GRAB package included equipment for monitoring two radar frequencies rather than just one, as in prior flights. In addition to monitoring Soviet air defense radars in the S band 1,550 3,900 MHz , GRAB 2 could also detect long range air surveillance radars operating in the UHF band at around 500 MHz. SOLRAD 3 GRAB 2 was launched on June 29, 1961 at 04 22 UTC on a Thor DM 21 Ablestar rocket, along with Transit 4A and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts Injun 1 satellite from Cape Canaveral pad LC17B. Its course to orbit was more northerly than that of its predecessors to avoid the possibility of fragments falling on Cuba in the event of a mission failure as had happened with SOLRAD 2 . After reaching orbit, SOLRAD 3 GRAB 2 and INJUN 1 separated from Transit 4A but not from each other, causing them to rotate more slowly than planned. Moreover, because electro magnetic interference generated by the spacecraft prevented ground controllers from requesting data from both spacecraft at the same time, SOLRAD 3 GRAB 2's transmissions were limited to odd numbered days, INJUN's to even numbered days thus, data was only recovered for half of each satellite's lifetime. Nevertheless, the SOLRAD package on the satellite made several important findings. It established the Sun's normal X ray radiation levels during times of inactivity at levels below 14A in wavelength less than 5103 ergs cm2 sec . The satellite also found that the higher the hardness energy level of X rays emitted during solar flares, the greater the disturbances and microwave bursts in the thermosphere, both affecting radio communications. 6768 The GRAB 2 portion of the satellite began transmission of information on Soviet radars starting July 15, returning a large volume of information over the next fourteen months. As opposed to the cautious approach exercised by former President Eisenhower, President Kennedy did not require personal authorization for the satellite to receive and transmit collected data. As a result, data was collected quicker than analysts could process, and by October 1961, a new automated analysis system was implemented not only to process the backlog of existing data but also data from upcoming electronic surveillance flights and even the Air Force's SAMOS reconnaissance satellites. The SOLRAD GRAB series flew twice more both unsuccessful missions , finishing with the SOLRAD 4B mission launched April 26, 1962. Afterward, three more SOLRAD missions flew with GRAB's signals intelligence successor, Poppy, 1963 65. The final five SOLRAD satellites were stand alone scientific satellites, three of which were also given NASA Explorer program numbers. These flew from 1965 76. In all, there were thirteen operational satellites in the SOLRAD series. The GRAB program was declassified in 1998. SOLRAD 3 COSPAR 1961 015B is still in orbit as of January 2019 and its position can be tracked.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLRAD%203
"Little Solsbury Hill more commonly known as Solsbury Hill is a small flat topped hill and the site of an Iron Age hill fort. It is located above the village of Batheaston in Somerset, England. The hill rises to 625 feet 191 m above the River Avon, which is just over 1 mile 2 km to the south, and gives views of the city of Bath and the surrounding area. It is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The hill is one of several possible locations of the Battle of Badon and shows the remains of a medieval field system. Part of the hill was quarried in the 19th century. In 1930, it was acquired by the National Trust. The hill was the inspiration of the Peter Gabriel song Solsbury Hill , recorded in 1977. A small turf labyrinth was cut into the turf by protesters during the widening of the A46 in 1994. It is sometimes misspelled as Salisbury, or Solisbury, perhaps because of confusion with Salisbury Plain a plateau in southern England , or the city of Salisbury. Salisbury and Solsbury can be difficult to distinguish in speech Salisbury is often pronounced Saulsbury , and sometimes the a in Salisbury is pronounced as an o , and the i is elided, making the pronunciations of the two words practically identical. The name 'Solsbury' may be derived from the Celtic god Sulis, a deity worshipped at the thermal spring in nearby Bath. A geological map by Horace B Woodward in the back of the 1888 'Handbook of Bath' labels the hill as 'Stilisbury Hill'. The hill is formed in layers from a variety of sedimentary rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising from the edge of the valley floor alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip. The 625 feet 191 m high hill is just over 1 mile 2 km to the north of the River Avon. Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. Solsbury Hill was an Iron Age hill fort occupied between 300 BC and 100 BC, comprising a triangular area enclosed by a single univallate rampart, faced inside and out with well built dry stone walls and infilled with rubble. The rampart was 20 feet 6 m wide and the outer face was at least 12 feet 4 m high. The top of the hill was cleared down to the bedrock, then substantial huts were built with wattle and daub on a timber frame. After a period of occupation, some of the huts were burnt down, the rampart was overthrown, and the site was abandoned, never to be reoccupied. This event is probably part of the Belgic invasion of Britain in the early part of the 1st century BC. The hill is near the Fosse Way Roman Road as it descends Bannerdown hill into Batheaston on its way to Bath. Solsbury Hill is a possible location of the Battle of Badon, fought between the Britons under the legendary King Arthur and the Saxons c. 496, mentioned by the chroniclers Gildas and Nennius. The hilltop also shows the remains of a medieval or post medieval field system. The hill also has two disused quarries, one listed on the northwest side on a 1911 map, and another one listed between 1885 and 1900 as an old quarry on the west side. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1930. People protesting against the building of an A46 bypass road cut a small turf maze into the hill, during the construction of the bypass in the mid 1990s. In one day of protests, 11 people, including George Monbiot, were hospitalised as a result of beatings by the security guards. The plants and animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat provided by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist plants and animals, some of which are rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow Achillea millefolium , and scabious. It is one of a series of flower rich habitats that Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including the six spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard Buteo buteo nest in the area. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus , badger and red fox are seen. Skylarks also nest on the hill. Solsbury Hill is also the inspiration for an eponymous song, released in 1977 by rock musician Peter Gabriel as his first solo single. A recording of the natural sounds on the hill forms the track A Quiet Moment on Gabriel's 2011 album New Blood, which precedes the orchestral version of his song. The Warlord Chronicles, a historical fiction trilogy of books, places the site of Mount Badon at Solsbury Hill.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solsbury%20Hill
"Solstice The Quest for the Staff of Demnos, or simply Solstice, is a 1990 puzzle video game developed by Software Creations. It was published by Nintendo in Europe and CSG Imagesoft in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game focuses on the wizard Shadax's bid to defeat the evil baron Morbius and rescue Princess Eleanor, whom Morbius plans to sacrifice. Shadax aims to gather the six pieces of the titular Staff of Demnos hidden within the fortress of Kastlerock. The game's setting is non linear, and consists of 250 rooms, each with a particular puzzle to solve. Solstice is the first original game to be developed by Software Creations, which had previously only worked on converted titles between 8 bit consoles. The game features a musical score by Tim Follin, who has named the game's title track as his favourite among his compositions. It became one of his best known tracks. Solstice was received positively by critics for its puzzles and graphics, and the audio was singled out for praise. A sequel, titled Equinox, was released for the Super NES in 1993. Solstice is an isometric perspective puzzle game in which the player controls the wizard Shadax, who must navigate 250 rooms within the fortress Kastlerock and assemble the six pieces of the Staff of Demnos to defeat the baron Morbius and rescue the princess Eleanor. Shadax's basic abilities consist of jumping, and picking up and dropping objects. Early in the game, Shadax can obtain a pair of magic elfin boots that augment his jumping height. He is additionally equipped with a few beakers that can be used to store four different varieties of potions these potions can either grant temporary invincibility, destroy all moving objects in a room, freeze time, or make invisible objects visible. At the beginning of the game, the beakers can only hold up to two doses of a potion each, though upgrades can be obtained later on. Any number of potions can be cast simultaneously within a given room, but the spell s will only last as long as Shadax remains within that room any effects from the potion s will disappear when the room is vacated. Many of the fortress's rooms feature hazards such as floors covered in spikes, conveyor belts, vanishing bridges and tiles, and floating mines, and may also be inhabited by antagonistic creatures such as trolls, giant spiders and demons. The rooms often include movable blocks that can be found either lying on the floor or falling from above. These blocks can be used to move safely around the rooms and bypass enemies and hazards. Falling blocks can be frozen in mid air with the time freezing potion and be used as steps. There are also hovering crystal balls that can be pushed through the air and ridden as transportation, but cannot be picked up and carried. In some rooms, bombs can be detonated to create an entrance to a previously blocked off passageway, though the detonators are hidden within nearby rooms. Other rooms contain portals that provide the only access to certain rooms within the fortress. Some rooms can only be cleared or accessed after finding and using of one of four hidden magic keys. Extra lives can be obtained by collecting blue pointed hats scattered throughout the fortress. Although the screen only registers ten lives at one time, the player can continue to accumulate more lives from that point. The player can also collect coins that allow them to return to a certain room when all lives are lost instead of having to restart the game from the beginning. At any point in the game, the player can access a map that chronicles any room that they have entered and indicates all possible exits some of these exits appear on the map, but will not appear in game until a certain task is performed. Aside from the map, the player can view an inventory listing a percentage of the total number of rooms they have visited, as well as the total number of magic items they have found. On the eve of the winter solstice, Morbius the Malevolent kidnaps Eleanor, Princess of Arcadia, to sacrifice her ritually and become the Evil Baron of Darkness. Shadax the wizard, after witnessing the kidnapping, heads to Morbius' stronghold, the fortress Kastlerock, to rescue Eleanor. Once while researching Kastlerock in the Library of Arcadia to find a way to overthrow Morbius, Shadax learned of a secret entrance into Kastlerock and the whereabouts of the Staff of Demnos, an ancient weapon with the power to defeat Morbius. The staff was hidden in Kastlerock because that was where Morbius would least expect to find it. Morbius' spies searched for the Staff but did not find it because it was broken into six pieces and made invisible. However, every one hundred years on the winter solstice, all six pieces become visible. Knowing a way in, Shadax enters Kastlerock to reassemble the Staff of Demnos, overthrow Morbius' forces of darkness, and save Princess Eleanor. Upon restoring the Staff of Demnos, Shadax seeks out and frees Eleanor from imprisonment and destroys Morbius with the Staff. The development of Solstice was initiated by the programmer Mike Webb of Software Creations, who desired to create a Knight Lore style isometric title for the NES. Solstice is the first original game to be developed within the company, which had previously only developed converted titles between 8 bit consoles. Mark Wilson, having previously worked as a programmer and a graphics artist for the company, saw Webb's proposal as an opportunity to attempt the role of a video game designer. In spite of his personal dislike of isometric games up to that point, Wilson thought it sensible to create an isometric title as the company's first original work, as no such format had previously been attempted on the NES. Over the course of four weeks, Wilson designed the entire game as sketches and notes on paper, often within a McDonald's on Oxford Road. All the game's item positions and events were placed on a master map hand drawn on a very large sheet of graph paper, and were based on Wilson's understanding of what the player might think or need at any particular point. This detailed approach put Wilson at odds with Webb, who failed to see why such an amount of time would be taken to design a game as opposed to expediently inserting rooms into a map at random. At one point, Webb presented Wilson with an alternate map created by his girlfriend the previous night, which consisted of 255 randomly connected empty rooms. Out of guilt for their furious arguments and pleasure with the final product, Wilson would ultimately give Webb a co designer credit in the game's attract mode screens. Wilson would later regret this action during a subsequent interview with Wilson at MicroProse, one of the interviewers falsely identified Webb as the game's sole designer. During the game's early stages of development, the player character Shadax appeared as a nondescript purple rectangle the Shadax sprite was eventually designed by Wilson. In creating the game's setting and aesthetic, Wilson acknowledged the slim capacity for storytelling on Nintendo's cheapest available cartridge, and thus focused on the game's atmosphere, which he says traded on the simplest and most basic of fantasy ideas . On stylistic influences, Wilson stated that All of the usual suspects at that time probably should be included as sources, from Lord of the Rings to Excalibur. The game's music was composed by Tim Follin. The primary background music was made to be atmospheric and dark, while the opening theme was made to be powerful. On his approach to the score, Follin commented that the folk melody style he had previously used for Ghouls 'n Ghosts was particularly suited for Solstice due to the game's fantasy oriented title and setting. The title theme's changing moods and phases were an attempt by Follin to keep the track interesting Follin felt that the constant evolution required to keep music in general interesting was imperative in video game music due to its lack of vocals and performance at the time. During development, a colleague of Follin played for him several works of game composer Rob Hubbard, which convinced Follin that the technical boundaries of the contemporary generation of hardware have been reached, and refocused his attention from the score's technique to the composition. While Follin retrospectively identified the title theme to be his favourite among his own compositions, he felt that his work on the in game music could have been improved to be a lot more spacious and interesting , as it looped too short and became irritating quite quickly . The game's development spanned the course of 20 months. While Solstice was given an early demonstration to Nintendo, Software Creations owner Richard Kay grew impatient and quickly sold the game's North American publishing rights to CSG Imagesoft. After a response from Nintendo stating their desire to publish the title, Nintendo was given the publishing rights for all other regions, and the resulting contract with Nintendo would lead to other high profile NES and SNES games. Upon receiving the game's publishing rights, CSG demanded that Shadax be changed from a wizard to a bodybuilder in a loincloth. When Wilson refused to make the change, CSG then made the request that Shadax's beard in the cutscenes be shortened, and the alteration was made against Wilson's protest. The package art, designed by Carol Roy, was lambasted by Wilson as having nothing to do with the game that was written, and he deemed it inferior to a proposed cover created by Neal Sutton that had already been supplied to CSG. He also derided the instruction booklet written by CSG as a mass of illiterate and asinine drivel . Wilson spent the game's development time attempting to obtain a contract from Software Creations covering his work on Solstice, only to be given verbal promises about the percentage of the profits he would receive. Following the game's completion, these promises were casually broken, and Wilson would not receive any monetary gain from the title's sales. Wilson left Software Creations following this development, and struggled to obtain work for the next two years. Solstice was announced in April 1990, and was released in July 1990 in North America and Europe. CSG's advertisement campaign for Solstice in North America consisted of a photograph of what Wilson described as an oiled up bodybuilder with long hair wearing dayglo pink posing trunks , which he called embarrassingly bad . The first 5,000 customers to order Solstice from CSG Imagesoft received a free Player's Pak , consisting of an 8 mm video tape on the making of Solstice, a player's score card, trading cards and colored stickers. Solstice was featured in the 1990 Nintendo World Championships. Solstice was met with a positive critical reception upon release. Richard Leadbetter of Computer and Video Games described the gameplay as excellent, with some brain bending puzzles and nice power ups for Shadax's abilities . Paul Glancey, also of Computer and Video Games, described Solstice as a BIG game with an awful lot of secrets to discover , and compared the game's puzzles to those of Knight Lore. Julian Rignall of Mean Machines also made a positive comparison to Knight Lore and noted that some of the puzzles were very devious . However, Matt Regan, also of Mean Machines, stated that while Solstice is a challenging game that puzzle fans should find interesting , the excitement fades as shifting blocks to stand on or to prevent the attacks of a nasty becomes boring . While Marc Camron and Ed Semrad of Electronic Gaming Monthly respectively considered the game to be unique and a refreshing change of pace from all of the me too type puzzle games , the publication's four reviewers collectively found the controls difficult and awkward. Robin Wyles of Raze compared the game's visuals and gameplay to those of Cadaver, and saw Solstice as an admirable attempt to relive the Knight Lore days that was quite refreshing in the face of the NES's lack of isometric perspective titles. However, he argued that the game's quantity of puzzles negatively impacted their variety, and felt that the puzzles were a bit too easy to solve, which reduces its long term appeal . Leadbetter described the graphics as excellent throughout, with some of the best backdrops and sprites ever seen in this type of game , and Glancey also felt the game's graphics were really lovely . Rignall, Regan and Semrad described the graphics as great , and Steve Harris and Ken Sushi X Williams of EGM said the game was beautiful . While Wyles appreciated the game's isometric perspective, he saw the colour schemes as unimaginative . The game's score was singled out for praise. Leadbetter proclaimed that the renowned Tim Follin comes up trumps yet again with some brilliant atmospheric scores , and both he and Glancey, along with Rignall, considered the soundtrack to be some of the best they had heard on the NES. Regan described the game's soundtrack as moody and atmospheric , and Semrad called the music fantastic . Wyles, however, described the sound effects as ropey and the in game background music as mediocre . The title theme in particular became one of Follin's best known tracks in retrospect. Brett Elston of GamesRadar proclaimed that if any 8 bit song could take you on a journey, this is it. From its modest, almost hobbit like opening to its soaring jig halfway through, the title screen music tramples over all other NES music. He additionally described the game's primary background track as considerably more mellow but no less proficient and listenable , and preferred its presence as in game music because there's no way I could play ANYTHING with that title screen going nuts . Nate Andrews of Nintendo World Report said that the regality of the opening track provides a fantastic build up for the ensuing blast, which nearly forces you to take a knee under its spectacle before dropping into extended, kicking jig, then moving into the rest of the prog y soundtrack . Layton Shumway of VentureBeat remarked that the theme sounds like a lost track from a Yes album and that it psyches you out with its single note fanfare intro, instantly kicks into high gear with cascading synth lines, then settles into a propulsive 6 8 rock beat . A sequel to Solstice, titled Equinox, was announced on January 1992, initially for a summer release that year, and was released for the Super NES on November 1993. The game's plot centers on Shadax's son Glendaal, who must rescue Shadax from his treacherous apprentice Sonia. The game consists of 450 rooms split between eight dungeons, and also features an isometric perspective, but includes a rotatable camera that incorporates Mode 7 effects. Tim Follin reprised his role as composer and was joined in this duty by his brother Geoff. Equinox was released to generally positive critical reception.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice%20%281990%20video%20game%29
"Solta pennant number OB 02 is a Mirna class patrol boat in service with the Croatian Navy. Completed during the 1980s as Mukos PC 176 , it was the sixth ship of a class that was being built for the Yugoslav Navy in the Kraljevica Shipyard. During the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of a tactical group tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the city of Split. On 14 November 1991, Croatian Navy commandos disabled the vessel with an improvised torpedo, leaving the vessel drifting and abandoned by her crew. The crippled ship was then tugged away by Croatian locals to the nearby island of Solta. She was subsequently repaired and entered service with the Croatian Navy as Solta. As of 2014, Solta remains in service with the Croatian Coast Guard, an integral part of the navy. Solta was laid down as Mukos PC 176 in the Kraljevica Shipyard as the sixth ship in a class of patrol boats that were being built for the Yugoslav Navy JRM . It was launched on 18 November 1982. She measures 32 m 105 ft in length, has a draught of 2.7 m 8.9 ft , a 6.75 m 22.1 ft beam and a standard displacement of 125 tonnes 123 long tons or 142 tonnes 140 long tons when full. Powered by two SEMT Pielstick 12PA4 200VGDS diesel engines that spin two propellers, Solta has a maximum speed of 29.530 knots 54.655.6 km h 33.934.5 mph and a continuous speed of 28 knots 52 km h 32 mph . She has a range of 600 nautical miles 1,100 km 690 mi at 15 knots 28 km h 17 mph and an autonomy of four to five days that can be extended to eight days during wartime. The ship's original armament consisted of a single Bofors 40 mm D70 gun mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple Strela 2 launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20 mm M 75 gun on the stern. Eight MDB MT3 depth charges could be carried for anti submarine warfare duties. Located on the sides were two double barrel 128 mm illumination launchers. Sensors included a Racal Decca RM 1216 A surface search radar and a Simrad SQ 3D SF sonar. During its service in the Yugoslav Navy, Mukos was part of the border patrol detachment. In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of the Kastela tactical group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the port of Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17 30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Brac and Solta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy HRM , effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The HRM command constructed the torpedo from a small outboard motor boat loaded with explosives. A former missile technician from the Yugoslavian navy had, while receiving training on Saab missiles in Sweden, picked up some remote control plane parts in a hobby store. Handed over to HRM, the gear yielded the ability to remotely control the unmanned vessel. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to flood and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a Shershen class torpedo boat Pionir II TC 224 while Mukos itself was left adrift. During the evening of 15 November the ship was tugged away by a Croatian fishing ship to the nearby Necujam cove, where the vessel was beached to prevent her from sinking. In the early hours of the same day, the remaining JRM ships opened fire in retaliation for damaging Mukos. As Yugoslav forces left the area, the ship was towed to an overhauling shipyard in Sibenik on the night of 17 18 November, after being salvaged by HRM divers with the help of Brodospas. The ship was repaired and renamed Solta, entering service with the HRM on 15 May 1992 with Mile Tomas in command. The Croatian Coast Guard was formed in October 2007, and Solta was assigned to the 1st Division, based in Split. During the same year the ship underwent a modernisation that included the installation of a new Sperry Marine radar, gyrocompass and GPS. A second refit that occurred sometime between 2007 and 2013 included the deletion of the Strela launcher and the stern 20 mm M 75 gun to create space needed for a RHIB and a hydraulic crane used to lower it into the sea. The pennant number was changed from OB 62 to OB 02.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian%20patrol%20boat%20%C5%A0olta%20%28OB-02%29
"Soma Bringer is an action role playing game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. The player, controlling one of the eight main characters, explores dungeons and fights enemies in real time combat across three dimensional plains from a top down perspective. Multiplayer functions allow up to three players to participate in exploration and combat. The story focuses on the continent of Barnea the principle magical energy, Soma, is being disrupted by the arrival of monsters called Visitors, prompting a military group called Pharzuph Division 7 to defeat the Visitors and restore the balance of Soma. Soma Bringer was the creation of producer and studio co founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role playing game before transitioning to action role playing due to hardware restrictions, the aim was to create an engaging multiplayer experience this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, a reversal of the development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years. First announced in October 2007, Soma Bringer was the first portable title to be fully developed by Monolith Soft, and the first released by the studio since their acquisition by Nintendo. The game was released in Japan in February 2008, and has remained exclusive to the region. When released, it was critically acclaimed by both Japanese and Western journalists and sold strongly in Japan. Western journalists drew positive comparisons with the Mana and Diablo series. Soma Bringer is an action role playing game where players take control of members of a military unit dubbed Pharzuph Division 7. The three dimensional environments are explored from a top down perspective, and the overhead camera can be zoomed in and out on the playable character. Seven characters are available at the start of the game, with an eighth being unlocked later on. The game uses two modes of play. In single player, the player controls the party leader while the two assigned companions are controlled using the game's artificial intelligence. In addition to the single player mode, the game features cooperative co op multiplayer. Activated through wireless connection, up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons. Battles take place in real time within the same space as exploration, which include overworld environments and dedicated dungeons. Using a style similar to hack and slash, the three characters attack targeted enemies in the field. Abilities, including standard attacks and special moves related to a character, are mapped to the Nintendo DS DS face buttons. Attacks can be chained together into combinations for higher damage. Continually attacking an enemy will cause a Break , a period where the enemy is stunned and attacks cause more damage. Gameplay is not paused when the separate item menu is opened, which contains items such as regenerative potions. Character health is automatically replenished when they move into a new area, otherwise needing items to restore. There are six different specialized combat roles equivalent to standard character classes. They are Battlers warriors , Dark dark knights , Gunners, Kanbus ninja , Koas paladins , and Somas mages . A character's class determines what types of weapons and skills they can equip. Each class consequently uses a different fighting style the Kanbus focuses on dual weapons and one hit attacks, the Koas focuses on a combination of attack and healing abilities, the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long range magic over close range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. Weapons and items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through wireless connection. Through combat and quest completion, characters gain experience points, which raise experience level. When the main character is killed in battle, the party respawns at the nearest town, and a headstone appears where they fell which contains some of the experience points gained during battles up to that point. Experience points are lost with each death, although the character does not lose experience levels. Other playable characters raise experience levels quicker depending on the player character's own level. Upon each level up, a character is granted three statistic points, which can be distributed by the player to increase a character attribute these include maximum health. Ability points are also given, which are allocated to skills related to different weapons and abilities such as spells and passive buffs and debuffs. These skills are maxed out at Level 20. Soma Bringer is set on the continent of Barnea, which is part of a world where the energy of everyday life is drawn from Soma, a mystical power that fills the atmosphere, forming the so called Soma Ring around the planet through a special conversion process, it is used for everything from ordinary appliances to advanced weaponry. At some point prior to the game's opening, mysterious monsters called Visitors began appearing taking the form of corrupted animal and plant life, they began attacking human settlements. To combat the Visitors, the controlling organization in charge of regulating Soma usage Secundady created a dedicated military force called the Pharzuph. The main narrative follows new and veteran members of Pharzuph Division 7, who set out to investigate and combat a recent spate of Visitor attacks. During the mission, the group come across Idea, an amnesiac girl with latent and highly attuned Soma related abilities. She is assigned to Pharzuph Division 7 by their leader Master Laban. During their continued missions against Visitors, Pharzuph Division 7 are confronted by the Unbras, a group with similar powers to Idea and whose leader Adonis seeks Master Cages, Soma condensing devices connected to the origins of Soma technology. As the group travels, they discover that Adonis and the Master Cages are linked to the origin of Soma. Soma is the energy of life, the harnessing of which was granted to humans by the extraterrestrial Arethia existing in legend as a false god banished through the use of Soma, the Arethia was actually a non physical collective consciousness that traded use of human bodies for technical knowledge that allowed humans to thrive. The Arethia were eventually betrayed by humanity robbed of the ability to use physical hosts after a vicious war, the Arethia consciousness was imprisoned beyond the atmosphere in the Soma Ring, in truth an orbital ring controlled from the Ring Tower in the ancient human citadel of Cremona. Imprisoning the Arethia allowed humanity free use and control of Soma energy. A weakness eventually appeared in the Ring's containment field and some of the Arethia consciousness escaped. Corrupted by the journey to the surface, the formerly benign energy mutated and infected other lifeforms with a mindless wish for self preservation, becoming the Visitors. Both Idea and Adonis were created using Master Cages as weapons during the conflict, though they were only awakened in the present. Only Adonis fully awoke while Idea suffered an incomplete awakening when found by Pharzuph Division 7 and regressed to a childlike amnesiac state. In addition, Master Laban has been using Pharzuph Division 7 to gain access to the Master Cages so he could stop Adonis and continue the use of Soma energy by destroying the Arethia consciousness. Welt, a new member of Pharzuph Division 7, is contacted by Orpheus, the avatar of the Arethia's true will. Orpheus asks Pharzuph Division 7 through Welt to stop both Laban and Adonis, the latter wishing to bring destruction upon mankind for its treatment of the Arethia. Upon confronting Adonis after traveling to the Soma Ring via the Ring Tower, Pharzuph Division 7 defeat the incarnation of the deranged Arethia energies with Welt's help, Adonis, Idea, and Orpheus stabilize the Soma flow and pacify the Visitors. Welt is returned to his comrades, but Orpheus, Adonis, and Idea must leave to merge with the Arethia along with the Visitor energies. Soma Bringer was the brainchild of Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the co founders of developer Monolith Soft. It was the first time Monolith Soft had full development responsibilities for a game on a portable platform. The game took approximately two years to develop Takahashi's aim was to create an in depth introductory role playing experience for the DS. The DS was chosen as the game's platform so people could both enjoy the game and play it for short bursts on the go. The story was written by Takahashi's wife Soraya Saga, whose previous work included Final Fantasy VI 1994 , Xenogears 1998 , and the Xenosaga series. Due to the goal of creating a fun co op gameplay experience, Saga deliberately kept the story simple and clear not to interrupt the fun of playing . The narrative was based around the titular energy Soma , which was a key part of everyday life, with the Soma Ring encircling the planet forming a key part of the story. Also among the staff were director Shingo Kawabata, art director Tonny Waiman Koo, and character designer Tadahiro Usuda. Takahashi acted as game designer. At the beginning of development, Soma Bringer was to be a standard role playing game. During early testing, it was seen that typical role playing games were not well suited to the DS' limited hardware and controls, so they adjusted the gameplay to its current form as an action role playing game. After positive feedback from this, the team went ahead. The move to being an action role playing game enabled the incorporation of cooperative multiplayer the team wanted to focus as much as possible on the combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles. Rather than a separate mode, multiplayer was incorporated into the main story. The development cycle differed greatly from previous Monolith Soft titles. In Takahashi's earlier games, the scenario was written first then the gameplay was tailored to fit. For Soma Bringer, the gameplay was finalized first, and the scenario was built around the locations, dungeons, and mechanics the team had created. Also in contrast to earlier Monolith Soft titles was the lack of lengthy cutscenes, which could not be incorporated into the game with the DS' limited hardware. Instead, the team used the real time graphics and gameplay models for equivalent scenes. The music for Soma Bringer was composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, whose previous notable work included titles such as Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Chrono Cross, and Xenosaga Episode I. Mitsuda was involved from the very beginning of development, as Takahashi did not want to work on a game without Mitsuda's music. Mitsuda accepted due to their past work on Xenogears and Xenosaga, considering it a kind of reunion. Mitsuda's music formed a key part in compensating for the lack of proper cutscenes, as the music made up for any lack in dramatic character movement during story sequences. Due to the gameplay being created first, Mitsuda had difficulty pinning down what he had to do, and wrote songs for the soundtrack based on the gradually emerging visuals and scenario. Mitsuda estimated that he had written around one hundred songs for the game including test tracks. The opening vocal track, titled Ring , was written for the opening movie and set to a piece of poetry written by Takahashi to portray the themes of the game, Mitsuda used three female vocalists, Eri Kawai, Koko Komine, and Tamie Hirose, and recorded in a multiplexer to produce as clear a sound as possible. Kawai also performed vocal work for the track Destruction . For each of the location themes, Mitsuda used a different primary instrument to create an impression for instance, for a desert location, he used a sitar, while a location dominated by machinery used electric guitar. All the instrument sounds were created using a synthesizer. Mitsuda and his team spent the first year of the game's development studying the DS hardware, which had notoriously bad sound quality and brought with it severe technical difficulties in creating a soundtrack of a similar caliber to Mitsuda's previous work the main limitations were the speaker limits and limited memory capacity. Part of the difficulty in composing the music was creating different mixes for the soundtrack depending on whether the player selected the built in speakers or the headphones. According to Mitsuda, the speakers and the headphones had very different hertz outputs, meaning it was impossible to maintain the same quality for both settings. The end result was described by Mitsuda as a much better sound quality with a lesser amount of data . Two key people cited by Mitsuda in overcoming these barriers were sound programmer Hidenori Suzuki and synthesizer operator Junya Kuroda. Kuroda came up with multiple techniques for improving the sound quality, a task which had been so infuriating for Mitsuda that he came close to giving up multiple times. According to Kuroda, the main difficulty was not a lack of techniques for creating a clean sound for the DS, but applying them to the music of Soma Bringer, which was more ambitious than many other soundtracks for the platform. The result of using their own technology meant that, after adjustment and balancing, the tracks were very close to the original tracks prior to being incorporated into the game and DS sound environment. Suzuki worked on the dedicated sound driver, and Mitsuda appraised him with achieving a clean sound for the opening track. A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was released through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5 5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer noted that it often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review by saying that it was a soundtrack not to be missed by buyers of video game music. The existence of Soma Bringer was first hinted at when Nintendo filed a trademark for the title alongside others. It was officially announced in October that year at a Nintendo press conference. Published by Nintendo, Soma Bringer was the first Monolith Soft title to be released after its acquisition by Nintendo in April 2007. It was released on February 22, 2008. After positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in Japan, both IGN and 1UP.com voiced a hope that the game would receive a localization. Speaking in 2010, Saga said that she did not know whether it would be released outside Japan, or whether further games set in the Soma Bringer universe would be developed. Ultimately, Soma Bringer was not released outside Japan no explanation was given by Nintendo, although there was some speculation that its high text content was to blame. Its exclusivity to Japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists, in addition to continued hope for a Western release an article from IGN cited the release of Glory of Heracles as a possible precursor to a Western release, while gaming site Siliconera reported that Nintendo might release it in the West during the transitional phase between the DS and its successor the Nintendo 3DS, although the writer noted that Soma Bringer's text heavy approach made it more difficult and thus less appealing to localize. To date, it remains exclusive to Japan. An unofficial open fan translation patch was created while not complete, it translated the greater majority of text into English. Soma Bringer entered the Japanese sales charts at 4 with sales of 50,844 units, with an estimated sell through rate of just over 68 . The limited edition was the best selling DS title during its opening week on Amazon Japan. By the following week, the game had dropped to 7 with further sales of 17,000 units. By the end of 2008, the game had sold 107,127 units. Famitsu gave the game a positive review while one reviewer noted that the story and gameplay offered little originality, all reviewers positively noted the amount of depth and customization next to the ease of play. GamesRadar compared Soma Bringer to Square Enix's Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, except noting that the gameplay systems and customization options were deeper. The reviewer called it pretty good , but noted that it was not import friendly due to the large amount of text. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer was generally positive about the game, praising the character customization, general gameplay, ease of entry, and Mitsuda's music. Like the GamesRadar reviewer, Moehnke noted the heavy amount of text making understanding Japanese a necessity for understanding the story, despite calling it a fairly easy import as the story was not the game's main focus. Siliconera writer Rolando again echoed the necessity for understanding Japanese due to the game's text heavy nature while noting the plot was quite simple and in common with other Monolith Soft titles, but otherwise generally praised the gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer would be fun despite the lack of WiFi functionality. In conclusion, he positively compared Soma Bringer to console turn based role playing game Lost Odyssey while it brought nothing new to the genre, it was a nostalgic experience that reminded players of the genre's worth. English previews positively compared the gameplay to the Mana series, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from the Diablo series. These comparisons were also shared by other reviewers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma%20Bringer
"Somalia sent a delegation to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia from 15 September to 1 October 2000. This was the African country's fifth appearance at a Summer Olympic Games, following their debut twenty eight years earlier at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation consisted of two athletics competitors Ibrahim Mohamed Aden and Safia Abukar Hussein, the latter was Somalia's first female Olympic athlete. Neither of the two participants progressed beyond the first round of their respective competitions. The Somali Olympic Committee was recognised by the International Olympic Committee IOC on 1 January 1972. The nation debuted that year in the 1972 Summer Olympics. Somalia participated in an African boycott over New Zealand's participation at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and joined a United States led boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It did not compete again until the 1984 Summer Olympics. Somalia forewent the 1992 Summer Olympics, possibly because of the ongoing famine affecting the country it had participated in the opening ceremony. This made Sydney their fifth appearance at a Summer Olympic Games. Somalia took part in the 2000 Summer Olympics from 15 September to 1 October 2000. The delegation consisted of athletics competitors Ibrahim Mohamed Aden and Safia Abukar Hussein. Because of financial difficulties, Somali businesspersons contributed capital to the group. The nation was granted permission from the IOC to compete in the Olympics and the ruling body paid for the majority of the team's air travel to Sydney. The athletes were viewed by the media as having little opportunity to win Somalia's first medal. Aden was the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Ibrahim Mohamed Aden was 27 years at the time of the Sydney Games. He was competing in his second Olympic Games after the 1996 Summer Olympics. Because no other competitor could venture outside of Somalia to meet the required Olympic qualifying standards via a top level international event, Aden was the sole Somali sportsperson to qualify for the Games. On 25 September, he took part in the first round heats of the men's 1500 metres and was assigned to compete in heat three. Aden completed the race in 3 minutes and 40.33 seconds, twelfth out of fourteen athletes in his heat, and 20th overall. He was therefore eliminated because he was 0.58 seconds behind the slowest qualifier in his heat who progressed to the semi finals. Competing at her first Summer Olympiad, Safia Abkhar Hussein was 19 years old, and was Somalia's first female Olympic athlete. This was problematic due to the perception of women in athletes within Somalia. Hussein's father disliked the idea over a concern of his that it would prevent her from finding a husband. Nevertheless, he subsequently allowed her to compete in Sydney. On 22 September, Hussein participated in the first round heats of the women's 400 metres. Drawn to the third heat, she finished the race in a time of 1 minute and 13.25 seconds, place sixth and last out of all runners in her heat. She was 57th and last overall and her time was insufficient to advance to the quarter finals because she was 20.60 seconds slower than the slowest runner in her heat to progress to the next round.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics
"Somalia sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The country's participation at Beijing marked its seventh in the Summer Olympics since its debut in 1972 Games. The delegation included two track and field athletes sprinter Samiya Yuusf Omar and long distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim. Neither athlete progressed past the first round of their respective competitions. Omar's story, having trained in Mogadishu during the Somali Civil War, was covered by the media at the time, and later featured in a graphic novel following her death. Somalia participated in seven Summer Olympics between its debut in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The highest number of Somalis participating at any single Summer Games was seven at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, United States. No Somali has ever won a medal at an Olympics. Abdinasir Said Ibrahim was chosen to compete in the Men's 5000 metres and Samiya Yuusf Omar in the Women's 200 metres. Somali official Duran Farah was chosen as the nation's flag bearer for the Parade of Nations. Somalia was represented by one male athlete at the 2016 Games in athletics Abdinasir Said Ibrahim, a 5000 metres runner, an 18 year old. He competed in the third and final heat of the first round, with a time of 14 21 58. This placed him in 12th and final place, over sixteen seconds behind Abdelaziz El Idrissi of Morocco in 11th position. However, there were two runners slower than Ibrahim in other heats Nader al Masri of Palestine and Soe Min Thu of Myanmar. At the age of 16 years old, Samiya Yuusf Omar was the only female athlete competing for Somalia at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Prior to the competition, she trained at the Mogadishu Stadium on a gravel track pitted by mortar craters. She explained that she would be routinely harassed while training by local militia groups, fighting in the Somali Civil War, and both friends and family had been pressuring her to stop training. She explained, Traditionally Somalis view the girls as corrupted if they join in with things like sports and music. It's because they sometimes wear transparent clothes or shorts. Therefore I have been coming under pressure from all different sides. She continued to practice following encouragement from her mother, although had not expected to be chosen for the Games due to her age and as she was from a minority ethnic group. She competed in the fifth out of six heats of the women's 200 metre competition on 19 August. She finished in a time of 32.16 in eighth and last place, nine seconds behind South African Isabel Le Roux in seventh position. Having had no funding, Omar competed in loose fitting equipment donated by the Sudanese team, but despite finishing in last place, the media coverage of her meant that she was cheered loudly by the crowd as she finished. Following the Games, she received death threats upon returning to Somalia, and after being confronted by Al Shabaab, she began to deny that she was an athlete. The organisation banned woman from participating in sports, and Omar eventually made her way to Ethiopia in order to pursue the hope of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She attempted to make her way to Europe, travelling to Libya in September 2011. Alongside other refugees, she attempted to cross the Mediterranean by sea in 2012 she drowned while attempting to board an Italian naval vessel when the boat she was on was intercepted off the coast of Libya. Omar's life story was later dramatised as the graphic novel An Olympic Dream The story of Samia Yusuf Omar by German artist Reinhard Kleist.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics
"Somalia participated at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom, which took place from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The country's participation in London marked its ninth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation included one short distance sprinter and one long distance runner Mohamed Hassan Mohamed and Zamzam Mohamed Farah. Both qualified for the games through wildcard places from the International Association of Athletics Federations. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. Mohamed and Farah failed to advance beyond the heat stage of their respective events. Somalia participated in nine summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. The country did not participate in the 1976 Summer Olympics and 1980 Summer Olympics due to boycotts relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa earlier in 1976 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan respectively. The nation also did not compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics, despite participating in the opening ceremony, because of the ongoing famine affecting the country. The highest number of Somalis participating at any single Summer Games was seven at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, United States. No Somali athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympic Games but the country's best performance came at the 1996 Summer Olympics when Abdi Bile finished sixth in the men's 1500 metres. Somalia participated in the London Summer Games from 27 July to 12 August 2012. Somalia received universality places a wildcard for athletes who have not attained qualification standards from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to represent Somalia at the London Games were Mohamed Hassan Mohamed in the men's 1500 metres and Zamzam Mohamed Farah in the women's 400 metres. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by chef de mission Omar Barajab. The athletes' training at Mogadishu Stadium and in the city's roads which was for six days a week was hampered by the death of the country's National Olympic Committee NOC president Aden Yabarow Wiish in a suicide bombing in April 2012, but their coach Ahmed Ali encouraged the runners not to let the event influence their training. Both competitors were not confirmed until July 2012 because the NOC did not wish to jeopardise their safety by making them targets. Long distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim had been due to compete but withdrew because of extreme stress caused by unsafe roads which lowered his mental morale. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. Mohamed was the youngest person to represent Somalia at the London Games at the age of 18. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. In an interview with The Guardian before the Games, Mohamed said he wanted people to see a Somali athlete competing at the Olympics and wanted to influence the international community's view of his country away from being a nation afflicted by war and without any development. He wanted to win a medal because of his long training routine. Mohamed was drawn in the men's 1500 metres second heat on 3 August, finishing 13th out of 14 athletes, with a time of three minutes and 46.16 seconds. He finished ahead of Yemen's Nabil Al Garbi three minutes and 55.46 seconds but behind Jamale Aarrass of France three minutes and 45.13 seconds in a heat led by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Shaween three minutes and 39.42 seconds . Overall Mohamed placed 38th out of 43 participants, and did not progress into the semi finals after finishing 6.21 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who made the later stages. At the age of 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was the only female athlete competing for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, she said that she was very much excited to compete at the Games I hope I will win, inshahAllah . That is what I am expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia. Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil 53.43 seconds and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko 53.66 seconds in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States 50.78 seconds . Farah finished 45th and last out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages.

Somalia received universality slots from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2014, the Somali Olympic Committee appointed a team of professionals to find talented Somali athletes for the upcoming Summer Olympics. Efforts were hampered by the ongoing Somali Civil War, both in access for the scouts and because athletes were fleeing the fighting. Samia Yusuf Omar, who represented the national at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, drowned off the Libyan coast while attempting to reach Europe by boat in 2012. Maryan Nuh Muse was chosen to compete in the women's 400 metres and Kenyan born Mohamed Daud Mohamed in the men's 5000 metres.

Muse had previously competed on behalf of Somalia at international youth athletic competitions around the world. Prior to the competition, she spoke of the difference in the quality of the training facilities in Somalia compared to those in other countries, saying A number of countries will be participating among them Jamaica and United States but I am hoping to shine. We dont have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. I know they are determined to win but we are also equally determined.

The country's participation in Rio marked its debut appearance in the quadrennial event, although it had competed in the Summer Olympics nine times since the 1972 Games. The delegation consisted of a single middle distance runner, Farhan Adawe, who qualified for the Games by meeting qualification standards in March 2016. He was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and came ninth overall in his event, the men's 100 metres T52 , which led to his elimination from the Paralympics. Somalia had first competed in the Olympic Games at the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany. They participated on nine occasions prior to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where they made their Summer Paralympics debut in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with the exception of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa earlier in 1976, and the latter because the country joined the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the SovietAfghan War. The nation also did not compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics, despite participating in the opening ceremony, because of the ongoing famine affecting the country. Somalia was one of six countries to make their first appearance in the Paralympic Games the others were Aruba, Congo, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe and Togo. The country participated in the Rio Paralympic Games from 7 to 18 September 2016. The Somalia Paralympic Committee sent a single middle distance runner, Farhan Adawe, after the committee's secretary general Ali Ahmed Mohamud held discussions with Adawe about the opportunity to represent his country of which he accepted. A committee formed goalball team composed of blind athletes failed to qualify for the Games. Two other Somali nationals competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, but under the citizenships of other countries they were Abdi Dini, for Canada and Abdi Jama for Great Britain. Adawe was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness cerebral palsy wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories visual impairment, including blindness Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. Farhan Adawe was the first Somali Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event and was 19 years old at the time of the Games. After the International Paralympic Committee granted Somalia's entry into the Paralympics, they requested that the nation make Adawe go through the routine qualifying procedures for all para athletes. Adawe was placed in the T52 classification because his legs are unable to support him standing in an upright position and consequently used a wheelchair. He qualified for the Games by meeting qualification standards in an tournament held in Italy in March 2016 where he set a national record time of 18.83 seconds which was 1.67 seconds faster the standard qualifying time for the men's 100 metres T52 . Adawe was drawn in the contest's first heat on 9 September, finishing fifth out of eight competitors, with a time of 18.49 seconds.

"Somari is a side scrolling platform video game, originally released in 1994 for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES . An unlicensed port of Sega's 1991 Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog, the game was sold primarily around Asia, Russia, and other regions where pirate NES cartridges were distributed. Like the original, players venture to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Robotnik, who plots to turn the animal population of the fictional South Island into evil robots. Unlike the original, the game features Nintendo's mascot Mario as the main character rather than Sonic. The title is a portmanteau of Sonic and Mario . Somari was developed by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. Very little is known about the game's origins it is theorized to have been based on source code extracted from the original game and its sequel and back ported to the NES. The title has caught the attention of contemporary video game journalists, who have commented upon its accurate recreation of the original game. The gameplay and plot of Somari is substantially similar to that of the original Sonic the Hedgehog. The game follows the player's quest to defeat Doctor Robotnik, who has converted all the animals of South Island into evil robots. However, the game features Mario as the main character, rather than Sonic. Mirroring Sonic's emphasis on speed, Mario can run at high speeds, although gameplay as a whole is slightly slower. Items, bosses, levels, and enemies are all identical to Sonic. Somari must collect 100 golden rings in order to enter the bonus stage at the end of the level, but being injured by enemies causes him to lose rings. 26 The game employs a timer as in Sonic, however regardless of what time is scored the player always gets a Time Bonus of 5000 points. As in Sonic, each level is divided into three acts, and the third act ends with a boss fight with Robotnik. Although Somari borrows the concepts for its game dynamics from the original Sonic the Hedgehog, the implementation of them differs in many ways. Unlike the original Sonic the Hedgehog game, the player character can use the spin dash feature first implemented in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 1992 . 26 Other notable differences include the fact that whereas Sonic would lose all his collected rings after being injured by an enemy, Mario always loses a maximum of 3 rings even when carrying a single ring. 27 Each area in Somari is taken from the original Sonic the Hedgehog game, borrowing many elements from the original stages, but some level layouts are completely new. Significantly, elements of level design from the Mario series, such as off screen secret areas high above the player's field of view, make appearances in certain areas. Somari was developed by the homebrew developer Hummer Team, though they are credited in game as Somari Team. The game's levels are based on the Sega Genesis version of the first Sonic game, with the exception of the Scrap Brain Zone, while the bonus stages are based on the Master System and Game Gear versions. The game features Sonic's Spin Dash, which was not introduced until Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The audio of the game is similar to the original, but suffers from a poor conversion to the NES's sound system. The word Somari is a portmanteau of Sonic and Mario . It is unknown precisely how, when, or where the game was created, though Asia is likely a Taiwanese trademark for Somari was registered on March 1, 1994. The game is thought to be based on source code extracted from the original Sonic the Hedgehog that was reverse engineered and ported from the Genesis to the NES. However, the movement of Mario is based on the mechanics and physics of the Sonic character from Sonic the Hedgehog 2, raising the possibility that it contains coding information from this game as well. The game was marketed in gaming magazines in Hong Kong and in Russia during the late 1990s, and it can be found today in the United States in specialized gaming stores. The game also remains a popular title for emulation. The concept of a crossover or mashup title bringing the popular video game characters Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog into one game had been a long running dream in video game culture. Although Somari does not feature both characters in the same game, the fact that Mario had been placed into the world of Sonic the Hedgehog was registered with astonishment. Russian gaming magazine Great Drakon scored the game 4 10 only 2 10 for sales volume and commented in a review that at last 8 bit console gamers could roughly gain the experience of 16 bit gaming as with Sonic. 26 Despite the similarities between Somari and the original game, reviewers were quick to point out the many differences between them. Commentators on the Russian TV program Dendy The New Reality stated that Somari for Dendy is not the same as Sonic for SEGA. ... Everything's different. Contemporary criticism of the game emphasized its difficulty relative to the original Sonic title, and the game was characterized as having complex controls although reviews claimed that these could be mastered in time . 26 GamesRadar listed Somari on their list of Crazy ass rom hacks , calling it Less mash up and more train wreck due to poor physics and unresponsive controls, and recommended that players instead purchase Super Smash Bros. Brawl if they wished for a crossover featuring Mario and Sonic. GameSpy, however, described the game as a remarkably good port hack of Sonic to the NES, and Atari HQ described it as amazing original with more than adequate level porting. 1UP.com considered it excellently coded for a homebrew NES game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somari
"Penny Marshall as Ms. Lucille Botz Some Enchanted Evening is the thirteenth and final episode of The Simpsons' first season. It was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 13, 1990. Written by Matt Groening and Sam Simon and directed by David Silverman and Kent Butterworth, Some Enchanted Evening was the first episode produced for season one and was intended to air as the series premiere in fall 1989, but aired as the season one finale due to animation issues. The Christmas special Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire premiered in its place on December 17, 1989. It is the last episode to feature the original opening sequence starting from Bart the Genius . In the episode, Homer and Marge go on a night out while leaving the children under the care of a diabolical babysitter named Ms. Botz. Penny Marshall provided the voice of Ms. Botz. The episode features cultural references to such films as The Night of the Hunter and Psycho as well as a musical reference to A Star Is Born. Since its initial broadcast, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.4, and was the highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Marge is depressed that Homer takes her for granted. She calls Dr. Marvin Monroe's radio call in therapy show. Homer, upon hearing the call on the radio at work, feels bad, goes to Moe's Tavern after work, and, on Moe's advice, brings home a rose and a box of chocolates. Marge's mood softens and Homer invites her to a dinner at a fancy restaurant, dancing, and a night at a motel. Marge and Homer hire Ms. Botz through a babysitting service to watch the kids. Ms. Botz puts Maggie to bed and has Bart and Lisa watch The Happy Little Elves. Bart and Lisa then learn from a TV show called America's Most Armed and Dangerous that Ms. Botz is actually a wanted burglar nicknamed The Babysitter Bandit . Realizing her cover is blown, Botz ties the kids up while packing the family's possessions into her suitcases. After Maggie awakes and frees Bart and Lisa, they knock out Ms. Botz with a baseball bat. Realizing Botz disabled the telephone line, the kids go to the police station and call the TV show. Marge and Homer, unable to reach them as a result, return home early to find Ms. Botz bound and gagged. Homer, unaware of the situation, frees her and pays her handsomely. She flees just as the kids arrive with the police and news reporters. Homer then realizes his mistake and lies about how he fought Botz, but could not stop her from escaping. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge says if he raised three children who can hogtie a stranger, then he must be doing something right. Even though this episode aired as the last episode of the first season, it was the first episode in production and was intended to be the first episode to air from the half hour show. The series is a spin off from The Tracey Ullman Show in which the family already appeared in a series of animated one minute shorts. The characters were already created, but had to be further developed in order to carry a half hour show. The episode was therefore meant as an introduction to the characters. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer producer Sam Simon of such television series as Cheers wrote the script for the episode. Both Groening and Simon are credited with developing the series along with executive producer James L. Brooks. The name Ms. Botz was based on a real person who had once babysat Groening. The episode was first directed by Kent Butterworth. Klasky Csupo, the animation studio that produced the earlier Simpsons shorts, was in charge of the animation, with one exception. During the years of producing the shorts, everything was created in house. As a budgetary consideration, production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM. While character and background layout was done in Los Angeles, inbetweening, coloring and filming is done by the overseas studio. A debacle erupted when this episode, the first to return from Korea, was screened in front of the production staff at the Gracie Films bungalow. Brooks' initial reaction to the animation was This is shit. Afterwards the room almost cleared. A heated argument ensued between Brooks and Klasky Csupo animation studio head Gabor Csupo, who denied there was anything wrong with the animation and suggested that the real problem was the quality of the show's writing. The producers felt the animation did not exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time there were only a few choices for animation style. Usually, they would follow the style of either Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example of AKOM's early work that was considered by the producers to be too cartoonish was that the doors throughout in the episode were animated with the same rubber effect that they wanted to avoid. The style of Hanna Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either. The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode, Bart the Genius , turned out as this episode, but fortunately it turned out to suffer only a few easily fixed problems. Afterwards, the producers entreated Fox to postpone the series premiere for several months. The premiere then switched to Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire , which had to be aired in December being a Christmas special. This ensured more time could be spent fixing the animation problems and rewriting much of this episode. Directorial retakes were handled by David Silverman, who already had considerable experience directing the shorts. Silverman estimates that about 70 of everything had to be redone. Most of these retakes consisted of changing the backgrounds. The result is an episode where the animation is uneven, because it shifts between the early animation and the retakes. It is still possible to see the doors slam like they were made of rubber. The Fox censors wanted to replace the sentence the blue thing with the things , which they believed to be too sexual. Due to the fledgling position of the Fox network, Brooks had obtained an unusual contractual provision that ensured the network could not interfere with the creative process by providing show notes, so the producers simply ignored the censors. The episode featured a few early character designs. Moe Szyslak has black hair in this episode, which was later changed to grey. Barney Gumble has yellow hair, which was later changed to brown in order to differentiate the character's hair color from that of his skin. Because of the delayed broadcast, there are also a few continuity errors. Santa's Little Helper, for example, does not appear in this episode, despite being introduced in Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire . Hank Azaria was at the time credited as a guest star for portraying Moe Szyslak. In this episode, Moe was originally voiced by Christopher Collins, but when Azaria came up with his version they decided to dub over Collins' voice. Azaria became a regular cast member in the second season. Ms. Botz's pursuit of Bart into the cellar is reminiscent of Robert Mitchum's pursuit of a young boy in the film The Night of the Hunter. Moe's Tavern plays The Man That Got Away from the 1954 remake of A Star Is Born directed by George Cukor and starring Judy Garland and James Mason. In its original broadcast, Some Enchanted Evening finished 12th for the week in the Nielsen ratings with a rating of 15.4, being seen by approximately 14.2 million homes. The episode was the highest rated show on Fox that week. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said It's quite a shock to discover that this confident, fully rounded episode was the first to be made. The perfect template. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that he thought 'Evening' was a reasonably good episode and added that Still, it's an awkward piece, and not one I enjoyed a great deal. To be sure, 'Evening' was generally entertaining, but it's nothing special. In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck rated this episode a 1 12 of 5 . According to Al Jean, viewers thought this episode was the best episode of the first season after the season ended. However, in 2006, IGN.com named The Crepes of Wrath the best episode of the first season. Penny Marshall, who played Ms. Botz, ranked on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some%20Enchanted%20Evening%20%28The%20Simpsons%29
"Some Girls is a song by English singer Rachel Stevens from the 2004 reissue of her debut studio album, Funky Dory 2003 . It was written by Richard X and Hannah Robinson, and produced by the former, with additional production from Pete Hoffman. It was also included on Stevens' second studio album, Come and Get It 2005 . The song's music features a schaffel beat influenced by glam rock, and its lyrics describe a pop singer who performs sexual favours in her efforts to achieve stardom. The song was released on 12 July 2004 as a charity single for Sport Relief. The single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. Paul Weiland directed the accompanying music video, in which Stevens leads a parade of women out of the sewers and down the streets of London. American dance musician Henri released a cover version of Some Girls as a single in 2006. The song was recognised as the Best Pop Record of 2004 through the Popjustice 20 Music Prize. Some Girls was written by producer Richard X and songwriter Hannah Robinson. They spent several days working on the song, with girl group Girls Aloud in mind as potential performers. Warp Records and Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment contacted Richard X by email to ask that he give the song to Geri Halliwell or Stevens, respectively, to record. He agreed to have Stevens record the song after Richard Curtis asked about using the song for Sport Relief 2004. Richard X later stated that he was surprised Sport Relief chose such a sexually suggestive song. When Halliwell found out that the writers were having Stevens record the song, she locked herself in her car in an attempt to change their minds, and she later wrote Richard X a love song. The aftermath of the decision for Stevens to record the song became the subject of another song written by Richard X and Robinson, Me Plus One from Annie's 2004 album Anniemal. While recording with Stevens, Richard X decided to get spoken soundbites from her to make an extended version for the single's B side. To fit the song's glam sound, he asked her questions about the Winter of Discontent, to which Stevens reacted with bemusement and terror. The lyrics of Some Girls describe a pop singer's dreams of stardom. She performs fellatio on a man promising to make her a star. Stevens stated that she had not interpreted the lyrics to be about oral sex when she recorded the song. Richard X explained that he wanted to illustrate how the music industry treats people, so he and Robinson based some of the song's lines on anecdotes that they had heard. The song uses Richard X's icy synth pop sound. The synthesiser used was a Fairlight CMI Series IIx previously owned by pop group the Thompson Twins. It also features the German schaffel beat popularized by glam rock. Reviewers compared the song's glam influenced sound to T. Rex's 1971 single Hot Love and the work of Adam Ant. They also noted similarities between Some Girls and the more recent electronic glam music on Goldfrapp's 2003 album Black Cherry. PopMatters included it in its Best Music of 2004 selection, where Adrien Begrand commented that Stevens might have no singing voice to speak of, but did she ever score a slice of pop genius with her single 'Some Girls', on which the ever crafty Richard X brazenly hijacks a contagious German schaffel beat and tarts it up with a killer hook in the chorus that never, ever leaves your head . In his review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis referred to the song as remarkable for turning Stevens' detached vocal delivery into a strength. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times stated that Richard X's production allowed Stevens' vocals to into the icy beat . Pitchfork placed the song at number 24 on its Top 50 Singles of 2004 list and at number 258 on its The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s list, with Scott Plagenhoef praising its sharp production and Adam Ant esque 'whoa's . Some Girls was commercially successful in the United Kingdom, debuting at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The Shapeshifters' Lola's Theme kept the song from topping the chart noting the song's lyrics about an exasperated singer whose dreams of number one last forever , The Guardian remarked that the song's chart performance was as if following a script . BBC Radio 1 and 2 added Some Girls to their C playlists in late June 2004, and in early July, Radio 1 moved the song to its B playlist. The song quickly picked up airplay and was the most played song for the week of 24 July. Some Girls remained on the UK Singles Chart for 13 weeks. The song ended the year as the 40th best selling single in the UK. Largely due to the success of Some Girls , Funky Dory re entered the UK Albums Chart at number 13 in August 2004, selling 14,561 copies that week. The song was somewhat less successful in Ireland, where it debuted at number 15 on the Irish Singles Chart. It peaked at number 13 in its fifth week, spending a total of 12 weeks on the chart. The song's music video was written by Richard Curtis and directed by Paul Weiland. It was filmed at Borough Market in South London. Athletes Colin Jackson, Pat Cash, and Audley Harrison make appearances in the music video. The video opens with shots of a dank underground sewer. Stevens and a group of women walk through the sewer and put on sunglasses before climbing out of manholes and shafts. A large crowd of women, with Stevens leading them, parades down the streets as men observe the spectacle. The women begin spraying each other with bottles of water, before Stevens returns to the sewer. Throughout the video, sequences of Stevens and a group of backup dancers performing in the sewer are shown. The video received heavy play from MTV Hits and The Box. Richard X strongly disapproved of the music video. In an interview with NME, he stated, That video is crap , and he briefly commented on his official website that seeing it made want to give up life .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some%20Girls%20%28Rachel%20Stevens%20song%29
"Some Kind of Bliss is a song recorded by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, for her sixth studio album Impossible Princess 1997 . The song was released as the lead single from the album on 8 September 1997 through BMG, Deconstruction and Mushroom. Minogue co wrote the track with James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore while Bradfield and Dave Eringa produced it. Backed by guitar and drum instruments, Some Kind of Bliss is a Britpop track in which Minogue sings about feeling happy. Critical response to Some Kind of Bliss was mostly mixed earlier reviews were critical towards her image and sound transition to rock music, while retrospective reviews are positive towards her songwriting and sonic experimentation. Some Kind of Bliss performed relatively poorly on international charts peaking at number twenty seven on the Australian Singles Chart, at 22 on the UK Singles Chart her first solo release to miss the UK Top 20 and reaching number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. To promote Some Kind of Bliss , she performed the track on Top of the Pops, MTV Australia live and the Australian TV series Hey Hey It's Saturday. It was later included on her 1998 concert tour Intimate and Live Tour. David Mould directed the music video to the single, featuring Minogue and actor Dexter Fletcher robbing a gas station. The song was later included in the track list of Minogue's compilation albums including Confide in Me 2002 , Kylie Minogue Artist Collection 2004 , and Confide in Me The Irresistible Kylie 2007 . After releasing the single Where the Wild Roses Grow with Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on 2 October 1995, Minogue received acclaim from critics for her experimentation with rock music, who praised her transition from being the once dubbed singing budgie to a mature woman. Because of this, Minogue, with the support of her then boyfriend Stephane Sednaoui, decided to experiment with her music for the upcoming album. Welsh musician James Dean Bradfield contacted Minogue's A R Pete Hadfield, asking him what their current project was where Hadfield replied Kylie Minogue's new album . He asked Hadfield if he could work with Minogue and was approved. After Bradfield sent her a demo of the album track I Don't Need Anyone , Minogue was dissatisfied with the lyrical content and re wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it difficult to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of I Don't Need Anyone . She found this method of writing intriguing and wanted to do it again, so she decided to do this with Some Kind of Bliss , writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying He took one half of one set and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things. She later commented that she felt it worked together. While in production for the album, creative production was handled by Minogue and producers Brothers in Rhythm. Deconstruction Records' A R Pete Hadfield was concerned with the lack of single choices, where he felt the songs written by Minogue were not up to commercial standards. Because of this, a potential January 1997 single release was postponed to make the album perfect . Some Kind of Bliss was released as the lead single from Impossible Princess on 8 September 1997. There are two songs on the CD editions off Some Kind of Bliss Limbo , a track was rejected as a single, and a new song Love Takes Over Me . Some Kind of Bliss was written by Minogue herself alongside Welsh performers James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore, while the production was handled by Bradfield and Dave Eringa. It was recorded at Mayfair Studios, London, England in 1997, and was mixed by Alan Bremnar at Roundhouse Studios. It is a Britpop song with alternative rock and rock tinged elements that lasts a duration of four minutes and thirteen seconds on the album. Instrumentally, Some Kind of Bliss features bass, electric and acoustic guitars, drums, string sections, flute, and a saxophone. Lyrically, the song is about Minogue's experiences while away from people and being happy, saying To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone ... the ability to feel like they're with you even if they are a million miles away. A reviewer from Sputnikmusic said 'Some Kind of Bliss' is one of the more pop rock songs that could have been part of her earlier work. This gem breaks up the dominance of the sleepy trance vibe to a more upbeat feel. Michael R. Smith from The Daily Vault felt that it was surprisingly a strong and straightforward rock song. Nick Levine from Digital Spy labelled the music as Motowny Indie , while Sarah Smith from FasterLouder called it pure pop . Priya from NME said Some Kind of Bliss is a brassy 60's influenced number which has a totally Everything Must Go vibe to it. Martin Power, who wrote the biography Nailed to History The Story of the Manic Street Preachers 2012 for the Manic Street Preachers, commented that Some Kind of Bliss was far away from Minogue's glory days of 'I Should Be So Lucky' and 'Better the Devil You Know' as it was possible to get. A reviewer from The Australian noticed the transition from Minogue's earlier work by saying The new single is not as heavily produced as her past songs, leaving her voice sounding edgier, and guitars take the place of the drum machine beats of earlier efforts. Initial reviews toward Some Kind of Bliss were mixed. Writing for NME in November 1997, Ben Willmott called it supremely irritating and stated Kylie belts out the lyrics like she's reading from an autocue. Any soul is lost in a slurry of bought in brass and a ropey guitar solo that's be more at home on a Shakin' Stevens record. John Magnan from The Age said while the song was a stand out to the album, it is actually one of the album's clunkier tracks . A reviewer from Music Week awarded the song four stars out of five, stating Kylie changes musical tack again with this dense, big sounding single, co written with two of the Manics, which loudly announces she's back in style. Gareth Gorman said that while the song showcased Minogue's thin vocals , he followed saying it still works due to one of those melody lines that is inevitable stunning, simple and effective. Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine stated Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time that Stock, Aitken and Waterman ever dreamed of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully cultivated bow. Larry Flick from Billboard was positive, saying Ms. Minogue has been reborn as an alterna pop vixen to be reckoned with. The song received more positive reviews in retrospect. Allmusic's Chris True had selected the song as an album stand out and a career stand out track. While reviewing her 2002 compilation Confide in Me, True stated Impossible Princess, both of which found her stretching and growing beyond the pop princess image she had previously. Dark, noisy tracks like Limbo, the trip hoppy Jump, and the more rock oriented I Don't Need Anyone and Some Kind of Bliss both of which were co written by the Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfieldfound her trying on different styles to replace the bubblegum pop of the past. A reviewer from Who Magazine called the song Funky , Spunky, Rocky, Big. Jaime Gill from Yahoo Music reviewed her Ultimate Kylie compilation album, and criticised the musical composition by calling it an awkward faux rock . Matt James from PopMatters reviewed her compilation The Best of Kylie Minogue and was disappointed with Some Kind of Bliss ' absence, labelling it a lost classic . In 2017, Billboard ranked it as the 76th greatest pop song of 1997 Andrew Unterberger wrote that the song's string soaked guitar pop remains surprisingly alluring, a fascinating glimpse at an alternate reality in which the disco diva is better remembered for ripped jeans than golden hot pants, and sounds no less like herself for it . Writing for the Herald Sun, Cameron Adams placed it at number 21 on his list of the singer's best songs in honor of her 50th birthday, calling it the peak of 'Indie Kylie' ... a modern retro 60s girl band garage pop heaven, filled with brass, sass and class . The song entered at twenty seven on the Australian Singles Chart and fell to thirty nine the following week. Some Kind of Bliss stayed in the chart for six weeks, and resulted as her lowest charting lead single from an album until her single Into the Blue from Kiss Me Once 2014 peaked at forty six. The song entered and peaked at number forty six on the New Zealand Singles Chart for a sole week, her lowest charting single after her 1988 single It's No Secret . In the United Kingdom, Some Kind of Bliss entered at number twenty two on 20 September 1997, which broke Minogue's consecutive top twenty hits and became her lowest solo single until Better than Today from Aphrodite 2010 at thirty two on 20 November 2010. The music video was directed by David Mould and was shot in the Desert of Tabernas in Spain. The music video features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue's lover. The video is set in non linear structure, as it opens with Minogue and Fletcher in a blue cadillac at a gas station, with Minogue staring inside the gas station while Fletcher sits in the car after being released from jail. Several scenes feature Minogue and Fletcher in different outfits in different areas, driving and running around a hotel. There are scenes with Minogue and Fletcher fighting, being happy and playing around in there hotel room. During the bridge sequence, Minogue and Fletcher park in front of a shop, and Minogue seductively tries to distract the cashier outside by staring and posing at him, while Fletcher tries to steal money from the till. In the last scenes, Minogue is in another outfit trying to walk out of an alley with a bag of money, but sees a police car driving towards her and tries to walk off. Fletcher is caught by police and is escorted into the police car while yelling at Minogue. Minogue, who see the alteration, drives off with the money and looks back at Fletcher while driving down the street. Robbie Daw from Idolator listed the video at eight on their Kylie Minogue's Sexiest Videos. Daw said There's something so casually sexy about this Bonnie and Clyde themed video. Kylie spends a lot of time wearing skimpy denim dresses while dealing with the fallout from her criminal love interest. The public had voted in which Minogue's video was the sexiest. Conversely, Some Kind of Bliss was put in last place with 1 of the votes 15 votes . The music video was featured on the first CD single of her November 1997 single Did It Again , and was included on her video compilations The Kylie Tapes 9498 1998 , Greatest Hits 8799 2003 and Artist Collection 2004 . To promote the single, Minogue performed the song on several televised shows. Her debut live performance of the single was on the Australian variety program Hey Hey It's Saturday. She went on to perform the single on MTV on 4 October 1997 and in the UK on both TFI Friday and Top of the Pops. Some Kind of Bliss was included on the set list for her 1998 concert tour Intimate and Live. The song was featured on the opening act for the tour and featured Minogue singing the track on stage, wearing a black long collared shirt and three quarter pants, similar to the costume off Did It Again . Like the rest of the costumes on the tour including the performance off Some Kind of Bliss , it features Minogue with a lot of princess inspired outfits. Some Kind of Bliss has been recognized by critics as Minogue's most indie influenced song to date and one of her least successful singles to date. Author Lee Barron, who wrote the book Social Theory in Popular Culture, discussed the Impossible Princess period and further stated that Some Kind of Bliss was one of the main aspects for her Indie Kylie label in the media. Craig Mathieson, who wrote the book Playlisted Everything You Need to Know about Australian Music Right Now 2009 , stated about the song It was a statement of intent, but not as planned. A sense of freedom, a belief in the lure of happiness, did not suit Kylie. She's best defined by constriction ad reduction, an her music has subsequently become a soundtrack to lack of choice. The poor reception prompt Hadfield to release an apology to Minogue, blaming himself for not being in control of the promotion I loved her voice, got on with her and I am embarrassed that I failed her. Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003 release of Impossible Princess, had observed that critics slated Some Kind of Bliss due to Minogue's approach to obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole . Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start. She went on to say I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out ... The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands. She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms she later commented that she departed on good terms . Some Kind of Bliss has been featured on many of Minogue's compilation albums. Its first appearance was on her 2000 Deconstruction greatest hits Hits and on her 2001 BMG greatest hits compilation album Confide in Me, a compilation consisting majority off her singles and tracks from her Deconstruction period Heather Phares from Allmusic praised the Impossible Princess tracks including Some Kind of Bliss . It then appeared on her 2004 compilation albums Artist Collection and, which included most of her Impossible Princess era. The appeared on the first disc of Confide in Me The Irresistible Kylie released in July 2007 by UK independent label Music Club and her K25 Time Capsule by Warner Music Australia in October 2012. The Quivver remix appeared on her 1998 remix compilations Mixes and Impossible Remixes. These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of Some Kind of Bliss .

Somebody That I Used to Know has been performed several times on major US TV shows such as The Voice, American Idol, and Saturday Night Live. It was covered by Canadian indie rock group Walk off the Earth using a single guitar played simultaneously by all five band members and by actors Darren Criss and Matt Bomer in the Glee episode Big Brother . The hit song's accompanying music video was directed by Australian artist Natasha Pincus. The video, which has received over 1.2 billion views on YouTube as of March 2019, premiered on 5 July 2011. It shows Gotye and Kimbra naked against a white backdrop. While they sing, a pattern of paint gradually covers their skin and the backdrop via stop motion animation. Gotye discussed writing Somebody That I Used to Know in an interview with Sound on Sound Writing 'Somebody' was a gradual and linear process. I started with the Luiz Bonfa sample, then I found the drums, and after that I started working on the lyric and the melody, and added the wobbly guitar sample melody. After that, I took a break, and a few weeks later I came back to the session and decided on the chorus chord progression, wrote the chorus melody, and combined that with sounds like the Latin loop and some of the percussion and the flute sounds that further filled the space. At that point I hit a brick wall. I was thinking 'This is pretty good, how can I get to the end really quickly ' and I was trying to take lazy decisions to finish the song. I considered repeating the chorus, an instrumental bridge, a change in tempo or key, I even considered finishing the song after the first chorus. But nothing felt like it was strong enough. So the third session was all about writing the female part and changing the perspective. The arrangement of 'Somebody' is reflective of me moving towards using sounds that provide me with inspiration for a texture or a platform for an idea, and then through sonic manipulation and coming up with original melodies and harmonic ideas to make it my own. I guess the balance of sounds taken from records and samples I created myself is perhaps 5050. Somebody That I Used to Know is an art pop song and has a length of four minutes and five seconds. Gotye uses a sample of Brazilian jazz guitarist Luiz Bonfa's 1967 instrumental song Seville , with additional instrumentations of beats and a xylophone. It was written and produced by Gotye himself, while in his parents' barn on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria. Gotye commented that he wrote the song in quite a linear way , explaining that I wrote the first verse, the second verse, and I'd got to the end of the first chorus and for the first time ever I thought, 'There's no interesting way to add to this guy's story'. It felt weak. The track was recorded between January and May 2011 with Gotye struggling to find a suitable female vocalist, as a 'high profile' female vocalist cancelled the collaboration at the last minute, and Kimbra lucked out as the replacement . He tested his girlfriend, Tash Parker, but somehow their happiness meant that it didn't work out so he followed the recommendation of the song's mixer and used Kimbra's vocals. Martin Davies from Click Music considered the song instantly captivating , and named Kimbra's voice clean and sugar soaked , further commenting that it bears an uncanny resemblance to singer Katy Perry. Gotye stated that the song was definitely drawn from various experiences I've had in relationships breaking up, and in the parts of the more reflective parts of the song, in the aftermath and the memory of those different relationships and what they were and how they broke up and what's going on in everyone's minds. Yeah, so it's an amalgam of different feelings but not completely made up as such . In an interview with Rolling Stone Australia , he described the song as a curated reflection of multiple past relationships . The song received generally positive reviews, winning the Grammy for Record of the Year. Take 40 Australia elaborated on the audience's reception at the July 2011 Splendour in the Grass festival, Gotye's latest song featuring Kimbra 'Somebody That I Used To Know' had become somewhat of an unofficial anthem for the festival ... every car was cranking it over their speakers all day, every day ... and the question on everyone's lips was whether or not Kimbra would join him on the track. Fortunately, dreams came true ... he smashed out an incredible set climaxing with a version of the song with Kimbra on co lead vocals that people couldn't stop talking about all weekend long . Allmusic's Jon O'Brien felt the track was an unexpected chart topper ... is an oddball break up song whose stuttering rhythms, reggae hooks, and hushed vocals sound like The Police as remixed by The xx . Writing for Digital Spy, Lewis Corner rated the song four stars out of five and described it as a Bon Iver styled ballad for the music buying masses . Martin Davies from Click Music gave the song five stars out of five and stated that the song is that rare example of a track that hits you squarely between the eyes . In November 2011, music blog This Must Be Pop predicted the song as a post Christmas UK hit. John Watson, who co manages Gotye with Danny Rogers, said of the single's success We've never seen any song make a deeper or more immediate connection with so many people. It's a really special recording and video . Talking about the overwhelming reception and the amount of coverage received, Gotye commented that I don't really feel like it belongs to me anymore. He further explained that sometimes I feel like I'm a bit sick of it. My inbox, on any given day, has at least five covers or parodies or remixes of it and there's only so many times you can listen to the one song.

Gotye himself is an engaging character for sure... his solemnly expressive eyes finish a journey his lyrics only begin. 'Told myself that you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company' simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice.

Canning also said that this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock.

Canning rated this episode 9.5 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that it's not surprising that in my opinion, at least it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's almost as if the funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by Wiig in the Lifetime movie. He thought that the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well. Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Overall, another splendid . My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, and it seemed to me like the show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too. Beth McCarthy, the director of this episode, was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing Comedy Series.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody%20to%20Love%20%2830%20Rock%29

Rather than a storyline as in Bieber's previous videos, the video focuses on a dance and choreography aspect. Meyers stated that he wanted the video to be more playful, stating, We're bringing Justin into the world of dance on this one, giving Justin the chance to integrate to different styles of dance. So we kind of kept it simple with the art direction, just real graphic and really highlighting the dance. No big story lines, no crowds of people, just real clean.

Jocelyn Vena of MTV News commented, While Bieber had previously teased his dancing skills in the Baby video, he really channeled Usher's smooth moves in this newest clip. Tamar Antai also of MTV said, Usher does most of the heavy lifting where dancing is concerned, and Justin Bieber, who's more of a singer than a dancer, is in no danger of upstaging Usher on the dance floor. Antai compared Bieber's moves to Usher in his Caught Up video, commenting it's nice to see Justin expanding the scope of talents to include pelvic thrusts, Matrix style slo mo leans and, it's also nice to see Justin looking a little more mature and sophisticated in a hoodie and leather jacket....and his videos are growing up with him, as this is his flashiest, most grandiose video yet. Antai also commented on the appeal of the video, commending Meyers, who put that classic early '00s style big money polish on the piece for employing fire, shirtless dudes, white ninjas... Bieber performed Somebody to Love on multiple occasions, including as a part of his set list on the My World Tour. On most televised performances the song was performed alongside Baby and more of his previous songs. He performed the song at a number of venues, in Wales at Radio 1's Big Weekend on May 22, 2010.

For the performance, Bieber, donning a black and red letter jacket and a '50's style cardigan, drove into the Nokia Theater in a 1957 red Chevrolet car, and was chased by girls paying homage to The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night. He then proceeded to perform U Smile as an introduction, followed by Baby and Somebody to Love , which had dance parts in which his background dancers wore the same attire as him. During the Somebody to Love performance Bieber and backup dancers performed an elaborate dance routine including younger children, which was followed by a drum solo by the singer. During the performance of the song, black and red confetti fell from the sky. Critics appreciated the performance, with a Jocelyn Vena of MTV News calling Bieber a triple threat. Baby and Somebody to Love were performed by Bieber on the seventh series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom on November 28, 2010.

The initial stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney and Kevin Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.

Someday I Will Understand initially received mixed reviews from music critics. While reviewing Britney Kevin Chaotic, Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody noted, Britney now sings about either the husband or the kid. Gil Kaufman of MTV thought the song a horrible Britney ballad with the black and white video that began her descent into madness. Leo Ebersole of the Chicago Tribune considered it a fictional piece , while another reviewer from the same newspaper noted that as a matter of fact, the song is more or less a lesson in Britney history. Becky Bain of Idolator praised the track, stating that Britney goes genuine for this ode to her unborn baby. Kurt Kirton of About.com said that And Then We Kiss and other remixes of songs like Toxic and Someday I Will Understand on the remix album B in the Mix The Remixes hold their own . IGN writer Spence D. noted the Hi Bias Signature Radio Remix reverberates with all the cliches that often stifle the music that rustles through the late night early morning club scenes around the world. Rolling Stone contributor Barry Walters gave the song's remix a negative review, saying that nothing can rescue Spears' freakishly sappy flop single Someday I Will Understand . Bradley Stern also of MTV, however, praised the Leama Moor Remix, saying it transforms the tearjerker of a ballad into a full on trance anthem. Big beats, stuttering vocals it's heartbreak on the dance floor. Over the years following its release, attitude toward the song began to change for the positive. Ten years after its release, a reviewer for AXS called the song serene and the most sincere single of her career. A writer for MuuMuse said that while the song was not career defining, it was interesting, and certainly personal.

It was shot entirely in black and white. Spears asserted that her life had come full circle and implied that in the process she underwent changes in her soul and body, as shown in the video. It premiered on June 14, 2005 during the fifth and last episode of Spears's reality show Britney Kevin Chaotic, titled Veil of Secrecy . The music video features a pregnant Spears lying in bed and walking around a house while singing to her unborn child. She also gazes through the window at the Roman sculptures in the garden. Hayley Butler of Jam said the video is a far cry from the snake handling, sweating and skimpy Britney videos of the past. Dressed in a classy silk dress, she runs through gardens, lies in bed and walks through the grass, all with a burgeoning belly. John Mitchel of MTV included the video on the list Beyonce, Britney And Madonna What To Expect When You're Expecting Music Video Edition in 2011. Despite praising the track, Idolator blogger Becky Bain stated that at this point she still looks like a teenager herself, so it's a little disconcerting seeing her with that huge belly, singing about motherhood.

"Someday is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her self titled debut studio album 1990 . It is a dance pop song with new jack swing influences. Prior to Carey signing a record contract, she and producer Ben Margulies had written and produced a four track demo which included Someday . After signing a contract with Columbia Records, Carey began work on her debut album and she reached out to Ric Wake to ask if he would produce the song, to which he agreed. The composition of the demo recording was changed during the recording process, most notably replacing the horns with a guitar, which Carey disapproved of. Someday was released as the album's third single on November 15, 1990, in the United Kingdom and was released the following month in the United States with multiple remixes. The song was a critical and commercial success, being described as an album highlight and becoming Carey's third consecutive number one single on the US Billboard Hot 100. Someday was subsequently included on many of Carey's compilation albums and greatest hits releases, including 1's 1998 , Greatest Hits 2001 , The Essential Mariah Carey 2011 and 1 to Infinity 2015 . In 1988, an 18 year old Mariah Carey moved out from her mother's house in Long Island and into an apartment in Manhattan. She had composed a four track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat checker, in order to pay for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice glimpses of Carey's gifted vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed some guidance to break into the industry. One evening, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, was interested in Carey as she handed him the tape, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola grabbed it from him, and said that he would tend to the project . Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super stardom. After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988. Prior to Carey signing her record deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and produced fourteen songs over a three year period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self titled debut studio album 1990 , including Someday . Someday was one of the four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that Someday was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it if you want to do it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me. Someday was recorded and mixed by Bob Cadway at The Power Station in New York City. In addition to be written by Carey and Margulies, they also arranged the song with Chris Toland. In addition to producing the track, Wake also carried out additional arrangement with Rich Tancredi. The drum programming was performed by Wake and Joe Franco, while Cadway played the guitars and Tancredi the keyboards. Carey performed all of her own background vocals. Carey later revealed that Someday was one of her favorite songs on the demo and that she would listen to it over and over again on the subway after the studio sessions . However, Carey later expressed her disapproval of some of the new elements added during the production of Mariah Carey, such as the replacement of the horns on the demo in favor of an electric guitar. Someday was released as the third single Mariah Carey as a CD single in the United Kingdom on November 15, 1990, and as a maxi single in the United States on December 13, 1990. Included on the maxi single are the 'New 7 Jackswing,' the 'New 7 Straight,' the 'New 12 Jackswing' and the 'Pianopercapella New' mix, all of which were produced by Shep Pettibone, while Alone in Love was included as the B side. Alone in Love was also written by Carey and Margulies, and produced by Rhett Lawrence. Someday has been included on many of Carey's compilation albums and greatest hits releases, including 1's 1998 , Greatest Hits 2001 , The Essential Mariah Carey 2011 , and 1 to Infinity 2015 . Despite having released two highly successful albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions 1991 , the singer had yet to embark on world tour because of stage fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of Someday , she altered the arrangement and stripped it back to give it a rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of 1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that she wished she could delete some of the overproduction, which is why she decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. The arrangement of MTV Unplugged rendition was also included on the set list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, 1 to Infinity 201517 . The fourth song on the track list of Mariah Carey, Someday is the album's first up tempo track. It is a dance pop song with new jack swing influences, which lasts for a duration of four minutes, six seconds. Lyrically, it is about how Carey is gleefully waiting for bad karma to come to her ex boyfriend who dumped her, which can be heard in the lyrics Cause I know you'll soon discover you're needing me in spite of all the others. AllMusic writer Ashley S. Battel said it is energetic . To mark twenty five years since the release of Mariah Carey in June 1990, Billboard writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track by track review of the album in June 2015. He noted that, being the fourth track on the track listing, it is the album's first up tempo song and that is beats new life into it as a result. However, he felt that some of the rhythmic arrangements and the electric guitar solo during the bridge prevented Someday from sounding timeless. In the United States, Someday became Carey's third consecutive number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 following Vision of Love and Love Takes Time . Someday became her first song to top the Dance Club Songs chart on March 16, 1991, and her second chart topper on the Radio Songs chart. The track peaked at number three on the Hot R B Hip Hop Songs chart and number five on the Adult Contemporary chart. After three months of release, the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA certified the song gold, denoting shipments of more than 500,000 copies. In 2015, Billboard writer Gary Trust compiled a list of Carey's twenty five best performing songs based on their weekly performance Someday ranks as the singer's eighth best performing track of her career on the Hot 100. Trust also noted that Carey proved her way by releasing a club song which reached number one following two chart topping ballads. In Canada, Someday reached at number five on the main chart, but peaked at number one on both the Top Singles and Adult Contemporary charts. It also reached a peak of number four on the Dance chart. Outside of North America, Someday reached the top fifteen in New Zealand, the top forty in France and the United Kingdom, and the top fifty in Australian and Belgium. The accompanying music video begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering a high school corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about in the classroom and corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.9 million views on YouTube as of June 2017. The extended version of the video was included on The First Vision 1991 VHS and its subsequent DVD reissue, in which Carey stated that she loved watching the kids dancing and getting to interact with them and that she had fun during the video shoot. The video was removed from the tracklisting of the 1's video release, as Carey felt ashamed of the results of the video, instead being replaced by the MTV Unplugged performance. In 2015, to coincide with the release of 1 to Infinity Carey released videos of herself talking about the videos to songs on the compilation. For Someday, Carey stated that she dislikes the video, mainly because of the tomfoolery scenes of the kids. She said that she would've kept only the closeups and that the girl playing the younger version of herself was cute.

"'Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me is the twenty first episode of the second season of the American crime thriller television series Millennium. It premiered on the Fox network on May 1, 1998. The episode was written and directed by Darin Morgan, and featured guest appearances by Bill Macy, Dick Bakalyan and Alex Diakun. In this episode, a group of demons convene in a doughnut shop to share stories of tempting and damning humans. However, their stories all seem to include one mysterious figure who can see them for who they really areFrank Black Lance Henriksen . Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me marks Morgan's second and last script for the series, and parodies his earlier difficulties writing for The X Files. The episode has received mixed to positive reviews, and earned Morgan a Bram Stoker Award for Best Screenplay nomination in 1999. Four elderly men meet for coffee late at night. The fourth to arrive is hostile to the waiter, who secretly urinates in the man's coffee. The man, Abum Dick Bakalyan , realizes this, and the group share a laugh over it, during which they are revealed to actually be demons. One of them, Blurk Bill Macy , complains that there are no strong personalities in this century. He tells a story of Perry, a man he met hitch hiking, who he molded into a serial killer over encouraging conversations. Perry sought to emulate Johnny Mack Potter, the country's most prolific killer, and to break his record number of murders. As Perry drew level with Potter's figure, Blurk grew bored accompanying him on the mundane murders of prostitutes and vagrants. Blurk gave an anonymous tip to the police that leads to Perry's arrest one of the men present at the arrestoffender profiler Frank Black Lance Henriksen seems to see through Blurk's human disguise. In prison, Perry is murdered by his cellmate Johnny Mack Potter, reclaiming his record. Abum tells another story, which he believes shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited a strip club often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature. Greb Alex Diakun shares his tale, of a television censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed the form of a small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spreeFiggleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this. The fourth devil, Toby Wally Dalton , is convinced that Black really does know that they are demons. Toby also recounts his story, in which he begins to feel ennui at his failure to damn humans for some time. He meets and courts an aging stripper, Sally, who falls in love with him. Their relationship blossomed, despite her having seen his true demonic form. One day Toby leads her to believe he is about to propose to her, before instead curtly insulting and breaking up with her. He later visited her home to find police investigating her suicidea successful damnation. However, he also encounters Black, who sees his true nature. Instead of recoiling or reacting, Black simply tells Toby that he sees how lonely he must be. Toby's story affects all the gathered demons, who realize how lonely they really are. As they get up to leave, Abum praises the shop's coffee and briefly reveals his true form to the waiter. Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me is the second, and last, episode of Millennium to have been written by Darin Morgan, who also directed the episode. Morgan had previously written and directed Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense earlier in the season. Morgan also served as a consulting producer for the season, and is the younger brother of Glen Morgan, an executive producer for the series. Morgan's script contains several references to his time as a writer for Millennium's sister show, The X Files. One of Morgan's episodes for that series, War of the Coprophages , had come under heavy criticism by the standards and practices department at parent network Fox, who took exception to the initial script's heavy use of words such as crap to refer to the excrement that episode's cockroaches fed upon. Morgan attacked and parodied this approach with one of the tales in Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me , with a network censor again targeting the use of the word crap and storming onto the set of a show resembling The X Files being taped, featuring lookalikes of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully with theme music very similar to that series' playing in the background. The episode also contains a version of the dancing baby animation that was popular at the time, parodying its use on the series Ally McBeal. Guest star Alex Diakun had previously appeared in the first season episode Lamentation in an unrelated role while Dan Zukovic, who played network censor Waylon Figgleif, had also appeared in a small role in Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense . Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 1, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.7 during its original broadcast, meaning that 5.7 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately 5.59 million households, and left the episode the eightieth most viewed broadcast that week. Morgan's script for the episode earned him a Bram Stoker Award nomination in 1999, for Best Screenplay the award was won jointly by Bill Condon for Gods and Monsters and Alex Proyas, David S. Goyer and Lem Dobbs for Dark City. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, calling it maybe the best hour of television Millennium ever produced . Handlen felt that the episode's disarmingly simple premise belied its depth, and praised Morgan's script as perhaps the writer's best work. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, calling it a very fun, very irreverent respite for the series . Gibron felt positively about the episode's dialogue and humor, and praised it for its self parodying elements. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe A Critical Guide to The X Files, Millennium The Lone Gunmen, rated Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me two stars out of five, finding that it fit poorly with the tone of the series. Shearman felt that the episode was self indulgent and irrelevant at worst, and at best only sporadically funny .",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somehow%2C%20Satan%20Got%20Behind%20Me
"Someone Else is a song by American recording artist Miley Cyrus for her fourth studio album Bangerz 2013 . Cyrus collaborated with Mike Will Made It, MoZella, P Nasty, and Rock City during the songwriting process, while production was handled by Mike Will Made It and P Nasty. Someone Else is influenced by electronic dance music EDM , and additionally incorporates elements of synthpop its lyrics reference Cyrus' evolving public image during production of the parent record. Contemporary music critics were divided in their opinions of Someone Else , feeling that its generic production overshadowed its lyrical meaning and Cyrus' vocal performance. Despite not having been released as a single, it peaked at number 93 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Cyrus has also performed the track during her ongoing Bangerz Tour, where she was notably suspended mid air on a large hot dog. During an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2013, host Ellen DeGeneres asked Cyrus if Bangerz was inspired by her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, to which she replied the whole album is a story of that and I think it says that starting with 'Adore You' and ending with 'Someone Else' ..... I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually thought I did at the time. Elysa Gardner of USA Today thought of Someone Else as a more reflective lyrical offering from its parent record, while Lipshutz interpreted the track to detail the departure of Cyrus' past baggage and the introduction of her new self . Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer assumed that the song was designed to address her transition from her innocent Hannah Montana image and then recent breakup with fiance Liam Hemsworth from a production standpoint, he jokingly referenced Cyrus' earlier single We Can't Stop when mentioning that her party and she can do what she wants , in regards to the increasingly diverse genres she had begun experimenting with. Los Angeles Times' Mikael Wood opined that it spoke of the psychic damage that comes with prosperity in the entertainment industry. Based on the line if you're looking for love know that love don't live here anymore from the refrain, David Drake and David Bry from Complex opined that Cyrus' track was thematically similar to Love Don't Live Here Anymore by Rose Royce. Someone Else was written by Cyrus, Mike Will Made It, MoZella, P Nasty, and Rock City it was produced by Mike Will Made It, with co production by P Nasty, and engineered by Chris Tek O'Ryan. Stephen Hybicki recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua assistance from Ryan Kaul. Heather Phares from AllMusic noticed the frequent incorporation of early 2010s trends throughout Bangerz, and highlighted the electronic dance music EDM heard on Someone Else as an illustration of said production values. Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly also identified the song as an EDM track, while Billboard columnist Jason Lipshutz recognized further experimentation with synthpop musical styles. The track is one of five songs where Cyrus raps on Bangerz. Someone Else received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. On behalf of AllMusic, Heather Phares opined that Cyrus sounds more mature than ever before and successfully paired her vocals with current musical trends. Katie Hasty from HitFix expressed a similar opinion, and suggested that Cyrus' vocal delivery was big and convincing . When discussing Cyrus' recently introduced rapping, Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly felt that the track saw Cyrus up her chops and into relief in an unoriginal fashion just how meek typical DJ bros like their hook girls. The Los Angeles Times' Mikael Wood suggested that Someone Else was not as effective or as arresting a statement as Cyrus' cover version of Look What They've Done To My Song by Melanie Safka he implied that Someone Else suffered from its hollowed out beat and production values. Sharing a similar sentiment, Evan Sawdey from PopMatters was disappointed by its vanilla Euro club sound, which he felt proved that Mike Will Made It offered more misses than hits for the record. On behalf of Digital Spy, Catriona Wightman suggested that Cyrus was writing lyrics based on real life experience in a fashion similar to Taylor Swift she assumed that the lyrics cried and lied acknowledged the reportedly turbulent relationship she experienced with Hemsworth. Wightman also felt that the line I thought you'd catch me if I fall and fill me up when I'm empty signified a lack of support from Hemsworth. Writing for Thought Catalog, Cody Delistraty summarized the track as a presentation of implicit versus explicit redundancy he highlighted the lines 'Cause that's what I've seen in movies, come to find out its not like that at all and you see real life's much different for their perceived unnecessary repetition that failed to add meaningful philosophies to the recording. Cyrus has performed Someone Else during her headlining Bangerz Tour it was among the final songs performed during the first showing in Vancouver on February 14, 2014. The track followed her performances of 23 by Mike Will Made It, in which she is featured artist, and her track On My Own . Dressed in an oversized fluffy yellow coat, Cyrus sang the track while sitting mid air on a hot dog. Writing for Idolator, Mike Williott felt that the extravagant theatrics made a very memorable segment out of a usually forgettable song. Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly praised the segment as the highlight of the concert, and further commented that Cyrus' delivery made the track a token EDM performance. Credits adapted from the liner notes of Bangerz. Someone Else debuted at number 93 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The track also charted at numbers 97 and 172 on the Canadian Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someone%20Else%20%28song%29
"Somerhill House smrhl has is a Grade I listed Jacobean mansion situated near Tonbridge, Kent, United Kingdom. It was built for The 4th Earl of Clanricarde in 161113. The estate was sequestrated by Parliament in 1645, and restored to its rightful owner in 1660. The building had become derelict by the mid eighteenth century but was later restored. Somerhill was painted by Turner in 1811. It was bought by a member of the Goldsmid family in 1849 and greatly extended between 1879 and 1897, making it the second largest house in Kent, after Knole House, Sevenoaks. Somerhill housed a Prisoner of War camp, Prisoner of War Camp No. 40, during the Second World War, following which it became the home of the d'Avigdor Goldsmids and was visited by many celebrities of the time. Somerhill was sold by the d'Avigdor Goldsmids in 1980, and again went into decline, being damaged by vandalism and storms. In 1993, The Schools at Somerhill moved in, as of October 2019 the building is used as a school. Somerhill House lies 1 12 miles 2.4 km south of Tonbridge at grid reference TQ 6086 4510, in the civil parish of Tudeley cum Capel, which falls under Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. Somerhill is built of sandstone. The stone also contains iron, which gives it a red colour. This stone is known as Calverley Stone. The house is in the shape of a letter H , with the main hall forming the bar of the H . The main elevation of the house faces west. The building is three storeys high, with a half basement. It has five gables on the main elevation. The roof is of an A frame construction, clad in Kentish peg tiles. The south wing houses the library, the second longest room in Kent at 93 feet 28 m long, exceeded only by the Gallery at Knole House, Sevenoaks. The main staircase is in the south wing. The north wing housed service rooms and the kitchen, with a parlour at the rear. As built, the house measured almost 100 feet 30 m in depth internally. The hall measures 23 feet 7.0 m by 47 feet 14.3 m . To its north was a 22 feet 6.7 m by 25 feet 7.6 m drawing room. The dining room, located to the right of the hall measured 22 feet 6.7 m by 33 feet 10 m . As extended, Somerhill provides around 49,000 square feet 4,600 m2 of floorspace. The house shows the transition from medieval architecture, in which the hall was the main living and entertaining room, to the more modern plan, where the hall became a reception room. Somerhill is one of the earliest examples of this. When built, this was an innovative design. The land that Somerhill was built on originally formed part of the estate of South Frith, one of two deer parks in the Lowey of Tonbridge. At one time the estate covered 6,500 acres 2,600 ha . Built on the site of an earlier mansion, and designed by John Thorpe, the house was built between 1611 and 1613, dates which are to be found on the surviving leaden rainwater heads. Somerhill was built for The 4th Earl of Clanricarde, an Anglo Irish nobleman. The design was based on that of the Villa Valmarana, Lisiera, Italy, which was designed by Palladio. Lord Clanricarde died in 1636, and Somerhill passed to his son Ulick, 5th Earl of Clanricarde, who was created The 1st Marquess of Clanricarde in 1646. Following the Battle of Naseby in 1645, Somerhill was sequestrated by Parliament, which gave it to The 3rd Earl of Essex, the half brother of Ulick, Lord Clanricarde. On his death in September 1646, Parliament gave Somerhill to John Bradshaw. John Evelyn, who visited Somerhill on 29 May 1652, described Somerhill as situated on an eminent hill, with a park, but has nothing else extraordinary . Following the Restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, Somerhill was given to Margaret, Viscountess Muskerry, the daughter of The 1st Marquess of Clanricarde. Lady Muskerry had extravagant tastes, and gradually sold off much of the lands of South Frith to various people. She died in 1698, and Somerhill passed to her son, John Villiers, who styled himself the Earl of Buckingham. Villers sold the Manor of South Frith to one Dekins. Some 1,200 acres 490 ha of grounds was sold separately to Abraham Hill of Sutton at Hone, Kent. Somerhill itself had been let to a warrener. Dekins sold Somerhill to one Cave, who sold it in 1712 to John Woodgate of Penshurst. Woodgate lived in the house, and on his death it passed to his son Henry, who lived at Somerhill until 1769, and then within the town of Tonbridge until his death in 1787. On 5 August 1752, the house was visited by Horace Walpole, who described its setting as commanding a vast landscape, beautifully wooded and has quantities of large old trees to shelter itself . By 1766, Somerhill was in a ruinous state. It was to remain derelict throughout the century. In 1787, Somerhill passed to William Woodgate, who was Henry Woodgate's nephew and had been living at Somerhill. In 1792, Woodgate was one of three partners who set up The Tonbridge Bank. In the spring of 1810, J. M. W. Turner made a drawing of Somerhill, and then in 1811 he painted it for the Woodgates, choosing a view across the lake in the grounds, with the house in the distance. The painting, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811, is now in the National Galleries of Scotland, and the sketchbook containing his earlier drawing is at the Tate. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent agricultural depression, coupled with the collapse of the Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835 36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks. In 1842, Tonbridge Priory was demolished to make way for the building of the first railway station. A stone coffin from the priory was bought by Alexander and taken to Somerhill, where it can still be seen. In 1849, Somerhill was bought by Sir Isaac Goldsmid, who passed it on to his son Frederick in 1859. The lake at Somerhill, which Turner had painted in 1811, was used to supply ice for the house, as a watering place for the estate's cattle, and for recreational boating. The lake was fed by the Calverley Stream, which flowed through the grounds of Somerhill. In 1860, the stream became polluted by sewage discharged upstream from a sewage works owned by the Tunbridge Wells Improvement Commissioners, rendering the water in the lake unfit for use. Frederick Goldsmid tried to get the Commissioners to stop fouling the stream, but they refused to act and the situation worsened. Finally, in 1865, Goldsmid sued the Commissioners. They denied responsibility, claiming that the pollution was not caused by their sewage works but by a farm downstream. The court rejected their claim and ruled in Goldsmid's favor. In 1866, Somerhill passed to Frederick's son Sir Julian Goldsmid later known as d'Avigdor Goldsmid . Sir Julian returned the house to something nearer its original condition. In 1879, Somerhill was extended as more room was needed to accommodate Goldsmid's large family he had eight daughters. The stable courtyard was rebuilt at this time, with the date 1879 being cast in the rainwater heads. The building work took until 1897 to complete. The expansion made Somerhill the second largest house in Kent, after Knole House, Sevenoaks. Somerhill House itself covers an area of 212 acres 1 ha . A ghost in the form of a lady in white is said to haunt the Julian staircase, located in the Victorian part of the house. D'Avigdor Goldsmid allowed people to drive their carriages through the grounds of Somerhill, although the house was not open to the public. Sir Julian died in 1896, and Somerhill passed to Sir Osmond d'Avigdor Goldsmid. In 1912, there was an army camp held in the grounds of Somerhill. The soldiers were housed in bell tents. On Sir Osmond's death in 1940, it then passed to his eldest son Sir Henry. During the Second World War, Somerhill was the site of a Prisoner of War camp, known as POW Camp No. 40. Italian POWs were amongst those housed at Somerhill. The Army were in possession of Somerhill from 194049. Squatters occupied some of the 40 plus huts in 1948, they were locked in by the Colonel in charge of the camp at the time. Post war, the house was the scene of much lavish entertaining. Lady Rosemary d'Avigdor Goldsmid likened it to a hotel, except that the guests didn't pay Amongst the distinguished visitors were John Betjeman, Hugh Casson, David Niven and Enoch Powell. The house was listed on 20 October 1954. It is assessed as Grade I. On 19 September 1963, the d'Avigdor Goldsmid's daughter Sarah was drowned in an accident, which occurred off Rye, East Sussex. Artist Marc Chagall was commissioned to design a set of stained glass windows in All Saints' Church, Tudeley, in her memory. In 1976, Somerhill passed to Sir Henry's surviving daughter Chloe, who lived at Hadlow Place Farm, Hadlow. She sold Somerhill in 1981 and it was sold thrice more in the next eight years. A sale of the contents of Somerhill was held by Sotheby's on 23 and 24 June 1981. It was bought by Mr and Mrs Watts who opened it for weddings parties etc Somerhill was advertised for sale in May 1984 at a price in excess of 1,500,000. Beginning in 1988, the house was extensively restored with assistance from English Heritage. The works were undertaken by R. Durtnell Sons of Brasted, who celebrated their 400th anniversary in 1991 with a party held at Somerhill as the restoration was completed. Fielden and Mawson were the architects for the work. In 1993, The Schools at Somerhill moved to Somerhill House, having previously been at Tunbridge Wells. The Schools at Somerhill comprise three schools in one location. Somerhill Pre Prep is for boys and girls aged 3 6. Derwent Lodge is for girls aged 6 11 and Yardley Court is for boys aged 6 13. In 1998, the attic rooms were converted to provide classrooms and art room. A former granary has also been converted to classrooms, whilst some stables have been converted to workshops. Also in that year, a bridge over the lake in the grounds of Somerhill was added to the Buildings at Risk Register by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, in whose area Somerhill falls. In 2000, the central span between the old stable courtyard and the stable courtyard was reinstated at a cost of 720,000 to provide accommodation for Somerhill Pre Prep School and administrative offices. Also in that year, planning permission was granted for the building of a sports hall on the top sports terrace. The reinstated central span opened in January 2001. The new sports hall was completed in 2002 at a cost of 1,400,000. An artificial turf pitch was added in 2003. In 2004, the bridge over the lake was repaired at a cost of 170,000, aided by a grant of 32,000 from Tunbridge Wells Borough Council. In 2006, planning permission was granted for the conversion of the walled garden into a dining hall and indoor swimming pool. Work began the next year and was completed in January 2009. The dining room and swimming pool were given a Design Award by Tonbridge Civic Society in 2009. As a working school, Somerhill House is not normally open to the public. It has been open as part of Heritage Open Days. Somerhill House was open in 2006, and also in 2010. The grounds of Somerhill contain 152 acres 62 ha of land.

"The Somerset Coal Canal originally known as the Somersetshire Coal Canal was a narrow canal in England, built around 1800. Its route began in basins at Paulton and Timsbury, ran to nearby Camerton, over two aqueducts at Dunkerton, through a tunnel at Combe Hay, then via Midford and Monkton Combe to Limpley Stoke where it joined the Kennet and Avon Canal. This link gave the Somerset coalfield which at its peak contained 80 collieries access east toward London. The longest arm was 10.6 miles 17.1 km long with 23 locks. From Midford an arm also ran via Writhlington to Radstock, with a tunnel at Wellow. A feature of the canal was the variety of methods used at Combe Hay to overcome height differences between the upper and lower reaches initially by the use of caisson locks when this method failed an inclined plane trackway and finally a flight of 22 conventional locks. The Radstock arm was never commercially successful and was replaced first with a tramway in 1815 and later incorporated into the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The Paulton route flourished for nearly 100 years and was very profitable, carrying high tonnages of coal for many decades this canal helped carry the fuel that powered the nearby city of Bath. By the 1880s, coal production declined as the various pits either ran out of coal or were flooded and subsequently closed. In 1896 the main pump at Dunkerton, which maintained the canal water level, failed. The resultant lowering in level meant that only small loads could be transported, which reduced revenue, thus the canal company could not afford a replacement pump. The canal became disused after 1898 and officially closed in 1902, being sold off to the various railway companies who were expanding their networks. In September 2014, restoration work began on the canal section from Paulton to Radford, with the aim of restoring the entire canal to navigation in the future. The largest canal drydock in England has been revealed at Paulton culverts and bridges nearby are being reinstated or rebuilt and about 23 mile 1 km of canal from Paulton to Radford has been in water since summer 2015. In 1763 coal was discovered in Radstock and mining began in the area, however transport was a major problem because of the poor state of the roads. This cost and the potential for cheaper delivery of coal from south Wales via the Monmouthshire Canal led to the proposal for a canal which could transport the coal to Bath and Wiltshire. Initial surveys were conducted during 1793 by William Jessop and William Smith under the direction of John Rennie who presented the report on 14 October 1793 estimating the cost of construction of the canal at 80,000. Smith, who also worked at the Mearns Pit at High Littleton, made the original observations leading to his important stratification theory by observing the dips in the geological strata through which the canal was cut. Smith became Surveyor to the company, but was dismissed in April 1799, apparently because he had used his position as surveyor to buy a local house at advantageous terms. He then set himself up in a private practice in Bath but was re engaged by the company in 1811, to provide advice when repairs became necessary to the canal bed. The canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament entitled An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal, with certain Railways and Stone Roads, from several Collieries in the county of Somerset, to communicate with the intended Kennet and Avon Canal, in the parish of Bradford, in the county of Wilts of 1794, and further detailed surveys were carried out by Robert Whitworth and John Sutcliffe, who was then appointed as chief engineer. In May 1795 tenders were invited for the first section to be built from the meadows near Goosehard or Gooseyard near Paulton to Hopyard in the Parish of Camerton. In June 1795 a contractor, Houghton Son from Shropshire , started the terminus at Paulton meadows using local labour. This first section of the canal was completed on Monday 1 October 1798 the first load of coal along the canal was delivered to Bath via Dunkerton. Some 14 collieries at Timsbury Paulton were connected to their respective basins in the meadow terminus by tramways. This involved the construction of three tramway bridges over the Cam brook. A further bridge at Upper Radford was required over the canal at this point tramways connected the Withy Mills and Radford workings. The course of the Cam brook was modified at various places to protect the canal from erosion. In 1799 William Whitmore and his partner, Norton, offered to build a balance or geometrical lift without payment, on condition that if successful they were to have 17,300 and a royalty of 4 pence per ton of goods passed. The design of the caisson lock at Combe Hay was not a success, on 15 February 1798 the first descent failed. Mr. Weldon the inventor , made one successful descent on 7 June and said I will undertake to pass 1,500 tons of goods through the lock in 12 hrs . Tenders were invited on 28 June for further constructions. Two more attempts to use the caisson lock took place on 11 April and 2 May only the latter was successful . By 22 August 1799 the second rebuilding of the caisson had been abandoned. It was replaced by three locks and an inclined plane trackway, but the trackway was not successful either, and the company proposed to raise more money to finance the building of a flight of 19 locks to replace it, the use of which would incur an additional toll of one shilling per ton on all traffic. This was vigorously opposed by the owners of the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Wilts and Berks Canal, on the grounds that the price of coal to their customers would be too high. After negotiation, the company obtained a new Act of Parliament on 30 April 1802, which authorised the formation of a separate body called The Lock Fund of the Somerset Coal Canal Company , with powers to raise the sum of 45,000. The money was raised by the Kennet and Avon, the Wilts and Berks and the Somerset Coal Canal each contributing 15,000, and the one shilling surcharge was to be levied until the capital had been repaid, after which it would cease. The act set the tonnage rates to be charged Fractions of a Mile to pay for Half a Mile, and of a Ton as a Quarter of a Ton Rates for Wharfage to be determined by the Company. In addition to the above Rates, One Shilling per Ton is paid on all Goods to the Lock Fund, which also receives Three Farthings per Ton from the Coal Canal company. The boats were weighed at Midford where a Weigh house was constructed in 1831. The boats would be floated into a one ended lock, the gate closed and the water drained. This left the boat resting on a cradle suspended by angled rods attached to a beam which took the weight of the boat. One pound weights were then added to a pan with one pound being equivalent to one hundredweight 112 pounds or 51 kilograms until the system was in equilibrium and the weight was recorded. The weigh house at Midford was one of only four known to have been built in England and Wales. .mw parser output .RMbox box shadow 0 2px 2px 0 rgba 0,0,0,.14 ,0 1px 5px 0 rgba 0,0,0,.12 ,0 3px 1px 2px rgba 0,0,0,.2 .mw parser output .RMinline float none width 100 margin 0 border none .mw parser output table.routemap padding 0 border 0 border collapse collapse background transparent white space nowrap line height 1.2 margin auto .mw parser output table.routemap .RMcollapse margin 0 border collapse collapse vertical align middle .mw parser output table.routemap .RMreplace margin 0 border collapse collapse vertical align middle position absolute bottom 0 .mw parser output table.routemap .RMsi display inline font size 90 .mw parser output table.routemap .RMl1 padding 0 3px text align left .mw parser output table.routemap .RMr1 padding 0 3px text align right .mw parser output table.routemap .RMl text align right .mw parser output table.routemap .RMr text align left .mw parser output table.routemap .RMl4 padding 0 3px 0 0 text align left .mw parser output table.routemap .RMr4 padding 0 0 0 3px text align right .mw parser output table.routemap tbody tr line height 1 .mw parser output table.routemap tbody tr td,.mw parser output table.RMcollapse tbody tr td,.mw parser output table.RMreplace tbody tr td padding 0 width auto vertical align middle text align center .mw parser output .RMir div display inline block vertical align middle padding 0 height 20px min height 20px .mw parser output .RMir img height initial important max width initial important .mw parser output .RMir .RMov position relative .mw parser output .RMir .RMov .RMic,.mw parser output .RMir .RMov .RMtx position absolute left 0 top 0 padding 0 .mw parser output .RMir .RMtx line height 20px height 20px min height 20px vertical align middle text align center .mw parser output .RMir .RMsp height 20px min height 20px .mw parser output .RMir .RMtx abbr,.mw parser output .RMir .RMtx div line height .975 display inline block vertical align middle .mw parser output .RMir .RMts font size 10px transform scaleX .89 .mw parser output .RMir .RMf height 5px min height 5px width 20px min width 20px .mw parser output .RMir .RMfm height 100 min height 100 width 4px min width 4px margin 0 auto .mw parser output .RMir .RMo width 2.5px min width 2.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RMc width 5px min width 5px .mw parser output .RMir .RMoc width 7.5px min width 7.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RMd width 10px min width 10px .mw parser output .RMir .RMod width 12.5px min width 12.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RMcd width 15px min width 15px .mw parser output .RMir .RMocd width 17.5px min width 17.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RM width 20px min width 20px .mw parser output .RMir .RM o width 22.5px min width 22.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RM c width 25px min width 25px .mw parser output .RMir .RM oc width 27.5px min width 27.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RM d width 30px min width 30px .mw parser output .RMir .RM od width 32.5px min width 32.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RM cd width 35px min width 35px .mw parser output .RMir .RM ocd width 37.5px min width 37.5px .mw parser output .RMir .RMb width 40px min width 40px .mw parser output .RMir .RMcb width 45px min width 45px .mw parser output .RMir .RMdb width 50px min width 50px .mw parser output .RMir .RMcdb width 55px min width 55px .mw parser output .RMir .RM b width 60px min width 60px .mw parser output .RMir .RM cb width 65px min width 65px .mw parser output .RMir .RM db width 70px min width 70px .mw parser output .RMir .RM cdb width 75px min width 75px .mw parser output .RMir .RMs width 80px min width 80px .mw parser output .RMir .RMds width 90px min width 90px .mw parser output .RMir .RM s width 100px min width 100px .mw parser output .RMir .RM ds width 110px min width 110px .mw parser output .RMir .RMbs width 120px min width 120px .mw parser output .RMir .RMdbs width 130px min width 130px .mw parser output .RMir .RM bs width 140px min width 140px .mw parser output .RMir .RM dbs width 150px min width 150px .mw parser output .RMir .RMw width 160px min width 160px .mw parser output .RMir .RM w width 180px min width 180px .mw parser output .RMir .RMbw width 200px min width 200px .mw parser output .RMir .RM bw width 220px min width 220px .mw parser output .RMir .RMsw width 240px min width 240px .mw parser output .RMir .RM sw width 260px min width 260px .mw parser output .RMir .RMbsw width 280px min width 280px .mw parser output .RMir .RM bsw width 300px min width 300px The canal opened in 1805 and was used for passenger traffic as well as coal. In 1814 the Benedictine monks who came to Downside Abbey are said to have used the canal for the last stage of their journey. Another cargo carried by the canal was limestone from Combe Down. The peak level of cargo carried was in 1838 at 138,403 tons resulting in over 17,000 of tolls being paid. Cargoes of over 100,000 tons were common until the 1870s when the decline in output of coal from the various Somerset coalpits, along with competition from the railways, dramatically reduced the canal's profitability. When the main pump at Dunkerton failed it was not replaced and there was not sufficient water for continual operation of the locks. The canal went into liquidation in 1894 it closed in 1898 and was finally abandoned in 1904 when it was sold to the Great Western Railway for 2,000, and used as a branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. The closure caused problems across the Somerset coalfield especially to the pits along the Paulton branch, which had relied on the canal for transportation. When the Radstock branch was constructed, it was intended to link it to the main line of the Paulton branch at Midford, which was at a lower level at this point. The Lock Fund created in 1802 was to have paid for the construction of the locks, but because there was little regular traffic on the branch, the company built one lock, an aqueduct over the Midford Brook, and a short tramway to bridge the gap. This contributed to the economic failure of the branch, and its replacement by a tramway in 1815. The tramway was laid along the former canal's towpath. It was single line with passing places every 600 yards 550 m , and was originally laid using cast iron plates on stone block sleepers, but was relaid using wrought iron plates. Data from Jim Shead's Waterways Information. The fall over the route is 135 ft 41 m , which meant problems with supplying adequate water. The Cam brook was an inadequate source of water above Camerton, and the mills along it had water rights. Each narrow boat travelling through the series of locks 22 of them each 6 ft 1.8 m deep with a 25 ton load of coal caused 85 tons of water to be discharged into the brook below the locks. As a result, the canal was designed with all 22 locks in one flight near Combe Hay and a pumping engine to raise water from the Cam this was the first canal to entirely depend on pumping. A potential solution to the water supply problem was the use of caisson locks as proposed by Robert Weldon, three of which could replace the 22 conventional locks, because it wasted no water, however the technology had only been tried in a one third scale prototype. Each lock was 80 ft 24 m long and 60 ft 18 m deep and contained a closed wooden box which could take a barge. This box moved up and down in the 60 ft 18 m deep pool of water, which never left the lock. The box was demonstrated to the Prince Regent later George IV , but had engineering problems and was never successful commercially or built elsewhere. It was temporarily replaced with an inclined plane by Benjamin Outram who had successfully installed inclined planes at the Peak Forest Canal in Derbyshire, whilst 22 locks and a Boulton Watt Steam Pumping Station, capable of lifting 5,000 tons of water in 12 hours, were built to the latest design with metal plate clad wooden gates. The two images show a spillway drain from c. 1796 uncovered in 200910 at Upper Midford, a location where a caisson to take the canal from the 180 ft 55 m level to the 134 ft 41 m level at Midford Aqueduct was proposed. Each caisson would have had such a drain for maintenance purposes over the exit arch made to the same dimensions.

For further Newspaper articles see s Bath Georgian Newspaper Somerset Coal Canal located between the villages of Paulton and Timsbury was the terminus of the northern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal and was a central point for at least 15 collieries around Paulton, Timsbury and High Littleton, which were connected to the canal by tramroads. Timsbury basin was some 600 ft 180 m to the west of Paulton basin. On the northern side of Timsbury basin was the terminus for the tramroads which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits. Parts of this line were still in use in 1873, probably all carrying horse drawn wagons of coal. Tramroads on the southern side of the Paulton basin served Brittens, Littleborrok, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill terminating at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871 as were the collieries it served. The area has been designated as an 'area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance' under section 69 of the Planning Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990. The first railway to affect the canal was the Bristol and North Somerset Railway's Frome to Radstock line completed in 1854 which took traffic away from the tramway. It finally closed in 1874 with the Somerset and Dorset Railway's extension to Bath, built along its route from Radstock to Midford. Another branch line was constructed in 1882 from Hallatrow to Camerton, running alongside the canal for the last 1 12 miles 2 km of its route. The Great Western Railway built a railway line the Bristol and North Somerset Railway over some parts of the canal route from Limpley Stoke to Camerton, where it joined the existing 1882 branch line from Hallatrow to Camerton. This opened in 1910 for passenger and goods traffic, closed for the First World War, re opened after the war but ran for passengers only for two more years in the mid 1920s and finally closed to all traffic in the 1950s. The line was used in the 1950s Ealing comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt. The route of the canal lies in a largely agricultural area dotted with small villages and minor roads. There are several stretches of the Paulton and Timsbury basins branch of the canal that are easily visible, and various stretches and features have been surveyed during 2014. Full restoration of the entire length from Paulton to Dundas is being explored. Four locks on the original canal route at Combe Hay have been buried one by a 20 foot 6 m railway embankment, and three overfilled by 10 to 20 feet 36 m with building waste since the 1960s. It may no longer be feasible to reinstate the original locks 16, 17, 18 and 19 structures for this section. At Upper Midford the canal is blocked entirely at the Accommodation bridge by the 40 foot 12 m high embankment of the railway that crosses it. Most of the canal features along the entire route are on private land but the towpath survives in places as a right of way, while the later railway between Midford to Wellow has been surfaced to form part of National Cycle Route 24. It has been proposed that a statue, commissioned by Sustrans, of William Smith, the father of English Geology, will be sited next to the path on the line of the canal commemorating his work as its surveyor and his recognition of the significance of rock strata. The 14 mile 400 m stretch at Brassknocker Basin where the canal joins the Kennet and Avon at Dundas Aqueduct was restored during the 1980s and is now a thriving marina with moorings. Excavations of the old stop lock at the junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal showed that this had originally been a broad 14 feet, 4.3 m lock that at some point was narrowed to 7 feet 2.1 m by moving the lock wall. Work started in 2013 to reveal and excavate the drydock next to the eastern Paulton Basin. This drydock appears to be the largest drydock anywhere on the canal system in England, being about 30 feet 9.1 m wide and 83 feet 25 m long, large enough for three full length narrowboats to be worked on at the same time. The drainage culvert at the southeast corner of the drydock was rebuilt in December 2013, and the drydock itself completely excavated in April 2014. The entrance to the drydock, at the western end, was surmounted by a bridge, partially demolished in 2002 but rebuilt during 2014. Excavations began in May, 2014 at Terminus Bridge the arch was missing and the abutments were found to be in poor condition an earth bund between the abutments carried the public footpath and stopped the water draining from the Paulton and Timsbury Basins. A new earth bund was installed about 25 m 27 yd west of Terminus Bridge to stop the water and allow work to continue on the bridge. During excavations a drainage culvert was discovered about 20 m 22 yd west of Terminus bridge. Work resumed in September and November 2014 to batter and reshape the canal embankments. Excess topsoil was removed and the towpath reinstated on the stretch to the east from Terminus bridge for about 200 m 220 yd . On the same stretch a retaining wall was discovered in the south embankment continuing for about 100 m 110 yd , possibly built as a repair to a weak section of canal banking. Vertical infills of white clay have been used along this wall. The canal has been studied for many years with exploration and restoration work being undertaken in Wellow and elsewhere. Particular effort, so far unsuccessful, has been put into trying to find the site of the second and third caisson locks at Combe Hay. In October 2006 a grant of 20,000 was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund, by the Somersetshire Coal Canal Society in association with Bath North East Somerset Council and the Avon Industrial Buildings Trust to carry out a technical study on one of the locks and associated structures at Combe Hay. Many of the locks and associated workings are listed buildings. Coordinates 512002N 22432W 51.334N 2.409W 51.334 2.409",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset%20Coal%20Canal
"The Somerset Coalfield in northern Somerset, England is an area where coal was mined from the 15th century until 1973. It is part of a larger coalfield which stretched into southern Gloucestershire. The Somerset coalfield stretched from Cromhall in the north to the Mendip Hills in the south, and from Bath in the east to Nailsea in the west, a total area of about 240 square miles 622 km2 . Most of the pits on the coalfield were concentrated in the Cam Brook, Wellow Brook and Nettlebridge Valleys and around Radstock and Farrington Gurney. The pits were grouped geographically, with clusters of pits close together working the same coal seams often under the same ownership. Many pits shared the trackways and tramways which connected them to the Somerset Coal Canal or railways for distribution. The early pits were adits where coal outcropped or bell pits where coal was close to the surface. These methods were abandoned when deep seams were mined. The deepest shaft on the coalfield was at the Strap mine at Nettlebridge which reached 1,838 feet 560 m . Flooding and coal dust explosions in some mines required improved ventilation and pumping engines. Several pits closed in the 19th century as the coal was worked out. Those that survived until 1947 became part of the National Coal Board, but the expense of improving equipment and working conditions meant that these became uneconomical and the last pit closed in 1973. There is still evidence of the mine workings, with the remains of buildings, spoil heaps and tramways in the area. The Somerset Coalfield covers a total area of about 240 square miles 622 km2 . It consists of three synclines, informally referred to as 'coal basins'. The Pensford Syncline in the north and the Radstock Syncline in the south are separated by the east west trending Farmborough Fault Belt. Further to the west is the smaller Nailsea Syncline. The Radstock Syncline in particular is cut by a series of east west thrust faults and north south trending normal faults. The Coal Measures are divided into a Lower, Middle and Upper with coal seams found within each of these divisions. Lower and Middle Coal Measures are found at depths between 500 and 5,000 feet 150 and 1,520 m . Together the Lower and Middle Coal Measures are 1,600 feet 490 m thick with the Middle Coal Measures averaging about 500 and 5,000 feet and the Lower Coal Measures about 600 feet 180 m . Only in the southern part of the Radstock Syncline have coals of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures been worked, mainly at the Newbury and Vobster collieries in the southeast and in the New Rock and Moorewood pits to the southwest. Only in the eastern part of Pensford Syncline have coals of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures been worked, at the Globe Pit in the Newton St Loe area in the 19th century. The Variscan orogeny involved lateral compression of the rock sequence resulting in the tight folding, fracturing and faulting of the sandstone and mudstone strata, and the associated Coal Measures. Along the Radstock Slide Fault the distance between the broken ends of a coal seam can be as much as 1,500 feet 457 m . The complex geology and thin seams gained the field notoriety and three underground explosions, in 1893, 1895 and 1908 were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne coal dust. Exploratory surveys of the local geology were carried out by William Smith, who became known as the father of English geology , building on work by John Strachey. Smith worked for the Stracheys who owned Sutton Court, at one of their older mines, the Mearns Pit at High Littleton. As he observed the rock strata at the pit, he realised that they were arranged in a predictable pattern that the various strata could always be found in the same relative positions and each particular stratum could be identified by the fossils it contained and the same succession of fossil groups from older to younger rocks could be found in other parts of England. Smith noticed an easterly dip in the beds of rocksmall near the surface about three degrees then greater after the Triassic rocks which led to him a testable hypothesis, which he termed the principle of faunal succession, and he began to determine if the relationships between the strata and their characteristics were consistent throughout the country. During work as a surveyor appointed by engineer John Rennie for the Somerset Coal Canal Company and subsequently, he mapped the locations of rock strata, and their vertical extent, and drew cross sections and tables of what he saw and earned the name Strata Smith . The following coal seams are recognised within the coalfield. They are listed stratigraphically i.e. uppermost youngest first. Note that not all seams are continuous across the coalfield and that correlation of some seams from one basin to another is uncertain. It is believed that coal was mined in the area during Roman times and there is documentary evidence of coal being dug on the Mendips in 1305 and at Kilmersdon in 1437. By the time of Henry VIII there were coal pits at Clutton, High Littleton and Stratton on the Fosse. During the early 17th century coal was largely obtained by excavating the outcrops and driving drifts which followed the seam into the ground. Only small amounts of coal could be obtained by these methods and bell pits were also dug. These were vertical pits, with a 4 foot diameter 1.2 m shaft up to 60 feet 18 m deep, which were opened out at the bottom. When all the coal that could safely be extracted from the pit had been recovered, another pit was sunk close by to intersect the seam and the waste from the second pit thrown into the first. At the beginning of the 19th century there were about 4,000 people employed on the coalfield. The Somerset Miners' Association was founded in 1872, later becoming an area of the National Union of Mineworkers. The uses of coal were varied. Coal was used in limekilns to produce lime for mortar used in building and by farmers to improve the soil. From 1820 coal was used to produce gas for lighting and to power steam driven woollen mills in the area. Coke was used to dry malt for the brewing industry. The coalfield had a relatively low population density and did not have a major coal consuming industry nearby. Transporting coal to market was a key problem for the coalfield's development. In the pre turnpike era, the roads serving the coalfield were unsuited to moving coal. Bulley notes The problem ... was rendered far worse by the state of the roads in Somerset, which were notorious down to the middle of the 18th century. Parishes in the area sometimes neglected or refused to repair those roads which were heavily used by coal carts. Thus in 1617 the inhabitants of Stoke St Michael ... complained that of late by reason of many coalmines ... the highways there are much in decay and grown very founderous . In Somerset, turnpike roads began in 1707 with the establishment of the Bath Trust, but turnpikes did not reach the coalfield until the mid 1700s. The Bristol Trust, which passed close to the western boundary of the coalfield, established in 1727 was of little importance, as Bristol was never a significant market, having its own coalfield. Turnpikes facilitated the movement of coal, and John Billingsley enthused Nothing so much contributes to the improvement of a county as good roads. Before the establishment of turnpikes, many parts of the county were scarcely accessible. ... coal was carried on horses' backs to the distance of fifteen or twenty miles from the colliery each horse carried about two hundred and half weight. Now one horse with a light cart will draw four hundred weight or four times more than a horse could carry. Can an insignificant toll be put in competition with this saving Not all roads were improved, and in 1819 John Skinner observed roads rendered bad by the passage of coal wagons. Expansion of production was limited by access to market. Such a need implied a canal project, following Lord Middleton's dictum Water transport is what all coal owners must aim at . There were large gains from being connected to a canal system, as stated by the Coal Commission At about this period 1800 the system of coal navigation was being rapidly extended, and the result was that coals were gradually finding their way into districts that could not be reached unless at great cost, by road . A scheme for an extension of the Avon Navigation was proposed in 1766, but canals did not reach the coalfield for almost another 50 years. In 1794 coal proprietors formed a committee to construct the Somerset Coal Canal with two branches into the Cam Brook and Wellow Brook Valleys, and from a junction at Midford, to join the proposed Kennet and Avon Canal at the Dundas Aqueduct near Bath. Coal was transported by the Somerset Coal Canal and later by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway and Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which were accessed from the pits by a series of tramways. After 1854, when the first railway line was opened, the tonnage carried by the coal canal declined rapidly. The total tonnage of coal produced by the coalfield increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79 separate collieries and production was 1.25 million tons per annum. The peak years for production were 1900 to 1920. However, decline took hold and the number of pits reduced from 30 at the beginning of the 20th century to 14 by the mid 1930s, twelve at nationalisation when the National Coal Board was created on 1 January 1947, under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, five in 1959 and none after 1973. Despite some investment in new infrastructure, particularly at Norton Hill, thin seams made production expensive, limiting profit and investment. The conversion of Portishead power station from coal to oil and reduced national demand together with competition from more economical coalfields led to the closure of the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, in September 1973. Although there are still the remains of mines, disused or redeveloped buildings and a few spoil tips, most have been removed or landscaped, the area has returned to a largely rural nature between the Mendip Hills and the River Avon in north east Somerset. The towns and villages have some light industry but are often commuter towns for Bath and Bristol. There are several limestone quarries particularly in the Mendips. The Colliers Way NCR24 national cycle route passes landmarks associated with the coalfield, and other roads and footpaths follow tramways developed during the coal mining years. The cycleway runs from Dundas Aqueduct to Frome via Radstock, and is intended to provide part of a continuous cycle route to Southampton and Portsmouth. Radstock Museum has exhibits which offer an insight into life in north Somerset since the 19th century. Exhibits relate to the coalfield and its geology. Artefacts and memorabilia from the Somerset Coal Canal, Somerset and Dorset and Great Western Railways are also on display. The Pensford coal basin is in the northern part of the coalfield around Bishop Sutton, Pensford, Stanton Drew, Farmborough and Hunstrete. At least one pit was operating near Bishop Sutton before 1719. Four bell pits in Bishop Sutton were marked on field tithe No 1409, and four shaft pits on field tithe No 1428, but were no longer working by 1824. The Old Pit at Bishop Sutton, which was also known as Sutton Top Pit or Upper Sutton Pit was dug before 1799 and owned by Lieutenant Henry Fisher, who sold it in 1821 to Robert Blinman Dowling. After Dowling's death in 1852 the Old Pit was sold to Mr T.T. Hawkes, but he defaulted on the payments and it was sold in 1853 to William Rees Mogg ancestor of journalist William Rees Mogg and his associates. The shaft reached a depth of 304 feet 93 m , but the pit went out of production by 1855, when New Pit , which had been sunk in the early 19th century but then closed, was reopened and deepened to exploit deeper seams. New Pit had two shafts of 4 feet 1.2 m in diameter, one for winding and one for pumping. In 1896 it was owned by F. Spencer of New Rock Colliery, and in 1908 by Jesse Lovell and Sons. By 1921 the pit employed 150 men and boys and produced 10,000 tins per annum. The pit finally closed in 1929. Pensford Colliery, which opened in 1909, had the latest equipment at the time including coal cutters. It had a red brick winding house, pithead baths and a coal washery. Faulting made coal production expensive and it closed in 1958. The Earl of Warwick's estates included sawmills, quarries, brickworks and collieries in addition to agricultural holdings. Bell pits, around Clutton and High Littleton, were described in a survey of 1610. All were closed by 1836. The first deep mine in the parish of High Littleton was Mearns Coalworks which began in 1783. The Greyfield Coal Company did not start until 1833 and expanded after the opening of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway in 1847. Greyfield Colliery closed in 1911, and the railway in 1964. Maynard Terrace in Clutton was built to house some of the miners. Collieries in the Paulton basin were connected to the terminal basin of the northern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal which was the focus for tramroads that connected at least 15 collieries around Paulton, Timsbury and High Littleton. On the northern side of canal was the terminus for the tramroad which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits. Parts of this line were still in use in 1873, probably carrying horse drawn wagons of coal. The southern side of the canal basin was connected to the pits at Brittens, Littlebrook, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill by a tramway which terminated at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871 as were the collieries it served. The area has been designated as an 'area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance' under section 69 of the Planning Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas Act 1990. The first of the collieries around Timsbury village was sunk in 1791 and known as Conygre Conigre in old spellings . Camerton Old Pit opened in 1781 and the shaft went down to 921 feet 281 m . It closed around circa 1898 but the shaft was then used as an airway and escape route for the New Pit, until 1930 when it was closed and capped. The New Pit was half a mile east of the Old Pit and went down to 1,818 feet 554 m . In 1928 it was joined underground to Braysdown Colliery and eventually closed in 1950. There is very little obvious landscape evidence remaining of the previous mining activities around Clutton, Temple Cloud, High Littleton and Timsbury. However, there is a very large Batch almost in the middle of Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch was bare, like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided to pay for it to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton. East of Camerton the coal is buried beneath newer rock strata, which meant that mining in the area was more difficult. The dominant features of the valleys of the Cam and Wellow Brooks are remnants of coal mining from the 18th to the 20th centuries. In both valleys there are frequent shafts and batches together with the remains of the railway and tram lines that connected the mines to the Avon Valley. Remains of the Somersetshire Coal Canal are also significant reminders of this coal mining history in this area. Mining around Farrington Gurney has been undertaken since the 17th century where, by 1780, the pits were known as Farrington Colliery. The main geological feature south of Hallatrow consists of Supra Pennant Measures which include the upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone. Relics of its industrial past are evident in the area, including the highly visible and distinct conical shaped Old Mills Batch with its generally unvegetated surface. The three disused colliery sites have been developed for light industry, a depot and a superstore. The Duchy of Cornwall owned most of the mineral rights around Midsomer Norton and various small pits opened around 1750 to exploit these. In 1763 coal was discovered in Radstock and mining began on land owned by the Waldegrave family, Lords of the Manor since the English Civil War. In 1896 the pits were owned by the Trustee of Frances, late Countess of Waldegrave. Radstock was the terminus for the southern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal which was subsequently turned into a tramway and became the centre for railway development and coal depots, coal washeries, workshops and a gas works. As part of the development of the Wiltshire, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, an 8 mile 13 km line from Radstock to Frome was built to carry coal. In the 1870s the broad gauge line was converted to standard gauge and connected to the Bristol and North Somerset Line connecting it to the Great Western Railway. The Radstock railway site comprises approximately 8.8 hectares of land which has been subject to planning and development applications. The Writhlington Collieries, close to the Waldegrave Collieries, were further east of Radstock and under different ownership. In 1896 they were owned by the Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote Colliery Co., and in 1908 by the Writhlington Collieries Co. Ltd. The Upper and Lower Writhlington, Huish Foxcote pits were merged into a single colliery. The base of the Kilmersdon valley consists of alluvium deposits. Above these, on both sides of all of the valleys, is a band of shales and clays from the Penarth group from the Triassic period. Most of the upland in this area is Lias Limestone white and blue while the highest part, above 130 m, south of Haydon, is an outcrop of Inferior Oolitic Limestone, both are from the Jurassic period. The steepest slopes of both the Kilmersdon and Snail's Bottom valleys have frequently slipped. Below these rocks are the coal bearing Carboniferous strata. Haydon is an outlying settlement of Radstock built to house miners from the local pit. The disused railway line and inclined railway at Haydon are important elements in the Kilmersdon valley east of Haydon. The modern landscape has a less maintained and 'rougher' character and texture than neighbouring agricultural areas caused mainly by the remnants of the coal industry and its infrastructure and changes in agricultural management. Disturbance caused by coal mining and the railways and the subsequent end of mining and abandonment of the railways has created valuable habitats for nature conservation. The Writhlington spoil heap or batch is a Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI because of the rich collection of fossils in the spoil. The Braysdown batch was planted with conifers, and is known as Braysdown Hill. The offices, blacksmith's shop and stables at the Upper Writhlington Colliery were converted into dwellings. Norton Hill Collieries at Westfield were owned by members of the Beauchamp family such as Sir Frank Beauchamp and his brother Louis Beauchamp who owned other collieries and related works on the coalfield at various times. They were also known as the Beauchamp goldmines as they were the most productive mines in the whole coalfield. In 1900 a railway linking the colliery to the main Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was constructed, and sidings laid in 1905 and 1907 which were reconstructed in 1953. On 9 April 1908 an explosion approximately 1,500 feet 460 m underground killed ten men and boys. As there were no mines rescue teams at that time, the manager and volunteers searched for survivors for 10 days. In 1911, partly as a result of the Norton Hill explosion, Winston Churchill was instrumental in the passing of the Coal Mines Act 1911. After nationalisation after World War II the National Coal Board spent 500,000 on modernising the mine's infrastructure to give it the capability for annual production of 315,000 tons however, manpower shortages and geological problems caused the pit to close in 1966. There were numerous coal workings in the area from Gurney Slade east to Mells around the villages of Holcombe, Coleford and Stratton on the Fosse. These included at least 52 bell pits, some with deeper shafts and 16 adits. Some coal may have been mined during Roman times and in the 13th century, making them the earliest coal mines in Somerset, but most development occurred in the 17th century. Most mining ended in the 19th century however, Strap Colliery was opened in 1953 as Mendip Colliery and worked until 1969. The Vobster Breach colliery had a unique system of long coking ovens which, along with the other buildings, have been designated as a Scheduled monument. The boiler chimney of Oxley's Colliery near Buckland Dinham which operated for a few years in the 1880s is a Grade II listed building.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset%20Coalfield
"Somerset County Cricket Club made their debut in first class cricket in the 1882 English cricket season. They were captained by Stephen Newton, and played eight first class matches, five against county opposition, two against the Marylebone Cricket Club and one against the touring Australian team. They only won one of the eight contests, that against Hampshire at Taunton. Of the other matches, one was drawn and the other six were all losses for Somerset. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described the season as disastrous , but the publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883. Part of the reason for Somerset's poor performances was their inability to consistently field their best players at least four of their better cricketers were unable to commit to the full fixture list, and in all the county played 30 different people in their eight matches. Faint praise was offered to the batting of William Herbert Fowler, Newton and Edward Sainsbury in The Sportsman, but the bowling was considered by Wisden to be sub standard, particularly that of Arnold Fothergill. Somerset County Cricket Club was formed in 1875, and played irregular county fixtures in the years after that, during which time they struggled to remain financially solvent. Upon their formation, the club had no fixed home ground, and it was declared that they would play on any ground in the county that may be selected by the committee. However, in 1881, they moved into the newly built Athletic Grounds in Taunton. Although it is widely accepted that Somerset's debut first class match came in 1882, some records do include earlier matches in 1879 and 1881 against Gloucestershire as being of first class status. In their eight first class matches in 1882, Somerset fielded 30 different players. Only three appeared in all eight matches Arnold Fothergill, William Herbert Fowler, and Edward Sainsbury, while fourteen players appeared in only one match that season. The club captain, Stephen Newton, missed the first three matches of the season as he was a schoolmaster in London, and was not available until the summer holidays. Newton was not the only talented player to only make limited appearances for the side in their review of the season, the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack explained that Alfred Evans, Robert Ramsay and Bill Roe were all unavailable at various points, and that these absences were among many good reasons to account for a disastrous season. The following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first class cricket in 1882. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season 8 June 1882 . Somerset made their debut in first class cricket against Lancashire on 8 June 1882. The Western Daily Press noted that Somerset were not able to field a full strength team in the match, missing Evans, Ramsay and Roe. However, the Lancashire team which faced them was described by the same paper as being very second rate . The weather was showery most of the day, and play was abandoned at half five because of the rain, with Lancashire on 231 for 8 having won the toss and batted first. Heavy rain overnight made the ground unplayable on the second day, so play resumed the following day, although rain continued to threaten. The original wicket was badly damaged, being described in the York Herald as a puddle , and so the stumps were moved to enable play to begin. Somerset took the final two Lancashire wickets in the first ten minutes, bowling them out for 237. Fowler and Sainsbury opened the batting for Somerset, and put on eighteen runs together before being dismissed in quick succession. The Western Daily Press recorded that after this disaster waited on the visitors. Only two other batsmen scored any runs for Somerset, and they were all out for 29 runs, the second lowest first class total at the time. Somerset followed on, and their second innings proceeded in much the same fashion as the first the pair scored 35 runs, while the rest of the team only added a further 6. Somerset lost the match by an innings and 157 runs. The Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette defended Somerset's performance on the third day slightly, noting that the poor condition of the pitch favoured the Lancashire bowlers. Lancashire's George Nash took eight wickets in the first innings, including four in one four ball over, while fellow spin bowler Jack Crossland collected six in the second innings. In Somerset's second match, they faced their nearest opposition, Gloucestershire. Once again, the weather was poor, and the Spa Ground in Gloucester, which was hosting the match, was specially looked after during the heavy rain preceding the match to ensure that it would be in a good condition for the game. As it was, the Bristol Mercury described the wicket as being in fairly good order , and play started just over half an hour late on the first day. Somerset's batting failed to make a significant total Fowler was the only batsman to reach double figures, totalling more than half of his team's runs with 39. W. G. Grace took eight wickets for Gloucestershire to bowl Somerset out for 62. In Gloucestershire's reply, E. M. Grace and Billy Midwinter scored centuries to help them establish a lead of 286 runs. In their response, Somerset scored 109, including a partnership of 61 between Sainsbury and Fred Welman which was praised in the Birmingham Daily Post. Despite an improved batting performance, Somerset lost the match by an innings and 177 runs. Facing Hampshire in Southampton for the third match, Somerset won the toss and opted to bat first. The pitch was soft, due to the heavy rainfall through the morning, and play started shortly after midday. Sainsbury was yet again one of few Somerset players to reach double figures, and they were bowled out for 101. Cecil Currie, a spin bowler for Hampshire, collected eight of the wickets. Somerset managed to restrict Hampshire's lead to 46 runs Francis Reed took four wickets, and Fothergill three. Fowler and Fothergill were Somerset's most successful batsmen in their second innings, played mostly in light rain, helping the county to reach 118 runs. That left Hampshire requiring 73 runs to win, which the hosts achieved without losing any wickets, to beat Somerset with ten wickets to spare. The Somerset team travelled to Lord's in London in early August to face the Marylebone Cricket Club MCC . Somerset batted first after winning the toss, but lost three batsmen for ducks early in the innings. Somerset's captain, Newton playing his first match of the season for the county, batted for the rest of the innings to score 57 runs, and shared a large partnership with Francis Reed. The MCC started well in their innings, but the introduction of Fowler into the bowling attack brought their batting to a quick conclusion Fowler took four wickets while only conceding eight runs, and claimed a hat trick by bowling Edward Hawtrey, Charles Burke and Thomas Mycroft in successive deliveries. Somerset had a 25 run lead going into the second innings, in which Newton once again top scored. In addition to his total of 67, Lyonel Hildyard made an unbeaten 59, and Fowler scored 23 runs from just six scoring shots, including a six which went out of the ground. The Western Daily Press described Fowler as possibly the hardest hitter amongst English cricketers , while his history of the county, David Foot suggests that Fowler was perhaps the earliest Somerset batsman to parade the fundamental skills of slogging. Somerset totalled 219, to leave the MCC needing to score 245 runs to win. Principally due to the batting of John Russel, the MCC reached the target, but only had one wicket remaining Fothergill having taken five wickets and Charles Winter four. A few days later, Somerset played their first home fixture, at the Taunton Athletic Grounds, hosting Hampshire. In contrast to many of their previous game, the weather was good, and on winning the toss, Hampshire decided to bat first. Charles Seymour batted well for the visitors, accruing 57 out of Hampshire's 146 runs, but Fowler was again the best of the Somerset bowlers, collecting four wickets for nine runs to help restrict the Hampshire total. Ramsay top scored for Somerset in their reply, accumulating 71 runs before being bowled, while a number of other batsmen made useful scores to help Somerset to their total of 214. Edward Western, the Somerset secretary batted in his only innings of the season for the county, coming in as the last man, but he failed to score a run. Somerset struggled to collect wickets when Hampshire batted again, and tried eight different bowlers without much success. Their fielding was described by the Bristol Mercury as being loose , but when the sixth wicket was taken, with 232 runs scored, the rest followed reasonably quickly, and Hampshire finished on 290. Fowler was dismissed early in Somerset's chase, but Newton and Sainsbury put on 118 runs together to help their towards victory. Sainsbury was dismissed for 63, but Newton continued to bat, putting on 80 runs before being dismissed. Somerset eventually reached the required total with five wickets remaining to achieve their first win of the season. The next day after defeating Hampshire, Somerset faced the MCC at Taunton. The MCC had brought a strong team, including eight professionals, and on winning the toss they elected to bat. After a cautious start, the second wicket partnership of Billy Gunn and William Hearn put on 173 runs together, and according to the Western Daily Press, the Somerset bowling was completely mastered. Somerset tried eight different bowlers to try to get a wicket, but the partnership was eventually broken when Hearn was run out for 91. Frank Hearne then joined Gunn at the crease, and the pair continued the MCC's dominance, adding a further 130 runs. Another run out, again due to the fielding of Newton, brought Gunn's innings to an end, after the MCC batsman had scored 188 runs. Wickets then began to fall more frequently Roe collected three, while Fothergill and Winter had two apiece, and the MCC were eventually all out for 506 on the second morning. In their response, Somerset lost the early wickets of Sainsbury and Newton, but then a partnership between Fowler and Roe took the score up to 181, during which Fowler reached his century, coming in just 55 minutes. Once that partnership was ended with the dismissal of Roe, Somerset regularly lost wickets. Fowler was caught in the slips for 139, which had included three sixes, and Somerset ended their innings on 286. They followed on, and lost five early wickets before a partnership between Francis Terry, who scored 77 runs, and Fothergill steadied the innings and help Somerset secure a draw. Somerset's final county match of the season came against the same opposition as their first, Lancashire. The low attendance at the match was criticised in the press, and the Western Daily Press in particular described that it was painfully obvious that Tauntonians, as a body, take no interest in first class cricket. Six wickets from Evans helped Somerset to limit Lancashire to 178 runs in their first innings, but Somerset failed to capitalise Fowler and Newton scored 24 and 23 runs respectively, but no other batsman reached double figures. Somerset were dismissed for 74 runs, more than 100 behind, and were asked to follow on by Lancashire. Batting again, the Somerset players put in an improved performance, and reached 157 runs, of which Roe scored 45. Lancashire were required to bat again, but reached the winning target of 53 runs for the loss of only one wicket. Towards the end of August, the touring Australian team visited Taunton, attracting the largest crowd of the season, roughly 1,500 people. Somerset were not considered to have much chance in the match, though Australia were missing three of their better players. The Leeds Mercury offered Somerset faint praise, suggesting that they had no great cause to be dissatisfied with their performances. The Australians batted first, and were restricted to 245 by Somerset. Alick Bannerman was the highest scorer for the tourists, with 50 runs, while Evans and Fothergill took three wickets each. In their response, Somerset's batsmen struggled against the bowling of Fred Spofforth, who was known as the Demon . Spofforth took nine wickets, while conceding only 51 runs, and Somerset were forced to follow on no batsman scored more than 17 runs in the first innings for the county. In the second innings, Somerset performed slightly better Newton scored 32 runs, and five other batsmen reached double figures. The Australian bowling once again proved too much though, and Somerset lost the match by an innings and 19 runs. The Western Daily Press praised the accurate bowling of both Spofforth and Harry Boyle during the match. Notes References",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club%20in%201882
"The 1885 season was an annus horribilis for Somerset County Cricket Club. Captained by Ted Sainsbury, who had taken over from Stephen Newton, captain for the previous three seasons, they played six first class cricket matches. Somerset's only win of the season came in their first match all the other were lost. Two of the losses, those away against Gloucestershire and Surrey, number among the county's ten heaviest defeats. Somerset were unable to field a full team for their fourth match, which coupled with their poor results and lack of fixtures resulted in the club being stripped of its first class status at the end of the season. At an emergency meeting held in Taunton a new club secretary was appointed and wealthy benefactors were sought, but Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. Somerset played second class cricket for five seasons, until their readmission to the first class game for the 1891 season. In their histories of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck and David Foot mostly gloss over the season Roebuck includes a scorecard, but provides only two paragraphs of prose, while Foot only mentions the loss of first class cricket. Somerset had been granted first class status in advance of the 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous, but the publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883. The county failed to live up to this optimism, and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them, and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club at the end of the 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London. In their six first class matches in 1885, Somerset fielded 26 different players. Only two appeared in all six matches the captain Edward Sainsbury, and Charles Winter. James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual suggested in 1883 that professionals not being indigenous to the area it is feared that their advance is only temporary . This prediction was particularly accurate during 1885 only Albert Clapp was a professional. Ten of Somerset's players that year only appeared once during the season, and of those, all but George Mirehouse, Crescens Robinson, and Francis Terry, made fewer than five career first class appearances. The following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first class cricket in 1885. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season 16 July 1885 . During 1885 Somerset suffered badly from their lack of a strong bowling attack. Playing six matches, there were a total of 120 wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers took only 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket taker, claiming 25 wickets during his four appearances, at an average of 15.32. His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142 wickets from his 24 matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling average was the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who took only seven wickets. Charles Winter, who took the next highest total of wickets, only managed to claim 15 in his 6 appearances. Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset's play, but the club lacked the strength in depth of other county teams. Herbie Hewett, playing his second season of first class cricket, finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35.28, a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season. Only four Somerset batsman passed 50 runs in an innings Hewett, Octavius Radcliffe, Bill Roe, and Charles Winter and only Radcliffe advanced to reach a century during the season. Somerset's first match of 1885 commenced on 16 July 1885, over two months after Nottinghamshire faced Sussex and Surrey travelled to Hampshire to open the first class county cricket season in England. Somerset began their season at home against Hampshire, and after losing the toss were asked to field. Somerset's bowlers restricted the visitors to 175 runs in the first innings, during which Bastard took a career best eight wickets in the innings, conceding 54 runs eight for 54 off his 38 four ball overs. In reply, Somerset fell short of equalling their opponents and were bowled out for 153, Radcliffe top scoring with 51 runs. Bastard collected another three wickets in the second innings, granting him one of two career ten wicket hauls, and Winter took four as Somerset bowled Hampshire out for 111, leaving themselves needing 134 to win. None of Somerset's top four batsmen reached 20 runs, but an unbeaten 50 from Hewett, accompanied by 32 from the number seven, Farrant Reed, helped Somerset achieve a five wicket victory. For their next match Somerset travelled to Moreton in Marsh, where they faced Gloucestershire. Bastard did not take part in the match, and it fell to Winter to bowl the majority of the overs in his absence. Along with his fellow opener, James Parfitt, Winter claimed three wickets, but both openers conceded over 100 runs for their wickets. Sainsbury tried eight different bowlers in an effort to take wickets, and Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 448 after 190 overs. In reply, Somerset conceded their first three wickets for 18 runs, before a brief revival took them to 61 for 3. The last seven wickets then fell for the addition of 39 more runs, and Somerset closed on 100, still trailing their opponents by overs 300 runs. Captain Edward Sainsbury top scored for Somerset, reaching his highest total of the season, 40, and only two other batsmen reached double figures for the county Parfitt and the professional, Albert Clapp. Five Somerset players fell for ducks. Asked by Gloucestershire to follow on, Somerset batted even more poorly in their second effort, in which Winter's total of 21 was the highest score. A total of 80 meant that they lost the match by an innings and 268 runs, their heaviest defeat in first class cricket at that point. The county had just four days to rest and recover from their loss before facing Surrey at The Oval. Bastard was again unavailable for Somerset, and after losing the toss once more, Somerset spent the whole of the first day in the field. Surrey accumulated 564 runs during that day, and reached 635 before Somerset claimed the tenth wicket to close the innings. At that stage, Maurice Read remained at the crease, having scored 186 not out, his highest score in first class cricket. The Somerset opening bowlers, Winter and Parfitt, had both conceded in excess of 100 runs for the second match in a row. Sainsbury had utilised one less bowler than against Gloucestershire in his search for wickets, and claimed four of the wickets himself, recording a career best four for 74. Hewett, whom he asked to bowl 30 overs, finished with 11 maiden overs. The 30 overs he bowled in the match accounted for over a quarter of all his bowling in first class cricket. In reply to Surrey's total, Somerset were bowled out for 83 in their first innings, in which only John Challen and Crescens Robinson reached double figures, scoring 29 and 12 respectively. Clapp is recorded as absent hurt in both of Somerset's innings. In the second innings, Somerset were much improved, reaching 251, their highest batting total of the season. Radcliffe scored the county's only century of the season, scoring 101, and he shared a partnership of 129 with Hewett for the fourth wicket. Hewett reached his own highest score of the season, totalling 85. Nevertheless Somerset's loss was even heavier than that suffered a week earlier, losing by an innings and 301 runs. As of March 2011, both of these back to back losses remain among the ten heaviest experienced by the county in first class cricket. Somerset had just over a week off before their next match, for which they travelled to the County Ground, Southampton to face Hampshire once more. Possibly due to their losses in the previous two matches, Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture, a situation which Roebuck described as shameful. For the first time that season, Somerset batted first. They scored 117, and a contemporary match report praised the batting of Winter and Radcliffe, who scored 22 and 34 respectively in the first innings. Bastard did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants, taking eight of the ten wickets at a cost of only 59 runs , according to the same report. Despite his efforts, Hampshire exceeded Somerset's total, opening up a 45 run lead from the first innings. Winter top scored for Somerset in their second innings, reaching his highest total in first class cricket, 62, after opening the batting. Scores in the 20s from Radcliffe and Egerton Hall helped take Somerset to 166, but Hampshire reached the total required for victory with a day of the match remaining, winning by eight wickets. Surrey visited the County Ground, Taunton a few days later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their previous fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. Bastard, who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. Bastard, presumably due to the weakness of the rest of the county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling to take two for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again. Somerset were the hosts once more for their final match of the season, played with just a single day off after the Surrey match, and that only because the scheduled three day match was concluded in two days. The home side won the toss and elected to bat first against Gloucestershire, who opened the bowling with W. G. Grace and William Woof. The pair bowled unchanged for 30 overs each, and claimed five wickets apiece as Somerset were dismissed for 105. Only Frederick Smith and Challen reached double figures, scoring 37 and 39. In response, Gloucestershire totalled 242, during which Bastard claimed four wickets, three of them from the tail. Somerset batted admirably in their second innings, with Roe and Hewett both scoring half centuries 76 and 66 respectively , and they reached 246, six of the wickets falling to Woof, who collected eleven in the match. Gloucestershire achieved victory for the loss of just one wicket in their second innings, subjecting Somerset to their fifth successive loss. Somerset were stripped of their first class status for three reasons they had not organised and played enough first class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. Somerset played second class cricket for five seasons, finishing as second class county champions in 1890, after which they were readmitted to the first class game.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club%20in%201885
"Somerton smrtn SUM r tn is a town and civil parish in the English county of Somerset. It gave its name to the county and was briefly, around the start of the 14th century, the county town, and around 900 was possibly the capital of Wessex. It has held a weekly market since the Middle Ages, and the main square with its market cross is today an attractive location for visitors. Situated on the River Cary, approximately 8.8 miles 14.2 km north west of Yeovil, Somerton has its own town council serving a population of 4,697 as of 2011. Residents are often referred to locally as Somertonians. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Etsome, Hurcot, Catsgore, and Catcombe. The history of Somerton dates back to the Anglo Saxon era, when it was an important political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined, despite being the county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Having lost county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining. In the centre of Somerton the wide market square, with its octagonal roofed market cross, is surrounded by old houses, while close by is the 13th century Church of St Michael and All Angels. Somerton also had links with Muchelney Abbey in the Middle Ages. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986. The earliest reference to the town is in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle, which records that in 733 the King of Wessex, thelheard lost control of Somerton to thelbald, King of Mercia. Somerton was the site of the 949 meeting of the witan, a form of Anglo Saxon parliament. The town returned to West Saxon royal control in the ninth century, and it was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Sumertone . The name may come from Old English for sea lake enclosure , summer town or summer farmstead . The Somerton name was extended to the people in the area it controlled, and this area became known as Somerset, although Somerton soon ceased to be the most important settlement and never grew into a large town. The parish was the largest in the Hundred of Somerton. It was, briefly, the county town of Somerset from the late thirteenth century into the early fourteenth century. A building referred to as Somerset castle is believed to have been built around 1280 as a county gaol, with a visitor in 1579 describing the remaining portion as an old tower embattled about castle like . It was owned by Sir Ralph Cromwell between 1423 and 1433. Details are vague and visible remains have vanished, so its status as a castle and its very existence is in doubt, with one writer, D.J.C. King, feeling that people were confusing it with Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire. The Abbots of Muchelney Abbey held the Rectorship of the parish church of Somerton during the Middle Ages. They built a tithe barn, to house the tithes of crops and produce paid by the parish to the town's Rector. The Abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the English Reformation, and the tithes and the tithe barn passed into the ownership of Bristol Cathedral. In the 20th century the barn was converted into private housing. Glove making was a major industry in the town in the early nineteenth century, along with the production of rope and twine. The Somerton Brewery, owned by a local landowner named Thomas Templeman, was first recorded under the Tithe Apportionment Act of 1841. The brewery became a large producer in Somerset until its final closure around 1935. Before the National Insurance and the Health Service was introduced, Somerton Men's Club acted as a local provident society within the area. Gypsum was extracted by hand at the Hurcott open cast mine from the Victorian era up until it closed down in 1953. In 1906, a railway station opened on the Castle Cary Cut Off which was built by the Great Western Railway. Whilst the line still remains in use, the station was closed in 1962. When the Marconi Company built the radio stations known as the Imperial Wireless Chain for the Post Office during 192526, they also established their own transmitting station at Dorchester with a receiving station 30 miles 48 km away at Somerton. Somerton was hit by four Luftwaffe bombs on the morning of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The bombs were aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A memorial at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for possible use as the site of a new town hall. The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept local rate to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters including trees and listed buildings and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. In October 2009, eleven of the local councillors resigned en masse, citing excessive criticism from local residents and in particular criticism from a hostile local weblog. In February 2012 the External Auditor appointed by the Audit Commission published a critical Report in the Public Interest regarding the activities of Somerton Town Council in the fiscal year 2008 to 2009. The town falls within the non metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Langport Rural District. The district council is responsible for planning permission and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for major services such as the Local Education Authority, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. Somerton is in the electoral ward of Wessex and whilst it is by far the most populous area, the ward stretches north to Compton Dundon. The total population of the ward taken from the 2011 census was 5,402. Somerton elects one Member of Parliament MP for Somerton and Frome county constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and is part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party list proportional representation. Somerton is situated on a plateau, above and to the south of the deep valley of the River Cary. The river flows west and then north through the Somerton Moor and then into King's Sedgemoor Drain on the Somerset Levels eventually joining the River Parrett near Bridgwater. The town is 116 miles 187 km from London, 28 miles 45 km south from Bristol and 9 miles 14 km north west from Yeovil, just off the Dorset border. Somerton's hamlets include Etsome, Hurcot, Lower Somerton, Littleton and Midney. Great Breach Wood is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI and is situated just 1.4 miles 2.3 km north east from Somerton, near the hamlet of Littleton. Somerton's climate is typical of the climate of south west England which is usually cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more rain experienced in winter. The Somerton parish had a population of 4,706 as of 2002. In the 1801 census the population of the town was 1,145 and the first half of the 19th century saw strong growth reflecting that seen elsewhere in England during this period , with the population rising to 2,140 in 1851. It however then began to drop, starting with a significant drop to 1,917 by the 1861 census. The population steadily fell until 1921, before steadily rising thereafter. It was not until 1961 that the population of Somerton had risen above its former population of 1851. The population has since continued to steadily increase. A weekly market has been held in Somerton for much of its history. The cloth industry dominated the town's market from the 17th century until the 20th century, when agriculture took over as the leading industry. Some light industries and services, such as garage repair, physiotherapy, water treatment, and builders and decorators, are located in the business park on Bancombe Road. The main square, Market Place, with its market cross is today an attractive location for visitors. Market crosses have stood in the square since before 1390 the present Butter Cross, a roofed market cross, was rebuilt in 1673, and is Somerton's most noted feature. The structure was the property of the Earls of Ilchester who sold it to the town in 1916. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Next to the Butter Cross stands the Market Hall , previously known as the Town Hall , although the building has never fulfilled either of these functions. Bordering the square are the church, and the Lady Smith Memorial Hall, also known as the Parish Rooms , which was built in 1902, and the 17th century Market House, now a restaurant. The Red Lion was opened by the Earl of Ilchester in 1768 as a model coaching inn. It closed in 1995 after a period of neglect it has been redeveloped as town houses. From the early 1980s onwards projects aiming to improve Somerton for film industry purposes have been undertaken. The market square was heavily revamped, creating a central parking area with easy access to the local amenities. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986. Somerton Court, originally known as Somerton Erleigh . The house has had various owners including Edward IV's brother, the Duke of Clarence, and Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, who sold the estate in 1530. It passed through a number of hands until 1597 when it was purchased by James Fisher, whose son later rebuilt it in 1641. The court remained in the Fisher family's possession until 1808 when it was sold. Its new owner renamed the house Somerton Court , and replaced the gabled dormers with Gothic battlements and turrets. The house was later enlarged by the Hall Stephenson family. During World War II it was occupied by Royal Navy WRENS. In the 1970s it was purchased by a local businessman Stuart Pattemore. In 1987 Somerton Court and the estate of 55 acres and 4 cottages including The Dower House was purchased by Roger Byron Collins when it subject to extensive upgrading and extensions. It was resold in 2005. The Dower House was built in the early 19th century. Somerton Court is now used for Wedding Receptions. The house now stands in 55 acres grounds. The town's former, and only, railway station was on the Castle Cary Cut Off, once part of the Great Western Railway. Although the line still remains in use the station closed to passengers in 1962, and goods in 1964. The nearest station is now at Castle Cary. On the outskirts of the town stands the impressive Somerton Viaduct. Despite Somerton being situated in a rural area, the closest main road from Somerton is the A303 road that runs near the town and stretches all the way into northern Hampshire and finally ends at Basingstoke. The minor B3165 road runs through the town although the road is less commonly used and does not join to the A303 for another 4 miles 6 km . Two B roads, the B3153 and B3165, run through Somerton the B3165, mentioned earlier, starts in the town and runs southwards to the A372 Langport road. The A372 itself runs south east to the junction of the A303 and A37 roads at Podimore services. The Anglican Church, St Michael's and All Angels, has origins which date from the 13th century, with a major reshaping in the mid 15th century, and further restoration in 1889. It is built of local lias stone cut and squared, with Hamstone dressing. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. It is notable for a carved roof, with lions and a small cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also inspired by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside is one of the finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each carved with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon like beasts. It is said there are bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups. Somerton Infants School and Monteclefe CEVA Junior school merged in September 2014 to form King Ina Academy, with Somerton Roundabout Preschool also amalgating with the school, with the ultimate aim of having one building for the whole academy. Currently the institution is still based on two sites, however applications have been submitted to the Department of Education to be granted permission to build a new, one building free school for King Ina Academy on one of three possible sites, all of which are situated in the western outskirts of the town.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerton%2C%20Somerset
"Brehon Burke Somervell 9 May 1892 13 February 1955 was a general in the United States Army and Commanding General of the Army Service Forces in World War II. As such he was responsible for the U.S. Army's logistics. Following his death, The Washington Post lauded him as one of the ablest officers the United States Army has produced . Somervell graduated near the top of his United States Military Academy class of 1914 and was commissioned in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. During World War I he served with the Pancho Villa Expedition in Mexico and the American Expeditionary Force in France in logistical posts. He was also decorated for gallantry in the Meuse Argonne Offensive. After the war he served in various engineering assignments. From 1936 to 1940 Somervell was head of the Works Project Administration in New York City, where he was responsible for a series of Great Depression relief works, including the construction of LaGuardia Airport. As head of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps in 1941, Somervell took charge of the construction of a series of camps to house the large numbers of draftees who entering into the Army. Once again, Somervell was able to deliver vital projects on time. The most enduring of these projects was the Pentagon, which is today one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. From 1942 to 1945, Somervell commanded the Army Service Forces, the logistical arm of the United States Army. Brehon Burke Somervell was born on 9 May 1892 in Little Rock, Arkansas, the only child of William Taylor Somervell, a physician, and wife Mary nee Burke, a schoolteacher. The two of them opened Belcourt Seminary, a girls' finishing school in Washington, D.C., in 1906. Somervell was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York by Congressman Charles C. Reid of Arkansas. He entered West Point in 1910 and graduated sixth out of the 106 cadets in the class of 1914. Like other high ranking cadets of the period, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. Somervell traveled to Europe for his two months' graduation leave and was in Paris when World War I broke out. Reporting to the U.S. Embassy in Paris for volunteer duty, he became an assistant to the military attache. He took charge of refugee funds and dispensed 1,000,000 to help American citizens to get back home. On return to the United States, he was posted to an engineer battalion at Washington Barracks, DC. Scoring high marks in his Garrison Officers' School examinations, he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant on 28 February 1915. During the Punitive Expedition into Mexico in 1916, he was for a time depot manager at Columbus, New Mexico, the main logistical base of the expedition. Later, he joined the expedition in Mexico, working on roads and as a supply officer. Somervell returned to Washington Barracks to attend the Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun sur Yevre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is sur Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by working his men around the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. He was promoted to major on 15 August 1917 and lieutenant colonel on 1 October 1918. While visiting some friends at the 89th Division, he volunteered his services to its chief of staff, Colonel John C. H. Lee, who accepted him as a temporary replacement for his Assistant Chief of Staff, G 3, in charge of operations, who had been captured a few days before. For leading a three man patrol to inspect damage to a bridge some 600 yards 550 m in front of American lines, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He was one of only nine American officers, including Douglas MacArthur, Barnwell R. Legge, Sereno E. Brett or William J. Donovan, to have been awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal in the First World War. A few days later Lee arranged for Somervell to be permanently assigned to the 89th Division as the G 4 Supply Officer. This relationship would become a critical factor in the service of both men in WWII. Brehon Somervell The 89th Division returned to the United States in May 1919 but Somervell remained behind as Assistant Chief of Staff, G 4, in charge of supply, of the U.S. Third Army, and the American Forces in Germany, as it was re designated on 2 July 1919. There, he met Anna Purnell, the daughter of a Chicago businessman, who was there as a YMCA volunteer. The two were married in August 1919. They had three children together, all daughters. While in Germany, Somervell also met Walker D. Hines, a prominent New York corporate lawyer, whom he assisted with a survey of shipping and navigation on the Rhine River. Somervell reverted to the permanent rank of major on 1 July 1920. Returning to the United States in July 1920, Somervell was posted to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C. His war record earned him a place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, reserved for the Army's best and most promising officers. He once again ranked near the top of his class. After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist Hines with a special study of navigation on the Rhine and Danube Rivers on behalf of the League of Nations, essentially a continuation of the work that the two men had done in 1920. He then attended the Army War College from 1925 to 1926. From 1926 to 1930 he was District Engineer, Washington, D.C. Engineer District. As such he became involved in a conflict between proponents of the development of hydroelectric power through damming the Great Falls of the Potomac River and the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission. Despite his advocacy, the falls remain undammed to this day. On 1 September 1930, Somervell was transferred to the Lower Mississippi Valley Division as Assistant Chief Engineer. The next year he became assistant to, and then the District Engineer of the Memphis District. In 1933, he teamed up with Hines again, for an economic survey of Turkey, which culminated in a seven volume report. Named as District Engineer for Ocala, Florida, Somervell got behind a project to build the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Somervell was chosen to head the project but although President Franklin D. Roosevelt allocated emergency funds for the canal in 1935, opponents of the canal protested that it would cause seawater to seep into the groundwater, and work was stopped a year later. In the meantime, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 August 1935. In 1935, Somervell was appointed as head of the Works Project Administration in New York City. Over the next three and a half years he spent 10,000,000 a month on Great Depression relief works. The biggest project was the construction of what became LaGuardia Airport. Somervell established a reputation as a man who could handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars. Early in his administration he worked to repair relations with labor unions and left wing groups that had suffered under his strongly anti Communist predecessor Victor F. Ridder. He stated he had no objection to picketing of WPA headquarters. He also downplayed talk of a Red menace in the New York WPA, once declaring that I wouldn't know a Red if I saw one, and wouldn't do anything about it if I did. Relations with labor deteriorated, however, especially after WPA funding cuts and policy changes made by Congress in 1939 led to the dismissal of more than half of the citys WPA workforce. Somervells relations with WPAs arts program were particularly difficult. When Congress in 1940 required all WPA workers to sign a loyalty oath an increasingly anti Communist Somervell ordered a deeper investigation of even those arts project workers who had signed the oath. He also began a program of censoring the content of WPA financed murals and other art, giving instructions to guard against anything in which the main idea is social content, rather than artistic value, and eliminate anything that may savor of propaganda, and to see that the project devotes itself to art and not politics. In his most controversial decision, in July 1940 he ordered the burning of three out of four murals on the history of aviation at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn because of the inclusion of supposed Communist symbols. In December 1940, Somervell became head of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps, and was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general on 29 January 1941. His immediate concern was the construction of a series of camps which were scheduled for completion by April 1941to house the large numbers of draftees who were then entering the Army. Reasoning that time was more important than money, Somervell pushed the project through to completion. By February, he was responsible for a work force 485,000 people employed on military construction projects. The job was completed on time but over 100 million over budget. He was also responsible for constructing new facilities to hold stores and munitions, for which 700 million was allocated by December 1940. By December 1941, 375 projects had been completed and 320 were still under way, with a total value of 1.8 billion. He accepted promotion to brigadier general in the Army of the United States on February 14, 1941 with the date of rank of January 29, 1941. The best known of these projects was the Pentagon, an enormous office complex to house the War Department's 40,000 person staff together in one building. On the afternoon of Thursday, 17 July 1941, Somervell summoned George Bergstrom and Major Hugh Casey. Bergstrom was a former president of the American Institute of Architects Casey a Corps of Engineers officer seconded to the Construction Division. The two had previously worked together closely on the design of cantonments. Somervell gave them until 9am on Monday morning to design the building, which he envisaged as a modern, four story structure with no elevators on the site of the old Washington Hoover Airport. Over that very busy weekend , Casey, Bergstrom and their staff roughed out the design for a four story, five sided structure with a floor area of 5,100,000 square feet 470,000 m2 twice that of the Empire State Building. The estimated cost was 35 million. President Roosevelt subsequently moved the site of the building, over Somervell's objections, in order to prevent it being constructed in front of Arlington National Cemetery. Somervell still pursued his own designs, making important changes, including the addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were working around the clock on the building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of 63 million, the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and the addition of the extra floor. For his work with the Construction Division, Somervell was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal. Somervell hoped to become Chief of Engineers but was not really in the running , being too junior in rank. Instead, the job went to Brigadier General Eugene Reybold, the Assistant Chief of Staff, G 4 on the War Department General Staff. Somervell's post was abolished on the transfer of the Construction Division to the Corps of Engineers. Reybold, who considered Somervell a firecracker but ruthless who didn't care who he hit , selected Brigadier General Thomas M. Robins to head the new Corps of Engineers Construction Division. Somervell instead received Reybold's former assignment, with promotion to the temporary rank of major general on January 28, 1942 and was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on March 9, 1942. The posting was unusual because Somervell had never previously served on War Department General Staff. As Assistant Chief of Staff, G 4, Somervell pressed for the adoption of a comprehensive Army Supply Program that would set targets and priorities for all Army production. Such a program could be used as the basis for requests for appropriations, for expenditures, and for allocating scare materials. Within weeks the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, implemented sweeping changes to the War Department designed to reduce the number of people reporting to him so as to free his time for planning and conducting a global war. Three huge new commands were created by Executive Order Number 9082 of 28 February 1942, Reorganizing the Army and the War Department the Army Air Forces under Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the Army Ground Forces under Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair and the Services of Supply, under Somervell. As such, he was not only promoted to the rank of lieutenant general over the heads of many more senior officers, but some of them, including Reybold, now found themselves his subordinates. He was answerable to two men Marshall, and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Somervell built up a good working relationship with both. Senator Harry S. Truman of the Truman Committee disapproved of Somervell's cost overruns, declaring I will say this for General Somervell, he will get the stuff, but it is going to be hell on the taxpayer. He has a WPA attitude on the expenditure of money. As Gen. Marshall and the other Joint Chiefs developed the overall plan to prosecute the war in two hemispheres, it became evident that a logistics chief for the ETO had to be selected. In May 1942 Somervell chose his WWI 89th Division superior, Maj. Gen. John C. H. Lee, who was commanding the 2nd Infantry Division United States in Texas at the time, to take this post. The Services of Supply was renamed the Army Service Forces in March 1943, as the term supply was felt to be too narrow a description of the broad range of logistic activities carried out by the organization. As head of Army Service Forces, Somervell became responsible for the implementation of the Army Supply Program. Somervell was on the cover of the June 15, 1942 issue of Time and also of Life in an article written by Charles J.V. Murphy titled Somervell of the S.O.S , in the 8 May 1943 issue. According to military historian John D. Millett, who served on Somervell's Army Service Forces staff, Somervell was impatient, tense, and decisive . Some saw him as an empire builder . Millett noted the opinion of an observer that In the jurisdictional. wrangles that developed there was one argument ad hominem that was constantly used, to wit that the A.S.F. and its dynamic Commanding General were constantly seeking as Empire Builders' to enlarge their job by encroaching on that of others. By dint of repetition it got considerable acceptance inside the Department and out. There was something in the drive of the Commanding General of the A.S.F., his quickness on the mental trigger, his adroitness and his evident ambition to tackle tough jobs that in itself lent some support to this feeling of impending encroachment among those of a more deliberate pace. I should be surprised if the Chief of Staff ever had any such feeling though he must have been well aware of the feelings of others in his organization in this respect. A 1943 attempt by Somervell to abolish the Technical Services failed amid the furor and panic created by false rumors that he was being considered for the post of chief of staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. Somervell sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects, such as the Canol Road, which he continued long after the strategic imperative behind it had faded. Somervell understood logistics and its paramount importance in modern warfare, and he spared no effort to ensure that the American fighting man had all he needed for victory. Near the end of the war, Somervell was promoted to general on March 9, 1945. He was the very few officers to be promoted to that rank during the war who had not commanded combat forces overseas. When Somervell's retirement was announced in December 1945, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson issued a press release that read In organizing and directing the worldwide supply lines on which our troops depended for their offensive power, General Somervell performed a service without parallel in military history. He was completely dedicated to the task of winning the war in the shortest possible time and with the smallest cost in America lives, and the energy and ability he applied to his task contributed in great measure to the force of our attack and the speed of our victory. Somervell retired from the Army on 30 April 1946 and moved to Ocala, Florida. His wife Anna had died in January 1942, and he had married Mrs. Louise Hampton Wartmann, a former student at Belcourt, in March 1943. Somervell accepted an offer to become president of Koppers, a Pittsburgh based company that mined coal and manufactured and sold coal based products. Applying the same managerial techniques that he had employed in the Army, he thoroughly reorganized the company, and doubled revenues and tripled profits over the next five years. Somervell suffered a series of health problems in the 1950s. He had an appendectomy in 1953 and a hernia operation in 1954. He suffered a severe heart attack in September 1954 and returned to his home Ocala to recuperate. In early 1955 he decided to resign as president and withdraw from day to day operations. He had a second, fatal heart attack at his home on 13 February 1955. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, not far from his brain child , the Pentagon. Unfortunately, his other great creation, the Army Service Forces, did not survive, being abolished in May 1946. The Washington Post lauded him as one of the ablest officers the United States Army has produced . The USAT General Brehon B. Somervell, a US Army Reserve logistics support vessel that can carry up to 2,000 short tons 1,800 t of cargo, is named in his honor. Here is the ribbon bar of General Brehon B.

"Something Anything is the third album by American musician Todd Rundgren, released in February 1972. It was his first double album, and was recorded in late 1971 in Los Angeles, New York City and Bearsville Studios, Woodstock. Three quarters of the album was recorded in the studio with Rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals, as well as being the producer. The final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short snippet of archive recordings from the 1960s. Rundgren had become confident enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards that he had tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles in an attempt to record an entire album single handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album. The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold three years after its release. A single taken from the album, Hello It's Me , was a top five hit in the US in late 1972, and it contained a further hit, I Saw the Light . Something Anything later attracted critical acclaim as one of the most significant records of the 1970s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 173 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. After Something Anything, Rundgren moved away from the straightforward pop ballads present on this album to more experimental territory and progressive rock in later releases, beginning with the following A Wizard, A True Star 1973 . By the time Rundgren started recording the album, he had already achieved commercial success as a solo artist and producer, and this increased his self confidence. He had also become dissatisfied with other musicians playing on his recordings, recalling, I'd never played drums or bass before, though I would hector those that did. This led him to decide to record the entire album by himself using multi tracking. He wrote the material for the album at a prolific rate. He attributed his productivity to Ritalin 18 and cannabis, stating that the drugs caused me to crank out songs at an incredible pace. He found some of the other songs quick to write, too, noting they were all basically starting out with C Major 7th, and I'd start moving my hand around in predictable patterns until a song came out. The majority of backing tracks on the first three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. 4 The studio was one of the first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it was the logical place to start, 20 with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head to remember where he was, but if I would screw up, then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that I had made, because it was easier than going back and fixing it. 1 24 In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result sound like a band . He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact. 7 35 Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was mostly working in the dark , and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. I was never sure exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks. In addition to recording at I.D. Sound, Rundgren took an 8 track recorder and some studio equipment, installing it at his rented home on Astral Drive, Nichols Canyon. 'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. 7 A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. 7 Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. 20 The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment. Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and wouldn't have had it any other way. 16 10 Rundgren contemplated recording more tracks to make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session at the Record Plant with session players. 14 50 The basic idea was to create songs with sing along choruses. Rundgren did not pre plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material. 11 Rundgren contacted Moogy Klingman, who would appear on several tracks and later co found Utopia with Rundgren. 11 Rundgren instructed Klingman to find the best session players possible for the recording. Klingman recalled getting a phone call from Rundgren late on a Friday evening asking him to find a full band by Sunday morning He wanted horns, singers, everything, so I made a ton of phone calls. Klingman said that not everyone could make the entire session, so a variety of musicians, particularly guitarists and bassists, needed to be used. 21 The performers, including Rundgren himself, only rehearsed the songs a few times before committing the performance to tape, in order to sound spontaneous, and some of the banter between takes appears on the finished album. 11 Three songs were recorded at the Record Plant, including one of Klingman's own, Dust in the Wind . Guitarist Rick Derringer appeared on one track, and would collaborate with Rundgren in the future. Trumpeter Randy Brecker had been a founding member of Blood, Sweat Tears and, along with his brother Michael, who also played on the Record Plant sessions, went on to find commercial success with the Brecker Brothers. Trombonist Barry Rogers, who completed the brass section on the Record Plant recordings, had also collaborated with the Brecker brothers in the band Dreams. A further live session was held at Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, 4 which used some of the members of the Paul Butterfield blues band, 22 resulting in two other tracks. The final track on side four, Slut , was recorded earlier at a live session in I.D. Sound Studios, and featured previous collaborators Tony and Hunt Sales, and guitarist Rick Vito. 15 The majority of vocals for the existing studio tracks were also recorded at the Record Plant, with additional recording at Bearsville, where the album was mixed. 4 As in LA, Lowe helped out with the engineering. We'd just put up a Neumann U67 and he'd sing right there in the control room using the monitors for the playback. The liner notes describe the first side of the album as a bouquet of ear catching melodies , the second as the cerebral side , the third as The kid gets heavy , and the fourth is titled Baby Needs a New Pair of Snakeskin Boots A Pop Operetta . Rundgren wrote the sleeve notes, and included a small operetta that described a narrative between live tracks. I Saw the Light was placed at the start of album, as it was felt to be the most likely hit. The song was influenced by Carole King and written in approximately 20 minutes. Couldn't I Just Tell You has had a major influence on artists in the power pop music genre, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the All Music Guide calling it one of the great songs that provided power pop with its foundation . Scott Miller's 2010 book Music What Happened calls the song likely the greatest power pop recording ever made, with lyrics somehow both desperate and lighthearted at the same time, and a guitar solo having truly amazing dexterity and inflection. Hello It's Me had been recorded by Rundgren's old band, Nazz. As with the rest of the live tracks on side four, little preparation was done for the track. Rundgren later claimed the entire song was rehearsed and recorded in under two hours, 13 57 and the horn lines and backing vocals at the end of the track were completely improvised. 19 The fourth side was completed by two small extracts of archive recordings featuring Rundgren in the 1960s. The first was a performance of Barrett Strong's Money That's What I Want by a group of the same name 'Money', recorded around 1966, while the second was a clip of Messin' with the Kid performed by Woody's Truck Stop in Philadelphia, late 1966. 11 Something Anything was released in February 1972. White labeled promotional DJ issues of the LP were pressed on colored vinyl the first record on red vinyl, the second on blue. Billboard reviewed that Rundgren's songs have an aura of being irreverent, irrelevant little ditties, while in reality they are penetratingly strident observations , and that he seemed to have had fun making the album. Hello It's Me was released as a single late in 1972, and reached 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 the following year. According to Encyclopedia of Popular Music writer Colin Larkin, the album has since been rightly regarded as one of the landmark releases of the early 70s . AllMusic especially praised the album's endearing tone and often adventurous variety of styles, commenting that Listening to Something Anything is a mind altering trip in itself, no matter how many instantly memorable, shamelessly accessible pop songs are scattered throughout the album. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau also applauded the albums variety The many good songs span styles and subjects in a virtuoso display ... And the many ordinary ones are saved by Todd's confidence and verve. Rolling Stone found the songs perfectly composed while deeming the record Rundgren's best selling, most enduring work born of desperation , one that demonstrates his command of the studio, unfurling his falsetto over a kaleidoscope of rock genres . Axl Rose declared in a 1989 Rolling Stone interview that Today, my favorite record is Todd Rundgren's Something Anything . Rundgren himself has been more ambivalent about the album's success and critical acclaim. He has stated several times that since he had already become successful as a producer, he was not as interested in straight commercial pop success as other artists. In particular, he rejected a tag of being a male Carole King . With all due respect, he later stated, I took no comfort in merely being labeled a 'singer songwriter'. 22 Subsequent albums, beginning with the follow up A Wizard, A True Star and the spin off group Utopia, would see a radical shift away from straightforward three minute pop. All tracks are written by Todd Rundgren except where noted. Todd Rundgren performs all instruments and vocals, except for the following tracks on side four Album Single",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something/Anything%3F
"Something Borrowed is the ninth episode of the second series of the British science fiction television series Torchwood. It was first broadcast on BBC Three on 5 March 2008 and repeated on BBC Two one week later. The episode was written by Phil Ford, directed by Ashley Way and produced by Richard Stokes. The episode featured the five initial series regulars John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Burn Gorman, Naoko Mori and Gareth David Lloyd plus recurring actor Kai Owen in a central role. The episode centres on the marriage of the alien hunter Gwen Cooper Eve Myles to the transport manager Rhys Williams Kai Owen . The wedding is complicated by Gwen's sudden impregnation by an alien, though she resolves to see the day through. When the nuptials are interrupted by an attack from the biological mother of the alien fetus played successively by Collette Brown, Nerys Hughes and John Barrowman , Rhys, Gwen, and Gwen's teammates at Torchwood must neutralise the threat. Gwen and Rhys ultimately marry, and the wedding guests have their memories wiped. The episode was designed to be the most humorous of Torchwood's second series and incorporated elements of broad comedy and soap opera style storytelling to the monster of the week story. It was filmed largely on location in South Walesprominent locations included the tourist attractions Margam Country Park and Dyffryn Gardensand featured an ensemble of previously unseen Welsh characters. The episode was seen by an aggregated total of 4.76 million viewers across its three debut showings in the United Kingdom. Critical response was extremely mixed, with some reviewers praising the inclusion of a less serious episode and others expressing the view that the comedy was too overt. On the night before her wedding, Gwen Cooper Eve Myles is bitten on the arm by a male shape shifting alien. Her boss, Jack Harkness John Barrowman kills the alien, and Gwen attends her hen night though is troubled by her wound. She wakes up the next morning heavily pregnant. Jack arrives along with Torchwood's medic Owen Harper Burn Gorman to examine Gwen and tries to persuade her to cancel her wedding. Gwen's fiancee Rhys Kai Owen also tries to postpone the wedding in Gwen's interest but Gwen insists that the wedding go ahead as she desires nothing more than to marry him. The sudden pregnancy is explained to Gwen and Rhys' families as their own child. Gwen's mother Sharon Morgan and father William Thomas are excited at the prospect of a grandchild, but Rhys' parents suspect Gwen of being pregnant by another man. Torchwood agent Toshiko Sato Naoko Mori is sent to the wedding venue to keep an eye on Gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy. At Torchwood's Cardiff headquarters, Owen determines from an autopsy that the alien that impregnated Gwen is a Nostrovite, a race of carnivorous shape shifters who hunt in pairs and mate for life. He tells Jack that after fertilisation, the female transfers her eggs to the male who plants them in a host body until they are ready to hatch. Later, the female kills the host to release the offspring. At the wedding venue, the female Nostrovite Colette Brown murders and partly devours wedding guest Mervyn. Toshiko investigates along with Rhys' best man Banana Boat Jonathan Lewis Owen and they are subsequently captured by the alien, who intends to feed on them later. As Gwen and Rhys prepare to say their wedding vows, Jack runs up the aisle and demands that the wedding be halted. Owen and Ianto Gareth David Lloyd free Toshiko but the half eaten corpse of Mervyn is discovered by his wife, a bridesmaid, who alerts the entire wedding party to the murder. The Nostrovite reveals herself and is chased away by Jack, escaping through a window. Jack questions Owen about Gwen and Rhys, and he states that Rhys' mother Brenda Nerys Hughes is with them. Tosh mentions that she saw Brenda with Gwen's mother Mary in the garden. Tosh and Jack rush to the couple's room, where Jack identifies Brenda as an alien and calls her an ugly bitch . After Brenda protests her innocence and Rhys punches Jack, Gwen states that Rhys' mother is not the shapeshifter as Brenda wears a distinctive perfume. Torchwood reach the garden to find the Nostrovite, in Brenda's image, with Mary. The alien holds Mary hostage, demanding that Gwen give her her child. Gwen walks towards them and as the Nostrovite releases Mary, Gwen reveals a hidden gun in her wedding bouquet and fires at the creature. Owen suggests using a piece of alien equipment called the singularity scalpel to destroy the alien fetus. He sends Gwen to her room and teaches Rhys how to use the scalpel Owen cannot use it himself due to injuries sustained in his undead state. Gwen is approached by Jack and reveals to him that she would have married Rhys a long time ago if she had not met him. She leans in as he appears to be ready to kiss her but he reveals himself to be the Nostrovite. Owen enters, shooting the creature whilst Gwen exits with Rhys. The Nostrovite, still in Jack's form, attempts to attack Owen only to be repelled by the fact he is dead. Rhys and Gwen find refuge in a barn and Rhys explains Owen's plan to remove the fetus. As the Nostrovite launches an assault on the door of the barn, Rhys succeeds in destroying the fetus. The Nostrovite enters, again impersonating Rhys' mother. She attacks Rhys, who attempts to protect himself with a chainsaw, which malfunctions. Jack arrives and kills the alien with a more powerful gun. He shares a moment of joy with Gwen before praising Rhys' own display of heroism and telling him that the hero always gets the girl . Rhys and Gwen return to the wedding venue and are married. At the wedding reception, they notice the guests all suddenly falling asleep. Jack reveals that he has drugged them all with amnesia pills mixed with sedative so that they will not remember the events of the day. Jack offers Gwen and Rhys Retcon too but Gwen declines as she does not wants any secrets in her marriage to Rhys. As Gwen and Rhys anticipate their honeymoon, Torchwood clear up the mess left behind. Later, Jack enters the Hub alone, and retrieves an old tin box from his office. He looks through photographs from his past, reminiscing, before picking up a picture of himself and an unidentified bride at their wedding. The original working title and given descriptor in the series breakdown for Something Borrowed was The Wedding . Writer Phil Ford felt the episode to be reminiscent of a soap opera as well as possessing science fiction elements. He describes the episode as Coronation Street meets Torchwood . Ford was chosen to write this episode because of his own involvement as a writer on Coronation Street and executive producer Russell T Davies' view that this would enable him to handle a wedding with comedic elements. As the most humorous episode of the series it was deliberately scheduled alongside a series of darker episodes to provide a contrast. Describing the tone of the episode Ford describes it as an all out romp and an action, rollercoaster ride with a lot of comedy in it as much as thrills and nasty monsters . Davies stated that the whole point of the episode is to have a right old laugh . Expanding on the comedic aspects, something Ford considered whilst writing the episode was that the trick is to have the comedy come out of the characters rather than the scenario itself. It was Eve Myles' idea to have Gwen compulsively eat gherkins after waking up pregnant the script had only specified the character drinking a glass of water. The episode also plays on Gwen's conflicted feelings between Jack and Rhys. Davies felt it would be irresistible to have the wedding temporarily halted by the one man Rhys doesn't want to see running down the aisle. Ford stated that whilst Jack is the series hero Rhys is the hero of this episode . He compares a sequence where Rhys arms himself with a chainsaw to defend Gwen to the character being in Evil Dead mode . Producer Richard Stokes commented that the episode illuminated that even though 's put through some really difficult times, she really does love him and want to be with him. In an early draft of the script Gwen and Rhys had their memories wiped at the end of the episode in addition to the other guests and were convinced by Jack that the wedding had been problem free. The episode featured an ensemble of family and friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series. William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper. Davies re introduced the characters during the fourth series of the show, considering Thomas and Morgan to be two fine Welsh actors . Thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks and the 2005 Doctor Who episode Boom Town . Upon appearing in Something Borrowed he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series, new series and Torchwood. Nerys Hughes played Rhys' mother Brenda Williams, in addition to a duplicate form of the alien Nostrovite. Like Thomas she had previously appeared in a Doctor Who serial the 1982 story Kinda . Hughes enjoyed getting to play a monster for the first time in her career which involved having fangs and claws and red eyes and being wired up so all this black blood can ooze out when I get shot . Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that everyone plays it for real and that you can't camp it up . She believed that as an actor you've got to believe what you're doing . Kai Owen describes Thomas, Morgan and Hughes collectively with Robin Griffith Barry Williams as a good old fashioned Welsh cast who know what it's all about . Jonathan Lewis Owen was cast as Rhys' best man Banana Boat a character referred to sporadically since Torchwood's first series premiere Everything Changes 2006 . In keeping with the character's name he was given a pair of banana patterned cuff links to compliment his costume. As a joke, Eve Myles who Jonathan Owen had previously worked with in other projects left a banana skin on his car on his first day of filming. Collette Brown played Carrie , the original human form of the mother Nostrovite. To transform her into the alien creature the actress was required to spend approximately an hour having make up applied. Brown was surprised at the efficiency of the make up artists as she had expected the transformation process to take longer. Originally, the human versions of the Nostrovite shapeshifter were intended to be more monstrous but Davies felt it was important that the audience would still be able to recognise the actor underneath once the make up had been applied. The episode was filmed between October and November 2007 in the sixth production block of the series, alongside Exit Wounds . The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations were used for the wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that it felt like we were organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues . Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team had to make sure that the colour scheme co ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded as if I was the biggest sinner in the world and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself. The main location shoot for the episode was at Margam Country Park in Margam, Port Talbot in and around a converted Orangery which provided a location for the wedding and reception. Way states that one of the reasons Margam's Orangery was chosen for the shoot was because of the fantastic windows which provided a good visual opportunity in regards to a sequence involving the alien Carrie jumping out of them. However, due to its listed building status the production crew were not able to remove the window glass for filming and had to construct replica windows on separate scaffolding using resin glass. The hotel exteriors and sequences set in the gardens of the wedding venue were filmed at Dyffryn Gardens in St Nicholas, Vale of Glamorgan. The hotel interiors were partly recorded at Court Colman Manor in the village of Pen y fai, Bridgend, and partly in studio. The opening sequence of the episode where Gwen pursues the shape shifter was recorded on 19 November in a men's public toilet in The Hayes, a shopping area in central Cardiff. The episode featured a large amount of incidental music. During Gwen's hen night, the club she is in plays the tracks Filthy Gorgeous and Comfortably Numb by the Scissor Sisters from their eponymous 2004 album and the single Hole in the Head from the Sugababes 2003 album Three. The song heard on Gwen's radio Alarm Clock when she wakes up heavily pregnant is Fire in My Heart from the Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals. At Gwen and Rhys' wedding reception, the records played include You Do Something to Me by Paul Weller and the song Tainted Love by Soft Cell. One of the black and white photos of Jack seen at the end of the episode is actually a promotional picture of John Barrowman from his role as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago. Something Borrowed was first broadcast on the digital channel BBC Three on 5 March 2008 at 9 50 pm, straight after the BBC Two broadcast of the preceding episode A Day in the Death at 9 00 pm. The episode was first broadcast on BBC Two on 12 March at 9 00 pm, with a pre watershed repeat airing on 13 March at 7 00 pm. According to consolidated figures the episode was viewed by 0.98 million viewers on BBC Three, 2.76 million viewers for its 12 March BBC Two showing and 1.02 million viewers for the pre watershed repeat amounting to an aggregated 4.76 million viewers across its three initial showings. The episode was also available to watch on the online catch up service BBC iPlayer, where it was the 12th most viewed individual broadcast between 1 January and 31 March 2008. The episode received critical response ranging from extremely positive to extremely negative. Ben Rawson Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five, summarising it as an energetic romp that oozed with body horror that would make David Cronenberg proud which also infused a type of family melodrama commonly seen on soaps . He praised the stunningly bonkers plot noting that every potential dramatic and comedic moment that stemmed from Gwen's unconventional 'bun in the oven' scenario was fully maximised . He felt that in the central role Eve Myles delivered an outstanding performance as Gwen and also singled out the guest actors for praise, particularly Nerys Hughes. In an end of series review he listed Something Borrowed as his favourite episode of Torchwood's second series. Writing for The Stage, Mark Wright wrote that its good to see Torchwood can get in touch with its lighter side and not lose any momentum concluding I think I really might love this show . Jon Beresford of TV Scoop felt the episode to be one of the strongest of the second series. Whilst he felt it to be corny in places he summarised the episode as an exciting yarn with some really good performances from the team . He felt that Myles and Owen stole the show as Gwen and Rhys believing that there's a definite spark between these two that sets their moments apart. Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine felt the episode to be the strongest of the second series. She praised the uniformly fantastic guest cast and the drop dead gorgeous exterior and interior locations. She singled out writer Phil Ford for considerable praise feeling that he wrote the episode true to the characters while filling in backstory we had no way of imagining and delivered drama, action, and laughs . Brad Trechak of AOL TV felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes. He praised the episode for being light and fluffy yet it furthered things along with regard to the Torchwood universe and its characters . Reviewing the episode Brigid Cherry of Total Sci Fi felt that contrary to expectation its hilarious . She praised the comedy provided from Eve Myles, Gareth David Lloyd and Nerys Hughes in particular as well as the terrifying moments that threaten to tip over into gross out horror comedy. She felt overall the offbeat self parody made a welcome change from the show's more serious episodes and rated it eight out of ten. Den of Geek's Jack Kibble White found the episode to be a surprise series highlight . However, the episode attracted heavy criticism. In a review titled Too Much Crying, Not Enough Shagging io9's Charlie Jane Anders criticised the episode's reliance on cheesy soap opera moments . Her major criticisms also encompassed the nonsensical aspects of the plot and the depiction of Torchwood as an incompetent team, particularly in allowing Gwen to progress with her wedding in the circumstance of her being pregnant. She felt that the episode had saving graces in a sequence which she felt acted as an homage to films Dead Alive and Evil Dead and the fact it made her believe that Rhys and Gwen care about each other. Ian Berriman of SFX magazine wrote that the episode was one of the weakest of the second series and was hampered by limp gags and thuddingly obvious characterisation . IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode five out of ten and criticised it as flat out bad television . He felt the comedic style to be at odds with Torchwood's science fiction and horror storytelling and criticised some of the character moments as preposterous and insipid . Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair was more mixed stating that the episode feels like a lot of ideas have been thrown into a pot and mixed with all the Torchwood goodness . He felt that the episode held together by luck more than skill but still provided a lot of laughs and some wild fun . Den of Geek's Andrew Mickel felt that the episode exaggerated and stereotyped the Welsh characters in the overall scenario parodying them collectively as the Welshest people on television . He also criticised the focus on Gwen and the ridiculousness of her plan to marry Rhys despite her being pregnant. He felt however, that the episode played out like a fun episode of Buffy and that Rhys continued to be Gwens one redeeming feature , praising the scenes between him and his mother.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something%20Borrowed%20%28Torchwood%29
"Something New is a song recorded by British girl group Girls Aloud from their second compilation album, Ten 2012 . It was released by Polydor Records on 16 November 2012, as the first single from the album and the official single for Children in Need 2012. In February 2009, the group signed a new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums however, they announced that they were taking a hiatus to pursue solo projects. In April 2012, bandmate Cheryl revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In October 2012, a countdown was activated on Girls Aloud's official website, which would last until 19 October 2012, when Something New would be premiered on radio. However the date was brought forward to 16 October 2012 following an early online leak of the track. Something New is a dance song produced by Girls Aloud's long time collaborator Brian Higgins. Music critics were mostly positive towards the production, and compared it to songs by David Guetta, Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. They also noted that the track's structure follow the group's signature style. Something New debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Girls Aloud's 16th top five hit in the country. The song also peaked inside the top five in Ireland and Scotland. The accompanying music video was directed by Ray Kay, and features a mixture of black and white and coloured shots of the entire group, while also showcasing each member in a separate set up. Girls Aloud performed Something New in few programmes, such as Strictly Come Dancing and Top of the Pops, and in 2013's Ten The Hits Tour. This is the second Children in Need song that the band have released, the first being I'll Stand by You in 2004. In February 2009, Girls Aloud signed a new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums. However, in July 2009, the group announced that they were taking a year long hiatus to pursue solo projects but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010 this did not happen, however. Two months later, the hiatus was briefly interrupted when they did two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay Z at Wembley Stadium. In April 2012, during an interview with Chris Moyles on Radio 1, Cheryl Cole revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In August 2012, Nicola Roberts was also featured on the same radio show, and said, It's our tenth birthday in November so we will definitely celebrating. I wanna tell you everything but I really can't The comeback was confirmed when Girls Aloud's official website posted on 9 October a countdown that would last until 19 October, when the girls would make a special announcement. It was speculated that they would make an appearance on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, where bandmate Kimberley Walsh joined as a contestant. However, on 15 October, the surprise, a single titled Something New , leaked online in full. The official radio premiere of the song was then brought forward to the following day, with Girls Aloud posting on their website, It's here The finished version of Something New will be played on radio from midday and will also be on YouTube to listen in full. Something New was released on 16 November 2012 by Polydor Records through digital download, serving as the official Children in Need 2012 single. When asked about how she felt with the group being back together and the reception from the public, Walsh said, I'm kind of flattered people actually care if we come back or not. I think we are all quite proud that we made enough of an impact to be able to a comeback. Something New was recorded in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Something New opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing Go, girls, g g go, go, go We girls gonna take control You boys better know, know, know We girls gonna run this show over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, after a generic dance beat kicks in, the rest of the track is a mish mash of rap and mixed solos. As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, All I want is something new Something I can hold on to I dont wanna talk I just wanna dance Baby let it drop Catch me if you can. Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound. It ends with the group shouting, Boy you better watch your back Cause we're the leaders of the pack. A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of Sexy No No No... 2007 , and thought that Something New echoed the group's previous single, Something Kinda Ooooh 2006 , not only because of the title, but it also has the same slightly demented feel to it, all distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit. Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's odd structure, which is noted as typical and the group's signature style . According to a Metro publication, Something New had a generally positive reaction from fans. Susana Novo Vasquez of The Huffington Post stated that the indisputable team of Xenomania Girls Aloud have been the ones to set the trends over the years for others to follow, adding that the song continues down that path. Vasquez continued saying that the group returned into a moment where the pop scene ... isn't the same as when they left, but thought that they were doing it in a very intelligent way by adopting some of the Calvin Harris electronic massive sound that is current right now, yet creating an intricate song structure. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that like most Girls Aloud singles, a few listens are required to get our heads around it. Copsey criticized the distorted vocals and the fact that there probably won't be a full album of new tracks to accompany it, but admitted that it sounds modern enough for today's charts without compromising their signature sound and praised its massive chorus. Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media thought that the track is a game approximation of the Girls Aloud of seven years ago, while BBC Music reviewer Ian Wade concluded that, as its title suggests, Something New is just that, a fanfare like call to arms announcing the groups return. Phill Udel of State said that, with the song, Girls Aloud have managed to maintain the quality they had prior to the release of Ten, and commented that the other three new songs are nowhere near up to the same standard. Idolator blogger Sam Lansky commented that, for the fans, Something New is a welcome relief to have an injection of fresh energy into the stagnant girl group scene, and concluded that, given that this may be the group's final single before disbanding for good, they're certainly going out on a high note, with a track that feels quintessentially Aloud but retooled for 2012. Rebecca Twomey of Marie Claire said that the group is on key with the current trend for dance music with their new song, while noting that they have clearly taken inspiration from Cheryl's Call My Name. Katy Brand of The Daily Telegraph was critical towards the song. Brand said that the lyrics are the usual post Spice fare, but commented that the images weren't quite matching the words. I was hearing the battle cry of enraged queens who will be oppressed no longer I was watching five young women wearing identical orange mini dresses, strutting up and down in perfect synchronicity, like catwalk models. In 2013 it was nominated for the Popjustice 20 Music Prize. Something New debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart with sales of 70,000 units, becoming Girls Aloud's 16th top five hit in the country, but being held off the top spot by Olly Murs's Troublemaker 2012 , which sold a total of 121,000 units. The following week, the song fell out of the top ten, reaching number 14. It also debuted at number four in Ireland, falling to number 17 the following week. In Scotland, the song became the group's third consecutive single to peak at number two, falling to 13 the following week. Amidst rumors that Girls Aloud were preparing the release of a new single, Daily Mirror reported that the group reunited for the video shoot on 2 October 2012. On 15 October 2012, they uploaded a teaser video on YouTube, in which we see the five girls wearing matching bright orange tulip skirt dresses as they march away from the camera on a monochrome set. On 19 October 2012, the video was officially released through VEVO. Directed by Ray Kay, the video features a mixture of black and white and colored shots, and also showcases each member in a separate set up based around a triangle enthused backdrop, while being accentuated by a projection of light. These shots are primarily beauty shots, with the group singing, while dancing alone. The bridge features Harding sitting in front of a white background, wearing a nude bodysuit while abstract images are projected onto her. The video intercalates with stylized lyrics of the song, and builds throughout, until the last section, where the group abandon their various stages of walking and begin to dance together. Carl Williott of Idolator said the video matches the song's swagger with the UK quintet mugging for the camera, strutting around in those orange dresses and declaring 'Were the leaders of the pack'. James Robertson of Daily Mirror deemed the video perfect , praising the sexy faces and high tempo choreography. Girls Aloud first performed Something New on 16 November 2012 at Children in Need 2012. Emily Sheridan of Daily Mail summarized the performance saying, wearing the same orange off the shoulder tulip dresses from the Something New video, the girl group strutted about on stage with a troupe of hunky male dancers in suits. The group also performed the song at the Wembley special of Strictly Come Dancing, aired on 18 November 2012. Girls Aloud also joined Capital FM's 2012 Jingle Bell Ball, and they included Something New on the setlist. On 31 December 2012, they also performed it at the New Year's Eve special of Top of the Pops. In 2013, Something New was the last song performed during the Ten The Hits Tour before the encore.

The narrative begins on December 28, 2004, 98 days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. The leader of the survivors, Jack Shephard played by Matthew Fox develops appendicitis and Juliet Burke Elizabeth Mitchell operates on him. Meanwhile, James Sawyer Ford Josh Holloway , Miles Straume Ken Leung , Claire Littleton Emilie de Ravin , and her baby Aaron continue their trek to the beach from the Barracks. In a flashforward, Jack experiences visions of his deceased father Christian Shephard John Terry , while his relationship with Kate Austen Evangeline Lilly is strained soon after he proposes marriage. Kitsis said that the episode was interesting because a time, maybe brief, where Jack was happy. In flashforwards, Jack has returned to work as a doctor in Los Angeles. He is engaged to Kate and lives with her while helping to raise Aaron William Blanchette . Jack visits Hugo Hurley Reyes Jorge Garcia , who is in a mental institution. Hurley has not been taking his medication and suffering from hallucinations of his deceased friend, Charlie Pace Dominic Monaghan . He believes that the Oceanic Six have died and gone to heaven. Hurley gives Jack a message from Charlie You're not supposed to raise him. Charlie has also told Hurley that Jack will be receiving a visitor. On two separate occasions, Jack sees his father Jack asks his colleague Erika Stevenson April Parker Jones to prescribe him the anti anxiety drug clonazepam.

Aaron walks into the room as Jack blurts out that Kate and Aaron are not related. After feeling ill for a day, Jack faints. Juliet diagnoses him with appendicitis and deems an appendectomy necessary. She sends Sun Kwon Yunjin Kim to get medical supplies from the Staff Dharma Initiative medical station. Sun is accompanied by Jin Soo Kwon Daniel Dae Kim , Daniel Faraday Jeremy Davies and Charlotte Lewis Rebecca Mader the latter pair are increasingly distrusted by the survivors. Jin realizes that Charlotte is fluent in Korean and confronts her after their successful trip, threatening to hurt Daniel if she continues to lie about her agenda and does not get Sun off the island. Jack convinces Juliet to allow him to remain awake during the surgery, with Kate holding a mirror, so that he can see and direct the surgery. As Juliet operates, Jack's consciousness proves to be a detriment and her nursedentist Bernard Nadler Sam Anderson knocks him out with chloroform. The appendectomy is a success afterwards, Juliet tells Kate that Jack really does love Kate and not Juliet. En route back to the beach camp, Sawyer, distrustful of Miles, gives him a restraining order to keep him away from Claire as they travel to the survivors' beach camp with Claire's infant son, Aaron. On their way, Miles discovers the partially buried bodies of Danielle Rousseau Mira Furlan and Karl Blake Bashoff . They encounter Frank Lapidus Jeff Fahey , who saves their lives by instructing them to hide from the nearby band of mercenaries led by Martin Keamy Kevin Durand , who are revealed not to have been killed by the smoke monster in the previous episode. The mercenaries are on their way back to the helicopter to return to the freighter Kahana. At night, Miles watches Claire as she leaves with her deceased father, Christian.

The episode was written by March 10, 2008 and was done alongside The Shape of Things to Come and Cabin Fever . Shooting began by March 24, alongside filming of the previous episode and continued through April 4. The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict that he is in third season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is starting to close the loop on the end of season. Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack is strong. 'Something Nice Back Home' explains how he made that transition. When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that Jack has ... always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my life right now is pretty good, I don't want to end up here. In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that you could say motherhood suits her. In the flashforwards ... there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother ... taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues. Something Nice Back Home was viewed live or recorded and watched within four hours of broadcast by 10.726 million American viewers, scoring a 4.7 13 in the key adults 1849 demographic, ranking Lost as the twenty first most watched series of the week and setting a ratings low for the series.

Verne Gay of Newsday described it as another fine, fine Lost . The San Diego Union Tribune's Karla Peterson gave the episode an A , calling it one of those dense, chewy episodes in which a lot of stuff happened to a lot of people, and the foundation was laid for one hell of a season finale. She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in Something Nice Back Home , while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award. The Palm Beach Post's Kevin Thompson thought Matthew did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotionsscared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that Something Nice Back Home was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale and Jack's appendicitis the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. Combined with a strong character driven flash story, it was very old school Lost. Jensen also liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack Juliet smooch . TV Guide's Michael Ausiello wrote that Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was shocked and baffled and writing that Lost ... can give me an exciting, well done episode while making me fear where the series is going ... ghosts aren't my thing. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter decided that what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story Jack's flashforward this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. ... Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of other characters ... and giving them great story and character development . Daniel of TMZ graded Something Nice Back Home as a B . In his recap, he wrote that if that's the last we ever see of Claire again, that would be BEYOND awesome. Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fox's performance, saying that it was almost worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. The Star Ledger's Alan Sepinwall of gave the episode a mixed review, saying that I find and his love life simultaneously boring and obnoxious ... insufferable however, he enjoyed the subplots and commended the acting by Matthew Fox and Jorge Garcia. James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of the bad old flashbacks, in that it just reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past ... I didn't get much from it . IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5 10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. Carabott wrote that this season Lost's main character Jack seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle ... oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do and stated that the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward. Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that the pace ... was a bit too slow and I usually like the Jack centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for high drama or stimulating action however, he noted that all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special. Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson in 'The Shape of Things to Come' as Ben Linus and Henry Ian Cusick as Desmond Hume in 'The Constant' . Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called Something Nice Back Home a break after last week's action and information packed episode , argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles. UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that Something Nice Back Home would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not like Jack. Ben Rawson Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode three out of five stars, saying that the Jack Kate romantic intrigue is rather dull, while the appendix plot feels like an unnecessary narrative obstacle for viewers to surmount.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something%20Nice%20Back%20Home
"Something Old, Something New is the tenth episode of the fifth season of The Hills. It originally aired on MTV on May 31, 2009. In the episode, Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt prepare for their upcoming wedding, while Lauren Conrad and Lo Bosworth move out of their house. After much deliberation, Conrad decides to attend the nuptials, where she reconciles with Montag after being estranged with one another since the third season. It is the final episode in which Conrad appears, and also marks the entrance of her replacement Kristin Cavallari. Something Old, Something New was produced by Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Kristofer Lindquist, Sara Mast, and Sean Travis. After the season was retroactively divided into Part I and Part II, respectively separating installments featuring Conrad and Cavallari, the episode became the conclusion of Part I. Additionally, it is the second episode in the series' history with a one hour running time, the first being Paris Changes Everything in the third season. Something Old, Something New was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, who felt that Cavallari's introduction overshadowed Conrad's departure. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 2.7 million viewers in its original airing. The episode was released on DVD on October 6, 2009, packaged with the remainder of Part I of the fifth season. Lauren and Lo decide to host a farewell party as they prepare to move out of their house. As wedding preparations continue, Stephanie becomes upset after learning that Heidi has chosen her sister Holly as her maid of honor. During the bridal shower, Stephanie assumes the responsibilities after she becomes increasingly displeased with Holly's poor performance. After she makes amends with Spencer, Darlene gives him her blessing for the nuptials. While out for dinner, Brody tries to convince Lauren to attend the wedding, knowing that Heidi would appreciate her presence. In a later outing, Spencer tells Brody of his couples' therapy sessions with Heidi, but is displeased that he is not taken seriously. At the fashion public relations firm People's Revolution, Lauren tells Kelly that she will be leaving the company, which Kelly advocates as a smart decision that will help her to determine her next career endeavors. As an intoxicated Holly displays erratic behavior at Heidi and Spencer's rehearsal dinner, Stephanie is dismayed by her lack of irresponsibility. After Spencer explains that her behavior was inappropriate, Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation has been sent to a special guest. Charlie later tells Spencer that he invited Stacie, the bartender that Heidi clashed with for flirting with Spencer, to the wedding. Meanwhile, Brody and Stephanie make peace at Lauren and Lo's farewell party, while Lauren tells Stephanie that she will not be attending the ceremony. The following morning, the day of the wedding, Heidi and Spencer are getting ready, while guests begin entering the church. Lauren surprises Heidi in her dressing room and explains that Heidi's happiness is important to her. Meanwhile, Kristin Cavallari unexpectedly walks into the church and sits next to Justin, to the surprise of the attendees. After leaving Heidi, Lauren appears displeased after Lo tells her that Kristin is seated across from them. After the wedding has finished, Kristin tells Lo that she needs help finding a boyfriend, and to Audrina's disapproval, adds that Justin seems to be a stand up guy . Lauren makes her final appearance on the series quietly leaving the church, while Kristin catches Heidi's bouquet. Something Old, Something New was produced by Adam Divello, Liz Gateley, Kristofer Lindquist, Sara Mast, and Sean Travis. The episode became the second in the series' history with a one hour running time, preceded by Paris Changes Everything in the third season. Despite presenting Conrad and Bosworth's house departure as taking place the evening prior to Montag and Pratt's nuptials, the former event was filmed in January 2009, while the latter took place on April 25, 2009. Conrad first indicated that she wished to leave The Hills upon the conclusion of its fourth season in December 2008, looking to pursue other career opportunities. She commented that five years on TV is a really, really long time , adding that she was ready to walk away . However, per the producers' requests, Conrad filmed ten episodes for the fifth season, in which she closed her storylines. She added that the season was potentially its last, stating that series personnel felt her presence would give the show some sort of closure . In the July 2009 issue of Cosmopolitan, Conrad stated that producers had pressured her into a reconciliation with Montag throughout the season, adding that she was displeased when they would not allow otherwise.

"Something There is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for Walt Disney Pictures 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast 1991 . Sung by the majority of the film's main cast, the song was recorded by American actors Paige O'Hara as Belle and Robby Benson as the Beast via voice over, featuring actors Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury and David Ogden Stiers as Lumiere, Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth, respectively. The only song performed by the Beast, Something There is heard midway through Beauty and the Beast during a scene in which Belle and the Beast finally begin to acknowledge their feelings for each other. A last minute addition to the film, the simple love song was quickly written by Ashman and Menken to replace the more elaborate and ambitious Human Again after the latter was cut from Beauty and the Beast. O'Hara based her own vocal performance on that of American singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who Ashman advised the actress to impersonate, while O'Hara herself convinced the songwriters to have Benson record the song. Critical reception towards Something There has been positive, with film and music critics alike praising Ashman's abilities as both a songwriter and a storyteller. Something There was written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken. According to Menken, Something There was written as a very quick replacement for ... 'Human Again', the latter of which was ultimately cut from Beauty and the Beast because it was considered too ambitious for the film. Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because We just couldn't figure out how to make it work and not take away from the central story of Belle. Upon learning that Human Again was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple, the ultimate result of which was the love song Something There, which has been described as shorter and more direct than Human Again . The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence near the end of the film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work . In his biography I'm Not Dead... Yet , actor Robby Benson, voice of the Beast, revealed that it was co star Paige O'Hara's idea to have Benson's character duet with O'Hara's Belle in Something There . According to Benson, the actress explained to Ashman and Menken that had made records and sang in Broadway musicals. O'Hara briefly struggled to record one of the song's lines a bit alarming to which an ailing Ashman, who was forced to communicate with O'Hara and the studio via telephone from his hospital bed in New York due to his illness, simply responded Streisand. By this, Ashman meant that he wanted O'Hara to impersonate singer and actress Barbra Streisand, and by doing so O'Hara finally recorded the song successfully. Something There was recorded by O'Hara and Benson accompanied by a live orchestra. In the book The Meanings of Beauty and the Beast A Handbook, author Jerry Griswold observed that the Something There musical sequence is preceded by the once feisty Belle ... bandaging and nursing after he rescues her from the wolves. Contextually, the purpose of the song has been identified as Dramatizing Belle and the Beasts' partnership. Leading up to the musical sequence, the Beast first surprises Belle by showing her his library and then they learn to eat together. Author Robin O. Winter observed that During the scene they begin to see beneath their outer appearances and start to appreciate each other's inner qualities, while one critic identified this as one of the scenes in which Belle and the Beast hesitantly slowly open up to one another. Writing for Wesleyan University, Rachel Anne Silverman observed that Something There depicts The first time Belle and the Beast's attraction is introduced, describing the couple's relationship as a passion that has developed over time. Initially, Belle is alarmed as she realizes her growing love for the Beast, briefly hiding behind a tree as she sings. According to the Hal Leonard Corporation and Music Theatre International, the castle's staff of enchanted objects also discover something different between Belle and the Beast. Something There concludes with Belle and the Beast retreating to a fireplace and reading. In the original film, Something There immediately precedes the film's title song. However, for its special edition re release, the song is immediately followed by the newly reinstated Human Again . Identifying the song as where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in, Simon Brew of Den of Geek felt that Something There is the track with the heaviest workload. The author observed that In two minutes and 19 seconds, gets across just how the position and feelings of the characters have changed. For instance, At the beginning of 'Something There,' Belle admits that she thought the Beast was mean, coarse, and unrefined. By the end, shes feeling pretty smitten, according to Oh My Disney. The song also depicts the film's passing of time, while providing audiences with an opportunity to appreciate Beast and first see the potential for Belle and him. On the song's role in the special edition version of the film, co director Kirk Wise explained, There's a ... little suite of music now that starts with 'Something There' ... which segues into 'Human Again' which gives the object perspective on what they hope for when fall in love and that transitions into 'Beauty and the Beast' the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship. Dubbing the song soliloquies of Belle and the Beast, TV Guide drew comparisons between Something There and songs from the musical South Pacific. The Something There musical sequence was added towards the end of Beauty and the Beast's filmmaking process. Belle was animated by Mark Henn, while the Beast was animated by Aaron Blaise. Henn described Something There as a great sequence, continuing, I love to animate songs. The Los Angeles Times' Charles Solomon felt that Belle was drawn inconsistently throughout the film, observing that the character appears noticeably slimmer during Something There . Written in the key of D major at a quick allegretto tempo of 108 beats per minute in common time, the playful Something There is a Broadway musical inspired duet in which Belle and the Beast finally conclude that there's something there that wasn't there before. The song spans a duration of two minutes and eighteen seconds, making it the third shortest song on the soundtrack behind the reprises of Belle and Gaston , respectively. Describing Something There as a fluffy song, Filmtracks.com observed that the song shares many instrumental devices with 'Belle' one of Belle's verses in Something There serves as a reprise of the secondary phrase from 'Belle' . Combined, O'Hara and Benson's vocal ranges span two octaves, from the low note of G3to the high note of E5. The song, described as a poignant character number performed Against a background of the easy rhythms of soft, lilting violins, allowed O'Hara and Benson to blend their voices. In addition, Women's Studies in Communication observed that the tentative bursts of notes symbolize the uncertainties of this new way of relating . In the song's first verse, Belle articulates how her attraction to stems from his shut off demeanor, singing, There's something sweet And almost kind But he was mean And he was coarse and unrefined But now he's dear And so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before. The Beast's verse reads, when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw. According to Laurence E. MacDonald, author of the book The Invisible Art of Film Music A Comprehensive History, Benson shocked many filmgoers with his richly resonant baritone. Finally, Belle sings the song's bridge, which reads, New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be True, that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him that I simply didn't see. According to the Los Angeles Times, by the end of Something There , the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem. Something There has garnered mostly positive reviews from film and music critics. Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that Something There is where the genius of music as storytelling kicks in. In Brew's opinion, the utterly convincing and un mawkish song works because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other. Brew concluded, Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this. Filmtracks.com described Something There as an affable song. Particularly praising Ashman's songwriting, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Ashman's songs advance the plot by exploring the characters' emotions and making story points more concisely than conventional exposition. Solomon concluded, By the end of the deceptively simple sounding 'Something There,' the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem. O'Hara continues to cite Something There as her favorite of the film's songs, elaborating, Every time I see the Beast with that grin on his face and the bird in his hand, my heart just melts. For the studio's pending live action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, Julia Emmanuele of Hollywood.com suggested that the filmmakers feel free to drop 'Something There' if theres no room for it because it won't be missed. However, when English actress Emma Watson confirmed in January 2015 that she will be portraying Belle via Facebook, she cited Something There as one of her favorite songs from her childhood. Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic jokingly called Something There the closest the movie comes to admitting its horrendously inappropriate stance on human animal sexual relations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something%20There
"Something to Remember is a compilation album by American singer Madonna, released by Maverick Records on November 3, 1995. The album was conceived after a controversial period in Madonna's career, when many critics had speculated that her career had declined. It compiles ballads spanning over a decade of her career, including a reworked version of Love Don't Live Here Anymore and three new songs You'll See , One More Chance and a cover of Marvin Gaye's I Want You . The album also features previously released singles that had never been included on a Madonna album, I'll Remember and This Used to Be My Playground , and altogether provided a softer image for the singer during a critical period in her career. For producing the new songs for the album, Madonna worked with David Foster and Nellee Hooper. She stated that the concept for the album was to make fans and critics alike remember her musical talent rather than her media controversies. Something to Remember was well received by music critics who were impressed with Madonna's vocals and the album's cohesiveness. It was also a commercial success, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Finland, and Italy, and peaking within top ten elsewhere. In the United States, it reached number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA for shipments of three million units. Worldwide, Something to Remember has sold over ten million copies. Four singles and one promotional single were released to promote the album. Originally intended as the album's lead single, I Want You was released as the promotional single preceding the album, with a music video directed by Earle Sebastian. You'll See was released as the album's first single on October 23, 1995, accompanied by a Spanish version titled Veras and a music video directed by Michael Haussman. The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Austria, Canada, Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Oh Father , One More Chance and Love Don't Live Here Anymore were released as the follow up singles, but gained little commercial response the latter received a music video directed by Jean Baptiste Mondino. After a controversy fueled period, Madonna's personal life had started to dominate over her musical career. She knew it was time to make a change as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more to her than the constant media circus surrounding her. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of Madonna An Intimate Biography, documented that Madonna had previously stated that many of her songs have been overlooked in response to current trends, with her long time friend and producer Mirwais Ahmadzai stating she hasn't shouted about her musical abilities. Taraborrelli explained So, whether Madonna released Something to Remember, a collection of previously released love songs, because she had a point to prove or simply to keep a contractual obligation, the fourteen track recording did make a statement. Described as a love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike the compilation seemed to notify her contemporaries of her musical talent. On the album's liner note, Madonna further explained So much controversy has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs are all but forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate the idea of doing things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart. The new material for the album saw her collaboration with a well known producer David Foster, who had worked with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind Fire. Foster recalled the first time Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg contacting him for a dinner with the singer When Madonna first called, I was a little surprisedmy music isn't really hip enough for herbut I guess her camp thought we should meet, and I got a call from Liz Rosenberg, the PR maven who has been with Madonna from the beginning. Not long after the dinner, Madonna and Foster began the recording session in his Malibu studio. During the album conception, Madonna was also asked by her Bedtime Stories producer Nellee Hooper to collaborate with British trip hop group Massive Attack for a Marvin Gaye tribute album. Previously, the band had offered the collaboration to several artists, including Chaka Khan who rejected it. Madonna and Massive Attack covered Gaye's 1976 hit I Want You , which finished among the new material for Something to Remember and was also included on the Inner City Blues The Music of Marvin Gaye released by Motown Records. David Foster, about working with Madonna. The first track selected for use on the compilation album was Love Don't Live Here Anymore from Like a Virgin 1984 . The track was reworked by producer David Reitzas and features a different composition from the 1984 version. Madonna also included two soundtrack singles which had never been featured on her own album, This Used to Be My Playground from the 1992 film A League of Their Own and I'll Remember from the 1994 film With Honors. Other previously released material selected for the compilation were Crazy for You from Vision Quest 1985 , Live to Tell from True Blue 1986 , Oh Father from Like a Prayer 1989 , Something to Remember from I'm Breathless 1990 , Rain from Erotica 1992 , as well as Take a Bow and Forbidden Love , both from Bedtime Stories 1994 . Two tracks on the compilation, Crazy for You and Live to Tell , were overlapping with her first greatest hits album, The Immaculate Collection 1990 . According to Rikky Rooksby, the author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the song selection creates a soft atmosphere, the music is downbeat and emotionally introverted with mellow vibes throughout. Madonna's recording session with David Foster resulted two new songs to the final track listing, You'll See and One More Chance . Foster commented At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, You'll See , was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric You think that I can't live without your love You'll see and I thought my music was great. You'll See is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. Lyrically, the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied No, it's about empowering yourself. Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of You'll See in Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. Titled Veras , the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez. The next original song, One More Chance , is an acoustic ballad, whose lyrics are about attempting to win a lost lover back. The song was inspired by Madonna's real life experience, but she wrote it from the opposite point of view. Its composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars with plenty of chord changes and subdued strings. Nellee Hooper produced another new addition to the compilation, the cover version of Marvin Gaye's I Want You . After Madonna accepted Hooper's suggestion to collaborate with Massive Attack, the band sent Madonna the music of the song first. Robert 3D Del Naja, one of the band members, subsequently went to New York with Hooper and worked in the studio for two days. Del Naja said, I think the really cool thing about it was the fact that sang it so beautifully. There was no special effects, no messing aroundit was just in there singing it with a lot of passion and soul. The opening track of the compilation, I Want You starts with a long introduction featuring a hip hop drum beat with emphasis on the bass section of the instrumental alongside a semi tonal string figure. The second verse features a harp and a repeating drum loop accompanied with a telephone style bleeping sound. Madonna's vocals at times are accompanied by spoken passages with her overall vocals dominating the track, with lyrics discussing a man that no longer wants her, while she is determined to change his mind. The compilation closes with the orchestral version of I Want You in which the original drum track, bass and percussion are removed. The version starts slower with Madonna's vocals entering with a low string bass line only, gradually more string arrangements are added with harp and brass featured in the background of the mix. A moment towards the end of the track hears her voice with no accompaniment creating a dramatic theme, and overall the version features around 20 seconds less than the original. The album's artwork was taken from a shoot by fashion photographer Mario Testino, in which Madonna modelled Versace clothes for their upcoming Fall Winter 1995 campaign. Subsequently, other images taken from the shoot appeared in fashion magazines, such as Vanity Fair and Vogue Italia. The packaging included with the release showed Madonna looking deliciously cosmopolitan as she wore a tight fit white cocktail attire, while the back cover artwork is predominantly more playful. The front cover artwork presented Madonna leaning against a wall with an expression of romantic loss or absorption. Designed as the Madonna album which would appeal to a larger audience in contrast to her previous records, Bedtime Stories and Erotica, the booklet featured red roses inside and a golden yellow flower on the back cover. According to The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan who believed that Madonna removed her nose ring for the cover shot indicated she wants the album to be taken on its own merits. In 2013, the artwork was dubbed as one of the 20 Most Fashionable Album Covers Ever by the Dutch edition of Elle magazine. The title of the album derives from her 1990 song of the same name since it had received little attention during the release of its original album, I'm Breathless. Something to Remember was released in some European countries on November 3, 1995. In Madonna's native country, the album was released on November 7, 1995. In Japan, the album was released under the title Best of Madonna Ballad Collection on November 10, 1995, containing her 1986 song La Isla Bonita as a bonus track. La Isla Bonita was re released three months prior the compilation as a double A side record with Human Nature , the final single from Bedtime Stories. Receiving gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan RIAJ , the song was added to Something to Remember track listing in the hope of boosting the album sales in the region. In Latin America, the album included the bonus track Veras , the Spanish version of You'll See . In 2001, WEA Records released a box set of Something to Remember and The Immaculate Collection to coincide with the release of Madonna's second greatest hits package, GHV2. I Want You was released as a promotional single from the album on October 2, 1995. It was originally intended as the album's first single, but cancelled due to contract problems between Madonna's label and Motown Records, the copyright owner of the song. The music video for the song was directed by Earle Sebastian and was nominated for the MTV Amour category at the MTV Europe Music Awards 1996. You'll See was released as the album's lead single on October 30, 1995. The song reached the top five position in Austria, Canada, Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom. The single managed to peak at number six on the Billboard Hot 100, making Madonna the third act in history after Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye to have a hit peak at each position from one to ten on the chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman as a sequel to Madonna's previous music video for Take a Bow . Oh Father was released as the second single for European market on December 21, 1995. It became a top ten hit in Finland and achieved top 20 placement in the United Kingdom, but charted weakly in the rest of the continent, resulting a low peak of number 62 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. One More Chance received a limited single release in Australia and several European countries on March 7, 1996. Despite no promotion and no music video, the song still charted as high as number two in Italy and peaked inside the top 40 in Australia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Love Don't Live Here Anymore was released as the final single from the album on March 19, 1996. The song received poor commercial reception, peaking at number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top forty in Australia and Canada. Its accompanying music video was directed in by Jean Baptiste Mondino at the Confiteria El Molino in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during Madonna's day off from filming Evita. It was shot in a single frame portraying Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that Throughout the album, Madonna proves that she's a terrific singer whose voice has improved over the years. He added, Not one of the tracks is second rate, and the best songs on Something to Remember rank among the best pop music of the '80s and '90s . Neil Strauss of The New York Times felt all the songs on the album cohere better than a greatest hits package would and they tell a story of their own, of a voice and attitude that have hardened in the dozen years that have elapsed between the bubble gum chomping innocence of 1983's 'Crazy for You' and the tortured torch singing of the new 'You'll See'. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented By placing her greatest hit ballads 'Live to Tell', 'Crazy for You', 'Take a Bow', etc. in a new contextthat is, separated from her more attention getting dance musicMadonna reinvigorates them, which is just what a good best of compilation is supposed to do. The three new songs 'You'll See', 'One More Chance', and a wonderfully eerie version of Marvin Gaye's 'I Want You' are consumer enticements that just add to the allure. According to Greg Forman from The Post and Courier, the album shows that There's an important difference between having a great voice and being a great singer. Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey can sing circles and octaves around the most famous woman on the planet, but Madonna, through sheer force of personality sells her slow numbers with a panache few modern singers can match. John Wirt from The Advocate said that the album shows that Madonna can craft slow songs as effectively as she knocks out dance numbers and found an unaffected simplicity and sincerity in her ballad singing. Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine believed that with the album Madonna not only reminds us that there's more to her music than dance tunes, but also demonstrates that her voice is nowhere near as thin and chirpy as her detractors imagine. He further explained, one of the most amazing things about the album is how sultry and assured she sounds ... The Madonna on display here not only has a richer, deeper voice than you imagined, but more interpretive insight as well. Alwyn W. Turner in the book The Rough Guide to Rock stated that the album features the best of her slow pieces displaying that Madonna had evolved over the years into an excellent ballad singer. Edna Gundersen from USA Today said that the album flaunts the less sizzling, though equally galvanizing, highlights of her career. She was mostly impressed with Madonna's vocal and emotional power on the track You'll See which became the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity. J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts, saying It was interesting that, with all of his exciting musical ability from which to draw, he and Madonna would come up with two of the most sombre songs she has ever recordedbut such is the excitement of collaboration one never knows what will come of it. Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs show a great leap in sophistication and felt that Madonna has invested much in improving her vocal technique. Robert Christgau criticized the album giving it a dud rating, and indicating it as a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought .

After the opening crawl an Imperial Star Destroyer deploys a series of probe droids in search of the Rebel Alliance. One of the probe droids Joe lands on the ice planet Hoth, where the Rebels have set up a base. Rebel commander Luke Skywalker Chris is patrolling when he is attacked by a large wampa Cookie Monster and taken back to its lair. At the base, Han Solo Peter announces his intention to leave the Rebellion to Princess Leia Lois and Carlist Rieekan Dr. Hartman , with Leia objecting to his decision, however she denies it when confronted, saying she would rather kiss George Takei. When he finds out that Luke has not yet returned, Han sets out on his Dondon to find him. Luke escapes the wampa lair and has a vision of his late mentor Obi Wan Kenobi Herbert , who tells him to go to the Dagobah system to learn the ways of the Force from Jedi Master Yoda, after offering him a bowl of Zima soup.

Yoda initially doesn't want him to go, but encourages it after Luke suggests Yoda fight Vader himself. Han and the others go to Cloud City on the planet Bespin to obtain help from Han's friend Lando Calrissian Mort , the only black guy in the galaxy , only to be turned over to Darth Vader. Han willingly reveals the location of Luke and the Rebel base but is tortured by being forced to listen to Paula Cole's Where Have All the Cowboys Gone , as punishment for clogging a toilet on the 16th floor of Cloud City, which forced Vader to use the little pig people's bathroom. Han is used to test a carbon freezing chamber Vader intends to use on Luke to take him to the Emperor. Leia professes her love to Han, but Han tells her to fuck off and is then frozen in carbonite for posterity. Lando later double crosses the Empire, freeing Leia, Chewbacca and C 3PO, motivating the guards with a pizza party. Despite R2 D2 having sex with the combination lock, and subsequently being discovered by her husband, to get the door open, they are too late to stop Boba Fett from flying off with Han. Luke arrives at Cloud City and, after being briefly interrupted by Ryan Seacrest on American Idol, engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader goads Luke to join the dark side, revealing that he is his father. Luke casts himself into an air shaft and, after discovering that a worker has shoved his severed hand down his pants, ends up hanging on an antenna beneath the city, calling out to Ben, Leia, and Tom Selleck. Leia senses Luke's call from within the Millennium Falcon and has him rescued. On board a Nebulon B frigate, Luke is fitted with an artificial hand, but told to practice masturbating with a hot dog first. Lando, dressed in Han's clothes, sets off with Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon to rescue Han. Luke angrily protests the story's ambiguous ending, but then he receives a letter from Doc Brown, a reference to the ending of Back to the Future Part II. In the Griffins' home, the power returns as Peter finishes his story, only to get into another argument with Chris over Robot Chicken. Chris vows to not let Peter get his goat this time, but eventually storms off when Peter brings up Without a Paddle. The episode was written by series regular Kirker Butler, before the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike, and before his leave from the series in order to become co executive producer of the Family Guy spinoff series The Cleveland Show. Butler wrote the first draft of the episode in four weeks, under the guidance of series creator Seth MacFarlane. The episode was directed by Dominic Polcino, who had previously directed Blue Harvest . This was the last episode in the series to use hand drawn animatics, before transitioning to computer designed animatics. In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Jon Benjamin reprised his role as Carl, who portrays Yoda, and Sheriff John Bunnell made his second appearance in the series, the first being in the eighth season episode Quagmire's Baby . Actor James Woods, in his third appearance in the series, as an exaggerated version of himself, guest starred. Actors James Caan, Jackson Douglas and Joe Flaherty, along with voice actors James Greene, Phil LaMarr, Kevin Michael Richardson and George Rogan made appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Johnny Brennan, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, Wally Wingert, writers Kirker Butler, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, John Viener, writer and showrunner Mark Hentemann, and producer Chris Sheridan also made minor appearances in the episode. Live action clips of actor Dolph Lundgren, actress Brigitte Nielsen and actor Michael Pataki from the film Rocky IV, and actor Tom Selleck from the film Her Alibi were also used in multiple sequences throughout the episode. The DVD release of Blue Harvest on January 15, 2008, contained an easter egg of a brief read through of bits from Something, Something, Something, Dark Side , as well as a teaser trailer for the episode as another easter egg. The title of this episode is a reference to a specific line from the season five episode Barely Legal , which was used in a cutaway relating to Star Wars. The line is an inside joke relating to the Emperor figuring out the formula for great dialogue for Star Wars. While the Emperor talks to a kneeling Darth Vader, he says Something, something, something, dark side. Something, something, something, complete . Barely Legal was written by Kirker Butler, who also wrote this episode. As the episode opens with a shot of the Griffin family, they are seen sitting in front of the television watching a parody of several Aaron Sorkin shows, including Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, entitled The Kitchen. Once the scene ends, the power unexpectedly goes out, to which Stewie responds by asking What are we in, Iraq Reminiscent of the previous Star Wars inspired episode, Blue Harvest , Meg insists her father tell another story about Star Wars. Peter then begins to retell the film Black Snake Moan before being interrupted by Stewie and Chris. In the same fashion as the original Star Wars films, the story opens with a large, yellow crawl of text, with the text in this variation calling out 20th Century Fox for their lack of foresight in terms of merchandising rights, thus allowing George Lucas and Lucasfilm to keep all the rights to every film in the Star Wars franchise. The text then addresses the stockholders of 20th Century Fox, and cites Family Guy's two cancellations as another example of the company's short sighted decisions, and spending budget money in a useless manner. As the Imperial Fleet approaches, a Star Destroyer deploys Elroy Jetson, a character from the Hanna Barbera animated sitcom The Jetsons, along with a series of probe droids. Elroy Jetson proceeds to the Little Dipper School, in imitation of the original intro to The Jetsons. One of the probe droids, portrayed by Joe Swanson, then lands in the snow near Luke Skywalker. Luke mistakes the droid for a meteorite and approaches the device, before being attacked by a snow beast, which looks like Cookie Monster from PBS' Sesame Street. The character had previously appeared in the fourth season episode Model Misbehavior as a cookie addict . Before leaving, Han Solo runs into Princess Leia, who insists on Han staying with her. Apologizing to Leia for having to leave her, Han gives her his e mail address, which is hosted by the nearly defunct company CompuServe at hansolo64 compuserve.com. Han Solo then questions why Leia wants him to stay, and suggests that she is afraid that she will not get a goodbye kiss before he leaves. Leia then mulls over the thought, and tells him that she would rather kiss Star Trek actor George Takei. Abruptly entering, C 3PO and R2 D2 alert Han Solo of Luke Skywalker's disappearance. Han goes out to look for Luke on his Dondon , which has the body of a tauntaun, and the head of the late actor Don Knotts. Once Han locates Luke, the late comedian Rodney Dangerfield appears, to which Han responds, There are way too many elderly comedians out here in the snow. Before being rescued, Han first appears in a 1980s commercial for the chewing gum Juicy Fruit, with the original audio from the commercial and Juicy Fruit's current logo. The sequence was originally planned for the fifth season episode Road to Rupert , with Stewie and Brian taking the place of Peter. Continuing on their approach to the Hoth system, the Imperial Fleet passes by a mailbox with the surname 'Nimoy' on it. Darth Vader, as portrayed by Stewie, hits the mailbox with a baseball bat as the ship passes. As the Imperial Walkers, or robot camels , begin to approach the rebels, one of the rebels looks through his binoculars at the group of robots and spots one of the Walkers wearing Crocs, a type of shoe reminiscent of the wooden clog but made out of plastic. When Luke's aircraft is shot down during the battle, he contacts OnStar, a company that provides vehicle security. As Han decides to outrun a series of TIE fighters, Sheriff John Bunnell then begins narrating the chase, in a parody of World's Wildest Police Videos, which Bunnell hosted from 1998 to 2002. This is Family Guy's second reference to the show, as well as Bunnell's second appearance in the series. His first appearance was in Quagmire's Baby , which first aired shortly before the DVD release of Something, Something, Something, Dark Side . Han then seemingly goes through an asteroid field, much to Leia's chagrin. Han responds by stating that it is better than going through the nearby strawberry field, with The Beatles members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison then appearing. The other Beatles are then seen teasing Paul about Heather Mills having one leg, calling her Peg and Eileen . After much maneuvering, Han is able to escape the TIE fighters, eventually parking in a handicapped zone, citing vertigo as his medical condition. This leads Leia to question Han's decision making, and causes Han to film a video confession similar to those on the MTV reality show The Real World. While departing Hoth, Luke meets Flash Gordon, the title character to the 1954 television series that inspired Lucas to create Star Wars. When Luke reaches the Dagobah system, he crash lands into a swamp, prompting Allstate spokesperson and actor Dennis Haysbert to appear, in a parody of his commercials. Haysbert was reportedly approached to voice himself, but rejected the offer for unspecified reasons. Later getting out of the crashed ship, R2 D2 is eaten and spat back out by a swamp monster, prompting R2 to question what else is located beneath the swamp water. The Legion of Doom lair then rises from the swamp, which angers Luke. After Luke meets him, Yoda, as portrayed by Carl, reveals that the secret to mastering the Force is to check out sweet ass DVD releases , and goes on to reference several films, including National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Iron Man, as well as Iron Man's director Jon Favreau. A montage depicts Luke performing various athletic feats under Yoda's guidance, interlaced with clips of Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago from the 1985 film Rocky IV. Going on to test Luke's knowledge of various films, Yoda begins to ask the best and worst naked chick scenes, with Luke responding by citing the best as Rebecca De Mornay in Risky Business, and the worst as Kathy Bates in About Schmidt. Yoda then asks about the best scene in the 1985 film Teen Wolf and Luke picks the scene in which Michael J. Fox in wolf make up opens the bathroom door to see his father is also a werewolf. Yoda says Luke is correct, but that he also would have accepted the end celebration in which an extra allegedly exposes himself. Once the Emperor, portrayed by Carter Pewterschmidt, contacts Darth Vader, he first begins by telling him that he is getting rid of all his CDs because he is downloading all his music to his new iPod , then proceeds to list several albums, including singer Natalie Merchant's 1995 album Tigerlily, Alanis Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill, and finally Richard Marx's single Hold On to the Nights , the last of which Darth Vader excitedly agrees to take. Calling upon various bounty hunters, Darth Vader reviews a lineup of auditioning hunters, including Dog the Bounty Hunter, IG 88, Zuckuss, Bossk, Boba Fett as portrayed by the Giant Chicken, and finally Raggedy Andy, who Vader angrily dismisses. During a confrontation with Han, Darth Vader deflects lasers using his gloves and sings the theme song from the Wonder Woman television series. Once Han Solo is captured by Darth Vader, he is tortured into confessing his clogging one of the bathrooms on Cloud City. Vader then forces Han to listen to Paula Cole's Where Have All the Cowboys Gone on full blast. When Luke lands on Cloud City to fight Vader, he is first subjected to appearing on the popular reality competition American Idol, with Ryan Seacrest as host of the ensuing lightsaber battle before he is quickly killed by Luke. After losing his battle against Darth Vader, Luke falls to the bottom of the floating city and calls out for Leia, along with Obi Wan and actor Tom Selleck, the last of which is then seen briefly looking up from his book in a real life cameo from the movie Her Alibi. Sensing this, Leia then orders Chewbacca to turn the ship around, prompting a parody of Vicki Sue Robinson's single Turn The Beat Around , reworded to Turn the Ship Around . As the story comes to a close, Luke interrupts the ending sequence and raises the viewer's awareness to all of the unanswered questions that the movie leaves behind. The Western Union postal worker from the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II then appears, and hands Luke a message delivered by Doc Brown from the year 1885, with the story then ending on the words To be Concluded , in the same fashion of Back to the Future. Composer Alan Silvestri allowed the producers to use his Back to the Future theme since he's a fan of Family Guy. The episode then cuts back to the Griffin family household, with Peter immediately rehashing the argument between him and Chris that first started in Blue Harvest , a joke grounded in the fact that Chris' voice actor, Seth Green, is one of the creators and producers of the stop motion comedy series Robot Chicken. Peter begins by suggesting that Robot Chicken would never be able to top the story he had just told. Hearing this, Chris defends Robot Chicken. Peter continues to poke at Chris and finally states that he may have more time to tell another story entitled Without a Paddle, a critically panned movie in which Seth Green starred. Chris then angrily storms off yelling Fuck you to Peter.

Reviews of the television broadcast were highly positive, praising its close attention to detail in parodying the original film. Jason Hughes of TV Squad found the episode to be incredibly , going on to note, As much as we fans love the films, we know they're not perfect, and that they're downright ridiculous in places. Family Guy managed to point out virtually all of those moments in this parody. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found the episode to have a lot of solid laughs , and admired the show for throwing itself into these outsized movie parody things . Critics of the DVD and Blu ray Disc releases gave the episode high praise for its ability to accurately reflect the original film.
